  Four high-tech industrial spies, Beaupre, Alice, Jernigan and Unger, steal a top-secret microchip, and, to fool customs, hide it in a remote-control toy car. Through a baggage mix-up at the airport, grumpy old Mrs.Hess gets the toy and gives it to her neighbor, 8-year-old Alex. Spies want to get the toy back before their clients get angry and decide to burglarize every house at Alex's street to find the chip. But Alex is prepared for their visit...

    In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy with layered characters and genuine emotional beats. Ten years on he's reduced to recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' for a second time in a lazy film that is not connected to the other movies but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Macaulay Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would have stopped Hughes from repeating the same old routines a third time, but the only surprise is that he had just enough dignity to skip 'Home Alone 4'.

    One word to describe this film: Why. Home Alone 1 and 2 are my childhood. I love them, they are awesome, the idea is so great. But then it has to continue, because great franchises have to be ruined at some point! I'd be so happy if they would've stopped after the second movie, but no. Home Alone 3 is a bad movie, and should have nothing to do with the original two. If I would've had the idea to make this movie, I would've stopped it right when Culkin announced that he is not going to be in it. Home Alone without him is like eating pizza in your house without the pizza and the house. And instead of recasting him, which would've been a little bit better (though still not wise), they create new characters. With no same characters or actors than in the first two movies, I feel right to say that this is not Home Alone. The title of the movie is wrong, it should be called "The lame adventures of a random kid" or something like that. The idea of the movie is another reason for it having nothing to do with Home Alone except for the title. I mean, Home Alone: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks". Home Alone 2: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks in New York". Home Alone 3: "A high-tech North Korean terrorist organization seek for a microchip blah blah blah". I understand that sometimes a movie series must change its theme for a different audience. It has worked with Star Trek (2009), Matrix Reloaded and many others. But with this, it does not work. At all. In any way. It is just wrong. It's like AC/DC publishing a dubstep album. This isn't even a very funny movie, as they have changed the hilarious sarcasm into stupid puns, and amusing comical situations into cheesy clich&eacute;s. Do not watch this, I don't recommend it to anyone.

    I honestly don't consider Home Alone 3 to be a cinematic masterpiece, the first two Home Alone films are holiday classics, but the fourth instalment makes the third look on par with the first two. Instead of Kevin Macalester, we have Alex playing as our main character, he is left home alone deliberately, and he is left to deal with four burglars who are finding a microchip, which was left in a toy car he was given. I liked the parrot, and the slapstick was still quite inventive. Though it is a flawed sequel, Home Alone 3 still entertained me. If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed

Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed

    In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy with layered characters and genuine emotional beats. Ten years on he's reduced to recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' for a second time in a lazy film that is not connected to the other movies but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Macaulay Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would have stopped Hughes from repeating the same old routines a third time, but the only surprise is that he had just enough dignity to skip 'Home Alone 4'.

    One word to describe this film: Why. Home Alone 1 and 2 are my childhood. I love them, they are awesome, the idea is so great. But then it has to continue, because great franchises have to be ruined at some point! I'd be so happy if they would've stopped after the second movie, but no. Home Alone 3 is a bad movie, and should have nothing to do with the original two. If I would've had the idea to make this movie, I would've stopped it right when Culkin announced that he is not going to be in it. Home Alone without him is like eating pizza in your house without the pizza and the house. And instead of recasting him, which would've been a little bit better (though still not wise), they create new characters. With no same characters or actors than in the first two movies, I feel right to say that this is not Home Alone. The title of the movie is wrong, it should be called "The lame adventures of a random kid" or something like that. The idea of the movie is another reason for it having nothing to do with Home Alone except for the title. I mean, Home Alone: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks". Home Alone 2: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks in New York". Home Alone 3: "A high-tech North Korean terrorist organization seek for a microchip blah blah blah". I understand that sometimes a movie series must change its theme for a different audience. It has worked with Star Trek (2009), Matrix Reloaded and many others. But with this, it does not work. At all. In any way. It is just wrong. It's like AC/DC publishing a dubstep album. This isn't even a very funny movie, as they have changed the hilarious sarcasm into stupid puns, and amusing comical situations into cheesy clich&eacute;s. Do not watch this, I don't recommend it to anyone.

    I honestly don't consider Home Alone 3 to be a cinematic masterpiece, the first two Home Alone films are holiday classics, but the fourth instalment makes the third look on par with the first two. Instead of Kevin Macalester, we have Alex playing as our main character, he is left home alone deliberately, and he is left to deal with four burglars who are finding a microchip, which was left in a toy car he was given. I liked the parrot, and the slapstick was still quite inventive. Though it is a flawed sequel, Home Alone 3 still entertained me. If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed

    In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy with layered characters and genuine emotional beats. Ten years on he's reduced to recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' for a second time in a lazy film that is not connected to the other movies but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Macaulay Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would have stopped Hughes from repeating the same old routines a third time, but the only surprise is that he had just enough dignity to skip 'Home Alone 4'.

    One word to describe this film: Why. Home Alone 1 and 2 are my childhood. I love them, they are awesome, the idea is so great. But then it has to continue, because great franchises have to be ruined at some point! I'd be so happy if they would've stopped after the second movie, but no. Home Alone 3 is a bad movie, and should have nothing to do with the original two. If I would've had the idea to make this movie, I would've stopped it right when Culkin announced that he is not going to be in it. Home Alone without him is like eating pizza in your house without the pizza and the house. And instead of recasting him, which would've been a little bit better (though still not wise), they create new characters. With no same characters or actors than in the first two movies, I feel right to say that this is not Home Alone. The title of the movie is wrong, it should be called "The lame adventures of a random kid" or something like that. The idea of the movie is another reason for it having nothing to do with Home Alone except for the title. I mean, Home Alone: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks". Home Alone 2: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks in New York". Home Alone 3: "A high-tech North Korean terrorist organization seek for a microchip blah blah blah". I understand that sometimes a movie series must change its theme for a different audience. It has worked with Star Trek (2009), Matrix Reloaded and many others. But with this, it does not work. At all. In any way. It is just wrong. It's like AC/DC publishing a dubstep album. This isn't even a very funny movie, as they have changed the hilarious sarcasm into stupid puns, and amusing comical situations into cheesy clich&eacute;s. Do not watch this, I don't recommend it to anyone.

    I honestly don't consider Home Alone 3 to be a cinematic masterpiece, the first two Home Alone films are holiday classics, but the fourth instalment makes the third look on par with the first two. Instead of Kevin Macalester, we have Alex playing as our main character, he is left home alone deliberately, and he is left to deal with four burglars who are finding a microchip, which was left in a toy car he was given. I liked the parrot, and the slapstick was still quite inventive. Though it is a flawed sequel, Home Alone 3 still entertained me. If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed

    In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy with layered characters and genuine emotional beats. Ten years on he's reduced to recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' for a second time in a lazy film that is not connected to the other movies but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Macaulay Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would have stopped Hughes from repeating the same old routines a third time, but the only surprise is that he had just enough dignity to skip 'Home Alone 4'.

    One word to describe this film: Why. Home Alone 1 and 2 are my childhood. I love them, they are awesome, the idea is so great. But then it has to continue, because great franchises have to be ruined at some point! I'd be so happy if they would've stopped after the second movie, but no. Home Alone 3 is a bad movie, and should have nothing to do with the original two. If I would've had the idea to make this movie, I would've stopped it right when Culkin announced that he is not going to be in it. Home Alone without him is like eating pizza in your house without the pizza and the house. And instead of recasting him, which would've been a little bit better (though still not wise), they create new characters. With no same characters or actors than in the first two movies, I feel right to say that this is not Home Alone. The title of the movie is wrong, it should be called "The lame adventures of a random kid" or something like that. The idea of the movie is another reason for it having nothing to do with Home Alone except for the title. I mean, Home Alone: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks". Home Alone 2: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks in New York". Home Alone 3: "A high-tech North Korean terrorist organization seek for a microchip blah blah blah". I understand that sometimes a movie series must change its theme for a different audience. It has worked with Star Trek (2009), Matrix Reloaded and many others. But with this, it does not work. At all. In any way. It is just wrong. It's like AC/DC publishing a dubstep album. This isn't even a very funny movie, as they have changed the hilarious sarcasm into stupid puns, and amusing comical situations into cheesy clich&eacute;s. Do not watch this, I don't recommend it to anyone.

    I honestly don't consider Home Alone 3 to be a cinematic masterpiece, the first two Home Alone films are holiday classics, but the fourth instalment makes the third look on par with the first two. Instead of Kevin Macalester, we have Alex playing as our main character, he is left home alone deliberately, and he is left to deal with four burglars who are finding a microchip, which was left in a toy car he was given. I liked the parrot, and the slapstick was still quite inventive. Though it is a flawed sequel, Home Alone 3 still entertained me. If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed

    In 1987, John Hughes wrote and directed 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', which was a hilarious and poignant comedy with layered characters and genuine emotional beats. Ten years on he's reduced to recycling the plot of 'Home Alone' for a second time in a lazy film that is not connected to the other movies but is equally uninspired and sadistic. The four crooks  that's right, four! And one of them is a girl! Congratulations, Hughes, for introducing this revolutionary change to the series!  are electrocuted with metal chairs, brained with barbells and blinded with paint, ha ha ha haaaaaaaa ha, while the new kid is even less charming than Macaulay Culkin. You'd think the departure of almost all the key players from the first two films would have stopped Hughes from repeating the same old routines a third time, but the only surprise is that he had just enough dignity to skip 'Home Alone 4'.

    One word to describe this film: Why. Home Alone 1 and 2 are my childhood. I love them, they are awesome, the idea is so great. But then it has to continue, because great franchises have to be ruined at some point! I'd be so happy if they would've stopped after the second movie, but no. Home Alone 3 is a bad movie, and should have nothing to do with the original two. If I would've had the idea to make this movie, I would've stopped it right when Culkin announced that he is not going to be in it. Home Alone without him is like eating pizza in your house without the pizza and the house. And instead of recasting him, which would've been a little bit better (though still not wise), they create new characters. With no same characters or actors than in the first two movies, I feel right to say that this is not Home Alone. The title of the movie is wrong, it should be called "The lame adventures of a random kid" or something like that. The idea of the movie is another reason for it having nothing to do with Home Alone except for the title. I mean, Home Alone: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks". Home Alone 2: "A family comedy about a kid who is left alone and must defend himself with clever traps from two hilarious and dumb crooks in New York". Home Alone 3: "A high-tech North Korean terrorist organization seek for a microchip blah blah blah". I understand that sometimes a movie series must change its theme for a different audience. It has worked with Star Trek (2009), Matrix Reloaded and many others. But with this, it does not work. At all. In any way. It is just wrong. It's like AC/DC publishing a dubstep album. This isn't even a very funny movie, as they have changed the hilarious sarcasm into stupid puns, and amusing comical situations into cheesy clich&eacute;s. Do not watch this, I don't recommend it to anyone.

    I honestly don't consider Home Alone 3 to be a cinematic masterpiece, the first two Home Alone films are holiday classics, but the fourth instalment makes the third look on par with the first two. Instead of Kevin Macalester, we have Alex playing as our main character, he is left home alone deliberately, and he is left to deal with four burglars who are finding a microchip, which was left in a toy car he was given. I liked the parrot, and the slapstick was still quite inventive. Though it is a flawed sequel, Home Alone 3 still entertained me. If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

If you are looking for family classics; watch the first two films, but if you like third instalments, then give this film a go. 7/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    Home Alone 3 tells a whole different story then the original two. Instead of the McCallisters, we meet the Pruitt family and in particular the main character Alex. A computer chip worth ten million dollars is placed into a toy car by our four villains in an attempt to get through airport security. There is a mix up at the airport, and the toy car ends up in the possession of an older woman who gives it to little Alex as a gift. The four bad guys track the car to a neighbourhood in Chicago and break into a series of houses looking for the chip. Alex (who is HOME ALONE with chicken pox) see's the crooks breaking into the houses an calls the cops, only to look like a prank caller each time. The villains looking for the chip eventually realize that little Alex has it and that's when the fun begins - Home Alone style. I actually enjoyed Home Alone 3 as a kid and as an adult now. No, it isn't as good as the original films and no Alex Linz is not Macaulay Culkin. But this movie gets points for breaking off from the McCallister storyline. I mean how many times can that family forget the same kid? Young actor Alex Linz who plays Alex in Home Alone 3 does a great job taking on this big role, he manages to not put in an annoying performance like so many child actors can be do these kind of movies. The crooks include three men and one female, and I like that they added a woman into that villain role. They all are good actors and add plenty to this movie. The best comedic moments come from the crooks, especially David Thornton as 'Unger'. There are some ho-hum funny moments which fall flat such as the talking parrot and a few scenes with Alex's older brother and sister who "torment" him. Another flaw was the actual "home alone" bit, and the fact that Alex isn't really home alone as we've seen in the first two films. His mother leaves him for a couple of hours as he recuperates from Chicken Pox, hardly the same as Kevin McCallister went through. And I don't like that it doesn't take place ON Christmas. But those drawbacks don't take away from the whole movie at all. Home Alone 3 isn't great, but it takes some risks by moving from the original plot and adds some smarts it with the computer chip story. These aren't your simple criminals like the wet bandits were, they are after far more than some jewellery and expensive silverware. I recommend Home Alone 3 for sure! 6/10

    Alex is target by four international terrorists, in one of the most thrilling action movies ever made.

    What can be said about Home Alone 3 apart from it being the greatest film of all time? The fact that it didn't win every single Oscar in 1997 is a downright outrage. The reason is due to the fact that Macaulay Culkin ruined the franchise in the first two films, before Alex D. Linz was tasked with salvaging the remnants. When four terrorists target Alex while he is off school, he outwits and outmatches them. The main competitive advantage Home Alone 3 brings to the table is the fact that there are four villains. This means that there are more traps, more action, more laughs and more enjoyment. Furthermore, the role of Alex's sister was the role that launched the career of Scarlett Johansson. Without this movie, it is safe to say that she would have had no part in the Avengers, Hancock, and most importantly, the Spongebob Squarepants Movie. There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie, and it lived up to all reviews. 10/10, an act of pure class.

    I recently started to have a home alone marathon from the original to this, so while i reached Home Alone 3 i started to find out more about the supporting actors what they are doing now and all and i could not believe this movie is rated so poorly, as a kid i loved it, the pranks on the crooks are hilarious, but most people wanted Kevin back but the truth is he too grown up by 1997, look at me i am 20 and still watching this movie there has to be a reason why i still enjoy this, this movie is awesome. People should give more credit to this movie, i think Raja Gosnell did a very good job. Too bad John Williams do the music for this music but i think Nick Glennie-Smith did okay. The crooks in this movies are awesome in this movie too. Alex D. Linz acting was great as well as the supporting actors. The fact is people shouldn't compare any sequels to the previous movies unless they have the same characters, if its a new story with new characters and all they should never compare the movie to the originals. This movie falls into my all time favorite list.

    I have to review this title purely for the fact that the first 2 films were brilliant and the 3rd and 4th are an insult to the originals. When I say review, I don't actually mean review because the only thing I can think of is bad, terrible and one of the worst movies I've ever seen along with Batman & Robin. The story is the same but the burglars are a parody an do some of the worst acting I have ever seen. When you consider the flawless acting of Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern in Home Alone 1 & 2 it's such a shame that they made the next two so badly. Please don't waste your time with the 3rd and 4th just stick the 1st and 2nd on instead. I give it a generous 1.

    *** SPOILER ALERT *** I think the problem with trying to turn out sequels to Home Alone is that that the original concept is not something that you can build on.&nbsp;Here you have a premise of a kid left home alone who has to use physical stunts and painful booby traps to defend the house from adults who want to do him harm.&nbsp;That's not exactly an epic idea.&nbsp;It wasn't a thoroughly ingenious concept for the first one and the sequels only make it worse. Home Alone 3 reeks of desperation.&nbsp;Every element that made the other two films endearing to kids is gone and has been replaced by insufficient copies.&nbsp;Gone are the entire original cast, Macaulay Culkin is now a teenager and wisely turned down an offer to make this movie.&nbsp;Gone are Joe Peschi and Daniel Stern who obviously have better things to do.&nbsp;What remains is a name-only sequel  a remake really  that offers no hints of what turned Home Alone into the best-selling comedy of all time. Culkin has been replaced by a new kid, Alex D. Linz, a cute little mop-top who probably has screen presence but, for me, is nothing more than your standard Hollywood acting kid.&nbsp;Linz plays Alex Pruitt, a different kid who lives in the same kind of suburban Chicago neighborhood with a smaller family (mom, dad, a brother and a sister, who is played by Scarlett Johannson), and an even smaller house.&nbsp;As the movie opens, he gets the chicken pox, which never seems to spread beyond a few small red dots on his neck.&nbsp;He's one of those kids fused with ingenuity and a room loaded with every toy imaginable, including his own telescope and a large pet mouse named Doris. The outside forces that invade Alex's space come from four all-star professional criminals who are tracking a computer chip that they have stolen from a North Korean terrorist group.&nbsp;In an effort to get it past airport security, they hide it inside a remote controlled car and put it inside a shopping bag.&nbsp;At the metal detector, the bag is mistakenly picked up by an elderly woman who takes it home.&nbsp;The crooks track her to her neighborhood but can't locate the toy car.&nbsp;That means they will have to search them all one by one. Alex spots the crooks through his telescope and, unlike Culkin's character, at least has the sense to call the cops right away.&nbsp;The crooks make a break for it before the cops can show up, and that leads to two irritating scenes in which Alex is able to identify the perpetrators AND their car, but the adults are too stupid to do anything but warn him about making phony phone calls . . . twice! As the crooks zero in on Alex, he decides that he has to take care of things himself and that leads to a long, very long, third act in which he sets up a large series of booby traps that include bricks to the head, shots to groin, electrocution, break-away floors, and even a runaway lawnmower.&nbsp;Those scenes are sheer torture, they go on and on and on and on until you just want to wave a white flag.&nbsp;Much to my pain and suffering, as I sat through Home Alone 3, I could imagine that no movie this bad could possibly spawn a Home Alone 4.&nbsp;We'll see.

    The film is about Alex Pruitt played by Alex D. Linz who has come down with a bad case with the chickenpox. Meanwhile a toy car that Alex got has a device that 4 criminals have put in the toy and are now Coming After Alex and Wackyness and Zanyness ensues. This is definitely not the best in the series but it still entertaining to watch and does have some funny parts. The story is nice and the kid does fit perfectly in this movie. But there really is no reason why this had to be made because we all know the first 2 are a tough act to follow so at least give the movie credit for trying and this is really how the series should have ended. I repeat, SHOULD HAVE ENDED! Check this movie out. Rated PG For Slapstick Violence, Language And Mild Sensuality. 1hr 42min/102min. ***/****

    Feel we must add our voice to the people who view this as an under rated film, no way it deserves to be a 3.7 on IMDb. It offers plenty of slap stick fun for the kids on a rainy afternoon it is great entertainment. Our kids are 6 and 4 and love it, and most kids under 10 seem to enjoy it very much. As a grown up I would rather watch this than something like Pixars Up! I have to admit to finding Home Alone 1 and 2 somewhat annoying and consider this film to be better on many levels. Sure there isn't much about it that makes it stand out (like a real plot or any character development) but it gets on with it pretty early in the film (1 and 2 burble on for an hour before anything really happens) and Alex is really likable in the lead in a way Culkin could never be If you haven't seen it give it a go, you wont be disappointed
