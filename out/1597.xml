    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

    There is so much good stuff going on in this one. The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

    There is so much good stuff going on in this one. The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

    There is so much good stuff going on in this one. The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

    A truly original and inventive film, rated R for it's heavy use of violence that looks very real for a change. Incredibly on this video cover, the violence reference is not mentioned. Crowe's performance here was the one that catapulted him to stardom, where as far as I'm concerned, this is still his best performance here. It's a pity they don't have Oscar awards in Oz, cause he'd win it hands down, as Hando, the unrelenting leader of a pack of skinheads, their hate for asians, reaching beyond what anyone could fathom. We don't learn much about their reasons for disliking the Vietnamese, and that's a good thing, cause if more was said as to why, the film would lose it's substance and ferocity. Every performance in this movie is excellent. Daniel Pollock, John Brumpton, and Jacqueline Mckenzie, a desperate junkie and a victim of incest, (pity that bloody Deep Blue Sea, put a stale period on her career) are all flawless. More here so, is Mckenzie, so believable when having a seizure, even I got concerned, even though I knew it was just acting. From the word get go, this movie takes on a no holds barred ride into a nightmare territory of boundless hate. The skinheads, even question the barman, at their favorite watering hole as to why he lets gooks in there. Later on at the same bar, the barman goes off with an Asian guy, who's gonna take over the business, leaving his two sons to mind the place. How could this barman be so reckless. When learning of this, the skins can't get away fast enough and the two races go war to war. The skins, totally outnumbered, realizing they've overstepped their mark, flee, and take refuge in a warehouse, occupied by one of the skin's girl's ex's. The dialogue that transpires, between the girl conning her way back into this building, is actually a humorous relief, in the wake of the intense ten minute battle between the two races, that passed where some real nasty blood was shed, some of the most realistic use of blood, I've seen. I liked the direction this movie took from here. It almost made me take up using Campbell's sauce again. The sex scene with Crowe doing Mckenzie behind, both naked, was titilating too, almost necessary, putting a light, though not romantic moment to this film. Some of the potent dialogue, here too, is interesting. So is Crowe's extensive tattooed work on his back. I'm almost prepared to believe Crowe won't be able to surpass himself here with a better performance, than in this bold and confrontational film, that I can't believe I first saw over twenty years ago. The way the cops interacted with the skins, granting no mercy, when capturing them, sounded all so true, almost a replica of that exact same scene happening for real. The movie does lose a little of it's fizz near the end, when it comes down to our three players, one skin who doesn't walk away, the other hopefully walking away from all of this futile hate bulls..t for good.

    A group of skinheads become alarmed at the way their neighborhood is changing. So this was Russell Crowe's breakout performance? Being a tough guy who beats people up? Sounds about right, at least as far as his image is generally concerned. I do not have much to say about this one. It lies on a plane somewhere between "A Clockwork Orange" and "American History X", with the racism turned against the Vietnamese rather than African-Americans. I know nothing about racial tension in Australia, so I cannot comment on this aspect -- I did not know they had a Neo-Nazi movement, even a small one.

    One of the better Australian movies to emanate from the 90's stars Russell Crowe before home-wrecking, hotel telephones and Oscars as an aggressive skinhead (Hando) whose relationship with best friend Daniel Pollock (Davy) sours over the ever-escalating brand of racism he practices, and the presence of Jacqueline Mackenzie's character with whom both are involved - Crowe's neglect paves the way for Pollock's advances and so the rivalry emerges. Apart from Crowe (who is essentially monotone in-character) and Mackenzie as a misguided rich kid rebelling in the extreme, only Sam Wyllie is recognisable as one of the motley crew. Though Pollock could have potentially become a recognisable actor, tragically his life ended prematurely shortly following this film. Generally, like a great many Australian pictures, "Romper Stomper" is edgy and raw, and the content of the film is fairly uncompromising in its violent and sometimes graphic detail (read nudity). This all bodes well if you're comfortable with the subject matter as you shouldn't be disappointed.

    There is so much good stuff going on in this one. The look of the film: It's gritty, and while you can tell it was lower-budget, the film reeks of quality in terms of the shots/overall cinematography. 16mm really did nothing but add to the realism of this one. The story:It's chock-full of interesting characters. Some good. SOme evil. And some that want to go from one side to the other, but can't. The sound: Amazing. The music is powerful. Especially in the final scene where the music will stay with you for long after the credits end. The acting: First rate across the board. These people could have been real for all I know. This film will divide audiences because of it's subject matter, but it's one of the best, lesser-known, low-budget foreign offerings you're likely to see. The current 6.8 rating is an absolute travesty. I was expecting to see about 7.8, and that's why I decided to write this review. This is a disturbing film, and one that I can highly recommend. It IS better than American History X. 86/100 You Might Like THis if you Liked: American History X(good, but not as good), THe Boys Next Door(perhaps the last time a low-budget, dramatic film disturbed me this much - not as good as this though), American Me(not quite as good as this), Boyz in the Hood(better), Tzameti 13(not as good).

    Before he became the big star, the New Zealand born Australian raised actor had varied parts in just a few films, and later he would get the bigger role in The Quick and the Dead, then the lead in L.A. Confidential, and of course the Oscar for Leading Actor in Gladiator, so it was interesting for me to see one of his earliest leading roles, from director Geoffrey Wright (Cherry Falls). Basically a gang of violent neo-Nazi skinheads from Footscray, Victoria, Australia, led by Hando (Russell Crowe), with his friend Davey (Daniel Pollock) as second in command, are not afraid to express their racism by attacking anyone of the Asian community. Gabrielle 'Gabe' (Jacqueline McKenzie) joins them, not after being beaten up by her drug-taking boyfriend, who was hired to do the beating by her sexually abusive and rich father Martin (Alex Scott), and she and Hando form a close blond. The gang are joined soon by friends visiting from Canberra, and they find out their local pub has been sold to a Vietnamese Australian businessman, so they go and attack the owner's sons, and in the situation one of the Vietnamese youth phones for help from fellow community members. They outnumber the skinheads and surround their rented warehouse, but they manage to escape the chaos as the community break in and ransack and set fire to the place, so the skinheads retreat to another warehouse that has squatters. Hando convinces his fellow gang members that they should get revenge against the Vietnamese, starting with the purchase of a gun, and Gabe's suggestion is to burgle her father's mansion, as payback for the years of abuse, she also tells Davey she plans to get away with Hando from the violent lifestyle. Davey has doubts about his current lifestyle and leave the gang, and the same time Gabe dumps Hando, the two of them spend the night together, and she informs the police where the gang is, and the gang are hoarded by police, with the youngest skinhead shot dead, and the rest arrested. Hando was not there at the time though, and even though he does catch Gabe and Davey in bed together, he wants to convince his friend to stick by him, and he does, so they all go on the run, robbing a service station, and the leader strangling the Asian store owner to death. They stop on a beach, and the two male friends have a conversation where there is an argument about the girl, she meanwhile sets fire to the car and admits to them that she called the police. This enrages Hando and he chases her, trying to kill by drowning her in the sea, but Davey stabs him in the back of the neck with a knife, he dies, and Gabe and Davey hug together, while a bus load of Japanese tourists watch from above. Also starring Leigh Russell as Sonny Jim, Dan Wyllie as Cackles, James McKenna as Bubs, Eric Mueck as Champ and Frank Magree as Brett. Crowe gives a great performance as the leader of the gang, he is suitably the most unhinged of the characters, and the support of Pollock and Scott is terrific as well, the raiding of the warehouse is the most engaging scene, but many moments of disturbing exploits of skinhead violence and abuse get you gripped, there are good reasons to put this in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, a good drama. Worth watching!

    The un-stylized, mind-numbing violence makes it a difficult experience, but "Romper Stomper" somehow manages to walk on that thin line between "edgy" and "self-serving". It makes fine observations while not crossing the line, and that's what makes the difference between art and mere exploitation. Enjoyable like a smack over the head, the film basically gives you the horrifying spectacle of humans trying to connect. To fill a void. Through violence. The major asset of "Romper Stomper" is a young Russell Crowe who already dominates the space with tremendous star power. If he's not perfectly "credible" in this role it's only because, despite his tattoos and menacing physique, he simply looks too intelligent, too complex for a Skin-head. A real Skin-Head, as I imagine it, would be nothing more than a brain-dead, inarticulate brute, with no intellect whatsoever. Russell's clear voice and eyes can't help but blowing his "cover". But this is no dumb reality-show, and the choosing of Crowe is a wise one. We are watching here more than mindless violence - there is something going on in these characters' minds after all. And it is interesting to get a glimpse. He's the leader, so he has some degree of intelligence; the rest are cattle. Nobody but Russell Crowe could represent an idea so convincingly: the fascination of violence. By the end of the movie, I was left with the impression that these people were just a bunch of confused kids who hadn't been fortunate enough to have better role-models. Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!

    You liked Heath Ledgers Joker, then you might also be scared shitless by Russel Crowes flawless performance as the main antagonist in this outstanding story about hate. I mean just look at him. Just the simple way he moves and stares at the others and his sudden rage attacks. Damn what a performance. The film itself is really enjoyable/entertaining. This film crosses many lines, with its realistic, harsh tone. It sucks you right into its atmosphere, which can be really depressing in some parts as it does its job so well. And thats good for a film like that. the only bad thing about ROMPER STOMPER is the kind of boring second half. Surely its not a bad second half, it just feels so empty, but well nothing is perfect. I wouldn't recommend this film for educational reasons. If you are a teacher and you wanna teach your students about racism you better stick with American History X as the moral seams to be a little bit more focused on the subject. But anyways, check it out.

    This hit the headlines in Britain when upon its initial release in London the Anti-Nazi League picketed cinemas showing it because ... well it gives that lot something to do . The fact that there's something inversely fascist in this by screaming " Fascist " or " Nazi " at someone doing something rabidly oppressive such as paying money to watch a film is lost on some people . At least London allowed the film to be shown unlike a few councils in Britain such as Glasgow city council who outright banned the film from being shown in cinema chains in the city . I'm guessing the thinking behind this is down to it being used as a recruiting campaign for far right groups ? Remind me what scene in this film promotes fascism in any way ? Now that the ill founded controversy has died down ROMPER STOMPER is the film best known for a power house breakthrough performance by Russell Crowe who at the turn of the century was quite possibly the best known movie star in the world . It wasn't just his acting he was known for and would often make headlines being a little too free with his fists and seeing Crowe in this movie all those years ago led me to ask if Crowe wasn't using too much acting skill as a violent thug . As good as Crowe is it's the performance of Jacqueline McKenzie and the late Daniel Pollock that probably stand the test of time Despite the memorable performances ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty and unconvincing movie . It tries to be a gritty realist film but its constant use of an Oi soundtrack negates this . The production team didn't want to pay royalties to Neo-Nazi bands such as Skewdriver so that's two fingers up to both the Nazis and the anti-Nazis so congratulations to the production team for that . But the storytelling is a bit confusing it's got elements of a doomed love triangle but is in no way a twisted love story . Indeed the characters are difficult to buy in to and give the impression they're mere plot devices there to build up a story and have their world collapse around them as things go wrong . Perhaps this is why I thought the film tries to make a point of family and belonging but everything ends up becoming so confused that it's difficult to see what the point the film is trying to make . It's a good film in parts and you'll remember certain scenes such as the " fourth Reich fighting men " chase but at the end of the day ROMPER STOMPER is a rather empty film

    It is a strong warning film about violence and its fatal consequences - no matter what the reason is, who much this need is justified etc. Youth violence has its roots often in the childhood, which is clearly visible in this film as well. And if we add problems with relatives, unemployment, shabby lifestyle/opportunities, gangs formed on the basis of ethnicity - it is all like a sparkle lit. Romper Stromper runs rather smoothly has includes very intense scenes well captured by cameramen: the big scuffle between skinheads and Vietnamese youngsters is presumably the highlight of this film. And the cast is evenly strong, leading with Russell Crowe as Hando, but Daniel Pollock as Davey and Jacqueline McKenzie as Gabrielle provide great performances as well. The soundtrack has also a big role in the film's success - raw songs with anti-immigrant slogans give additional tense and vigor. Not a family film, but worth watching. Even for Russell Crowe's sake.

Violent as they were, they seemed to be craving, deep down, for something else  for a family, for love and friendship. The way it plays out certainly leaves room for more open questions on "nature vs nurture". However, the film doesn't make excuses for the gang's behavior. On the contrary, it presents them as a dying species, their ideology rendered obsolete by natural evolution. The movie only tries to identify the causes of this aberration. As I see it, the ending comes as both an affirmation of faith and a much needed moral position. It's good, seeing a filmmaker take responsibility for a change. The director could have easily turned Hando into a tragic hero, wronged by society and only taking what's rightfully his. Fortunately, that doesn't happen. Great acting and direction, well developed and intriguing characters, compelling social commentary and above all, Russell Crowe's take on a difficult role, make "Romper Stomper" an interesting exploration of the mind.

    Spectacular, seductive, powerful and impressive. A beautiful script and an extraordinary cast. Russel Crowe in one of most remarkable creation. A magnificent show, with taste of lost era, with strong recipes and joy of play. A film about mirror of life. Art, love, seduction and cruel games as ingredients of a cake with a very intelligent flavor in which cinnamon an pepper, hot chili and cream are ingredients. A chocolate cake. For mind and for the chance to find a intelligent story about the basic things of street fighting and every competition. "All about Eve" and Shakespeare comedies in same package.So, must see it!
