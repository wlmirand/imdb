    My name is Carlie Dougher. I was in this movie. The little baby on the porch, frank's daughter in the movie. I was wondering if I made a comment if maybe I would be put in the cast. I mean the "kid on swing" was. Haha :) Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines I mine as well give a review. I was 14 when I was finally able to watch this movie due to the violence and it being rated R. My parents finally allowed me to watch the full film not just the beginning where I'm in it for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end.

    Judgement Night is directed by Stephen Hopkins and adapted to screenplay by Lewis Colick from a story he co-wrote with Jere Cunningham. It stars Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Denis Leary. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Peter Levy. Two brothers and two pals set out for a blokey night out at a boxing match but take an ill fated short cut and end up on the run from a vicious gang. 93 was a very good year for the action movie fan, with double Stallone, Van Damme teaming up with Woo, an Arnie picture, a Bruce Lee homage, a fugitive Ford, dinosaur frenzy and some minor pulse raisers that garnered a small but loyal following. Judgement Night falls into the last category, it's pretty light on plotting and sensible scripting, but none the less contains a ream of action set-pieces that whilst not exactly brilliantly constructed, they still have impact and entertain the action faithful. Suffice to say, it's not hard to see why it was frowned upon by the critics, it is basically an excuse to string a bunch of drama sequences around a thin narrative that sees the protagonists do the all too usual dumb action movie staples. That's disappointing given that writer Colick was behind the hugely enjoyable Unlawful Entry. The acting is decent enough from the four "on the run" actors, though Piven and Gooding are mightily guilty of gurning for the camera, but everybody falls into Leary's shadow. Leary is having a great time playing the main villain, ice cold stare and caustic delivery in place, he nails it as a bad ass and becomes the main reason to seek the film out for a viewing. Elsewhere, Hopkins's (Predator 2) direction is formulaic, but he does have a good eye for scene staging, with two sequences set at a rail line and a derelict building proving to be visual niceties. Levy's photography is interesting as regards the colour lenses, looks like he used gel saturation to get a high yellow and brown return, which is an odd choice for the urban night terror story. Surely steely cold compositions would have been better? Silvestri's score is basically his one composed for Predator, literally it is the same only with some extensions tacked on. It's a brilliant score, but you just can't help thinking about Arnie and the Dreadlocked Alien and that is something that doesn't help Judgement Night at all. A decent time waster for the action fan, especially if you dig Leary, but outside of those boxes it's pretty standard stuff. 6/10

    The plot: A group of yuppies get stuck in the bad part of town, become witnesses to a murder, and are relentlessly hunted down by a gangster who doesn't want any witnesses. Judgment Night is the sort of stereotypical, clich&eacute;d 1990s thriller that was quite popular: gritty, urban, dark, and starring a young, recognizable cast that seemed well on their way to the A-list. Ironically, few of them managed to retain their popularity for much longer. At the time, I remember being a big fan of pretty much everyone in this movie, though. I've always thought this movie was somewhat underrated, but I can understand why some people dislike it. It's not an incredibly original story, the protagonists are sometimes stupid (and usually annoying), and it apparently takes some liberties with the setting. Not being a Chicago native, I can't really comment on that, but it seems to be a sore point for some. Much like After Hours and Very Bad Things, this is a movie that relishes the opportunity to continually push its protagonists into increasingly nasty situations. However, unlike those movies, it's pretty much a straight-up thriller, without the black humor. I'd recommend this movie to fans of gritty, urban thrillers. It's nothing they haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable rehash, nonetheless.

    What an amazing cast with all the potential to make this a memorable flick. Peter Green in particular is fabulously sinister, but was sadly under-exploited by a country mile - what a pity. Denis Leary as usual delivered perfection and what a complete disaster this movie would have been without him. It started kinda OK and then slowly slid downhill all the way. The overall plot had potential, but it failed to hit the mark: far, far too many unlikely scenarios and too many loose ends. By the time we reached the ending it was obvious the screenwriter/director had run out of ideas. What a shame. I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

    Firstly, no, Im not usually keen to see movies remade, and hate that there is a constant flow of classics being rehashed for no reason. This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there. What I enjoyed about the set up is where the party bus gets stuck in the mother of all traffic jams, eight lanes in both directions completely at a standstill, and the characters have enough time get into a road rage incident and then have a leisurely chat afterwards before getting back on the bus and cruising onwards. The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.

The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there. What I enjoyed about the set up is where the party bus gets stuck in the mother of all traffic jams, eight lanes in both directions completely at a standstill, and the characters have enough time get into a road rage incident and then have a leisurely chat afterwards before getting back on the bus and cruising onwards. The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.

    My name is Carlie Dougher. I was in this movie. The little baby on the porch, frank's daughter in the movie. I was wondering if I made a comment if maybe I would be put in the cast. I mean the "kid on swing" was. Haha :) Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines I mine as well give a review. I was 14 when I was finally able to watch this movie due to the violence and it being rated R. My parents finally allowed me to watch the full film not just the beginning where I'm in it for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end.

    Judgement Night is directed by Stephen Hopkins and adapted to screenplay by Lewis Colick from a story he co-wrote with Jere Cunningham. It stars Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Denis Leary. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Peter Levy. Two brothers and two pals set out for a blokey night out at a boxing match but take an ill fated short cut and end up on the run from a vicious gang. 93 was a very good year for the action movie fan, with double Stallone, Van Damme teaming up with Woo, an Arnie picture, a Bruce Lee homage, a fugitive Ford, dinosaur frenzy and some minor pulse raisers that garnered a small but loyal following. Judgement Night falls into the last category, it's pretty light on plotting and sensible scripting, but none the less contains a ream of action set-pieces that whilst not exactly brilliantly constructed, they still have impact and entertain the action faithful. Suffice to say, it's not hard to see why it was frowned upon by the critics, it is basically an excuse to string a bunch of drama sequences around a thin narrative that sees the protagonists do the all too usual dumb action movie staples. That's disappointing given that writer Colick was behind the hugely enjoyable Unlawful Entry. The acting is decent enough from the four "on the run" actors, though Piven and Gooding are mightily guilty of gurning for the camera, but everybody falls into Leary's shadow. Leary is having a great time playing the main villain, ice cold stare and caustic delivery in place, he nails it as a bad ass and becomes the main reason to seek the film out for a viewing. Elsewhere, Hopkins's (Predator 2) direction is formulaic, but he does have a good eye for scene staging, with two sequences set at a rail line and a derelict building proving to be visual niceties. Levy's photography is interesting as regards the colour lenses, looks like he used gel saturation to get a high yellow and brown return, which is an odd choice for the urban night terror story. Surely steely cold compositions would have been better? Silvestri's score is basically his one composed for Predator, literally it is the same only with some extensions tacked on. It's a brilliant score, but you just can't help thinking about Arnie and the Dreadlocked Alien and that is something that doesn't help Judgement Night at all. A decent time waster for the action fan, especially if you dig Leary, but outside of those boxes it's pretty standard stuff. 6/10

    The plot: A group of yuppies get stuck in the bad part of town, become witnesses to a murder, and are relentlessly hunted down by a gangster who doesn't want any witnesses. Judgment Night is the sort of stereotypical, clich&eacute;d 1990s thriller that was quite popular: gritty, urban, dark, and starring a young, recognizable cast that seemed well on their way to the A-list. Ironically, few of them managed to retain their popularity for much longer. At the time, I remember being a big fan of pretty much everyone in this movie, though. I've always thought this movie was somewhat underrated, but I can understand why some people dislike it. It's not an incredibly original story, the protagonists are sometimes stupid (and usually annoying), and it apparently takes some liberties with the setting. Not being a Chicago native, I can't really comment on that, but it seems to be a sore point for some. Much like After Hours and Very Bad Things, this is a movie that relishes the opportunity to continually push its protagonists into increasingly nasty situations. However, unlike those movies, it's pretty much a straight-up thriller, without the black humor. I'd recommend this movie to fans of gritty, urban thrillers. It's nothing they haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable rehash, nonetheless.

    What an amazing cast with all the potential to make this a memorable flick. Peter Green in particular is fabulously sinister, but was sadly under-exploited by a country mile - what a pity. Denis Leary as usual delivered perfection and what a complete disaster this movie would have been without him. It started kinda OK and then slowly slid downhill all the way. The overall plot had potential, but it failed to hit the mark: far, far too many unlikely scenarios and too many loose ends. By the time we reached the ending it was obvious the screenwriter/director had run out of ideas. What a shame. I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

    Firstly, no, Im not usually keen to see movies remade, and hate that there is a constant flow of classics being rehashed for no reason. This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy.

The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.

    My name is Carlie Dougher. I was in this movie. The little baby on the porch, frank's daughter in the movie. I was wondering if I made a comment if maybe I would be put in the cast. I mean the "kid on swing" was. Haha :) Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines I mine as well give a review. I was 14 when I was finally able to watch this movie due to the violence and it being rated R. My parents finally allowed me to watch the full film not just the beginning where I'm in it for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end.

    Judgement Night is directed by Stephen Hopkins and adapted to screenplay by Lewis Colick from a story he co-wrote with Jere Cunningham. It stars Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Denis Leary. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Peter Levy. Two brothers and two pals set out for a blokey night out at a boxing match but take an ill fated short cut and end up on the run from a vicious gang. 93 was a very good year for the action movie fan, with double Stallone, Van Damme teaming up with Woo, an Arnie picture, a Bruce Lee homage, a fugitive Ford, dinosaur frenzy and some minor pulse raisers that garnered a small but loyal following. Judgement Night falls into the last category, it's pretty light on plotting and sensible scripting, but none the less contains a ream of action set-pieces that whilst not exactly brilliantly constructed, they still have impact and entertain the action faithful. Suffice to say, it's not hard to see why it was frowned upon by the critics, it is basically an excuse to string a bunch of drama sequences around a thin narrative that sees the protagonists do the all too usual dumb action movie staples. That's disappointing given that writer Colick was behind the hugely enjoyable Unlawful Entry. The acting is decent enough from the four "on the run" actors, though Piven and Gooding are mightily guilty of gurning for the camera, but everybody falls into Leary's shadow. Leary is having a great time playing the main villain, ice cold stare and caustic delivery in place, he nails it as a bad ass and becomes the main reason to seek the film out for a viewing. Elsewhere, Hopkins's (Predator 2) direction is formulaic, but he does have a good eye for scene staging, with two sequences set at a rail line and a derelict building proving to be visual niceties. Levy's photography is interesting as regards the colour lenses, looks like he used gel saturation to get a high yellow and brown return, which is an odd choice for the urban night terror story. Surely steely cold compositions would have been better? Silvestri's score is basically his one composed for Predator, literally it is the same only with some extensions tacked on. It's a brilliant score, but you just can't help thinking about Arnie and the Dreadlocked Alien and that is something that doesn't help Judgement Night at all. A decent time waster for the action fan, especially if you dig Leary, but outside of those boxes it's pretty standard stuff. 6/10

    The plot: A group of yuppies get stuck in the bad part of town, become witnesses to a murder, and are relentlessly hunted down by a gangster who doesn't want any witnesses. Judgment Night is the sort of stereotypical, clich&eacute;d 1990s thriller that was quite popular: gritty, urban, dark, and starring a young, recognizable cast that seemed well on their way to the A-list. Ironically, few of them managed to retain their popularity for much longer. At the time, I remember being a big fan of pretty much everyone in this movie, though. I've always thought this movie was somewhat underrated, but I can understand why some people dislike it. It's not an incredibly original story, the protagonists are sometimes stupid (and usually annoying), and it apparently takes some liberties with the setting. Not being a Chicago native, I can't really comment on that, but it seems to be a sore point for some. Much like After Hours and Very Bad Things, this is a movie that relishes the opportunity to continually push its protagonists into increasingly nasty situations. However, unlike those movies, it's pretty much a straight-up thriller, without the black humor. I'd recommend this movie to fans of gritty, urban thrillers. It's nothing they haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable rehash, nonetheless.

    What an amazing cast with all the potential to make this a memorable flick. Peter Green in particular is fabulously sinister, but was sadly under-exploited by a country mile - what a pity. Denis Leary as usual delivered perfection and what a complete disaster this movie would have been without him. It started kinda OK and then slowly slid downhill all the way. The overall plot had potential, but it failed to hit the mark: far, far too many unlikely scenarios and too many loose ends. By the time we reached the ending it was obvious the screenwriter/director had run out of ideas. What a shame. I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

    Firstly, no, Im not usually keen to see movies remade, and hate that there is a constant flow of classics being rehashed for no reason. This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there. What I enjoyed about the set up is where the party bus gets stuck in the mother of all traffic jams, eight lanes in both directions completely at a standstill, and the characters have enough time get into a road rage incident and then have a leisurely chat afterwards before getting back on the bus and cruising onwards. The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven.

This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there. What I enjoyed about the set up is where the party bus gets stuck in the mother of all traffic jams, eight lanes in both directions completely at a standstill, and the characters have enough time get into a road rage incident and then have a leisurely chat afterwards before getting back on the bus and cruising onwards. The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.

    My name is Carlie Dougher. I was in this movie. The little baby on the porch, frank's daughter in the movie. I was wondering if I made a comment if maybe I would be put in the cast. I mean the "kid on swing" was. Haha :) Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines I mine as well give a review. I was 14 when I was finally able to watch this movie due to the violence and it being rated R. My parents finally allowed me to watch the full film not just the beginning where I'm in it for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end.

    Judgement Night is directed by Stephen Hopkins and adapted to screenplay by Lewis Colick from a story he co-wrote with Jere Cunningham. It stars Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Denis Leary. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Peter Levy. Two brothers and two pals set out for a blokey night out at a boxing match but take an ill fated short cut and end up on the run from a vicious gang. 93 was a very good year for the action movie fan, with double Stallone, Van Damme teaming up with Woo, an Arnie picture, a Bruce Lee homage, a fugitive Ford, dinosaur frenzy and some minor pulse raisers that garnered a small but loyal following. Judgement Night falls into the last category, it's pretty light on plotting and sensible scripting, but none the less contains a ream of action set-pieces that whilst not exactly brilliantly constructed, they still have impact and entertain the action faithful. Suffice to say, it's not hard to see why it was frowned upon by the critics, it is basically an excuse to string a bunch of drama sequences around a thin narrative that sees the protagonists do the all too usual dumb action movie staples. That's disappointing given that writer Colick was behind the hugely enjoyable Unlawful Entry. The acting is decent enough from the four "on the run" actors, though Piven and Gooding are mightily guilty of gurning for the camera, but everybody falls into Leary's shadow. Leary is having a great time playing the main villain, ice cold stare and caustic delivery in place, he nails it as a bad ass and becomes the main reason to seek the film out for a viewing. Elsewhere, Hopkins's (Predator 2) direction is formulaic, but he does have a good eye for scene staging, with two sequences set at a rail line and a derelict building proving to be visual niceties. Levy's photography is interesting as regards the colour lenses, looks like he used gel saturation to get a high yellow and brown return, which is an odd choice for the urban night terror story. Surely steely cold compositions would have been better? Silvestri's score is basically his one composed for Predator, literally it is the same only with some extensions tacked on. It's a brilliant score, but you just can't help thinking about Arnie and the Dreadlocked Alien and that is something that doesn't help Judgement Night at all. A decent time waster for the action fan, especially if you dig Leary, but outside of those boxes it's pretty standard stuff. 6/10

    The plot: A group of yuppies get stuck in the bad part of town, become witnesses to a murder, and are relentlessly hunted down by a gangster who doesn't want any witnesses. Judgment Night is the sort of stereotypical, clich&eacute;d 1990s thriller that was quite popular: gritty, urban, dark, and starring a young, recognizable cast that seemed well on their way to the A-list. Ironically, few of them managed to retain their popularity for much longer. At the time, I remember being a big fan of pretty much everyone in this movie, though. I've always thought this movie was somewhat underrated, but I can understand why some people dislike it. It's not an incredibly original story, the protagonists are sometimes stupid (and usually annoying), and it apparently takes some liberties with the setting. Not being a Chicago native, I can't really comment on that, but it seems to be a sore point for some. Much like After Hours and Very Bad Things, this is a movie that relishes the opportunity to continually push its protagonists into increasingly nasty situations. However, unlike those movies, it's pretty much a straight-up thriller, without the black humor. I'd recommend this movie to fans of gritty, urban thrillers. It's nothing they haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable rehash, nonetheless.

    What an amazing cast with all the potential to make this a memorable flick. Peter Green in particular is fabulously sinister, but was sadly under-exploited by a country mile - what a pity. Denis Leary as usual delivered perfection and what a complete disaster this movie would have been without him. It started kinda OK and then slowly slid downhill all the way. The overall plot had potential, but it failed to hit the mark: far, far too many unlikely scenarios and too many loose ends. By the time we reached the ending it was obvious the screenwriter/director had run out of ideas. What a shame. I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.

    My name is Carlie Dougher. I was in this movie. The little baby on the porch, frank's daughter in the movie. I was wondering if I made a comment if maybe I would be put in the cast. I mean the "kid on swing" was. Haha :) Since I must write a minimum of 10 lines I mine as well give a review. I was 14 when I was finally able to watch this movie due to the violence and it being rated R. My parents finally allowed me to watch the full film not just the beginning where I'm in it for a good 3 minutes or so lol. Iv watched it so many times and show all my friends it's such a cool movie and it never gets old not to mention is funny as hell and it's definitely a nail biter. It's a good movie on a rainy days. It's one of those movies you wont want to end.

    Judgement Night is directed by Stephen Hopkins and adapted to screenplay by Lewis Colick from a story he co-wrote with Jere Cunningham. It stars Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr., Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Denis Leary. Music is scored by Alan Silvestri and cinematography by Peter Levy. Two brothers and two pals set out for a blokey night out at a boxing match but take an ill fated short cut and end up on the run from a vicious gang. 93 was a very good year for the action movie fan, with double Stallone, Van Damme teaming up with Woo, an Arnie picture, a Bruce Lee homage, a fugitive Ford, dinosaur frenzy and some minor pulse raisers that garnered a small but loyal following. Judgement Night falls into the last category, it's pretty light on plotting and sensible scripting, but none the less contains a ream of action set-pieces that whilst not exactly brilliantly constructed, they still have impact and entertain the action faithful. Suffice to say, it's not hard to see why it was frowned upon by the critics, it is basically an excuse to string a bunch of drama sequences around a thin narrative that sees the protagonists do the all too usual dumb action movie staples. That's disappointing given that writer Colick was behind the hugely enjoyable Unlawful Entry. The acting is decent enough from the four "on the run" actors, though Piven and Gooding are mightily guilty of gurning for the camera, but everybody falls into Leary's shadow. Leary is having a great time playing the main villain, ice cold stare and caustic delivery in place, he nails it as a bad ass and becomes the main reason to seek the film out for a viewing. Elsewhere, Hopkins's (Predator 2) direction is formulaic, but he does have a good eye for scene staging, with two sequences set at a rail line and a derelict building proving to be visual niceties. Levy's photography is interesting as regards the colour lenses, looks like he used gel saturation to get a high yellow and brown return, which is an odd choice for the urban night terror story. Surely steely cold compositions would have been better? Silvestri's score is basically his one composed for Predator, literally it is the same only with some extensions tacked on. It's a brilliant score, but you just can't help thinking about Arnie and the Dreadlocked Alien and that is something that doesn't help Judgement Night at all. A decent time waster for the action fan, especially if you dig Leary, but outside of those boxes it's pretty standard stuff. 6/10

    The plot: A group of yuppies get stuck in the bad part of town, become witnesses to a murder, and are relentlessly hunted down by a gangster who doesn't want any witnesses. Judgment Night is the sort of stereotypical, clich&eacute;d 1990s thriller that was quite popular: gritty, urban, dark, and starring a young, recognizable cast that seemed well on their way to the A-list. Ironically, few of them managed to retain their popularity for much longer. At the time, I remember being a big fan of pretty much everyone in this movie, though. I've always thought this movie was somewhat underrated, but I can understand why some people dislike it. It's not an incredibly original story, the protagonists are sometimes stupid (and usually annoying), and it apparently takes some liberties with the setting. Not being a Chicago native, I can't really comment on that, but it seems to be a sore point for some. Much like After Hours and Very Bad Things, this is a movie that relishes the opportunity to continually push its protagonists into increasingly nasty situations. However, unlike those movies, it's pretty much a straight-up thriller, without the black humor. I'd recommend this movie to fans of gritty, urban thrillers. It's nothing they haven't seen before, but it's an enjoyable rehash, nonetheless.

    What an amazing cast with all the potential to make this a memorable flick. Peter Green in particular is fabulously sinister, but was sadly under-exploited by a country mile - what a pity. Denis Leary as usual delivered perfection and what a complete disaster this movie would have been without him. It started kinda OK and then slowly slid downhill all the way. The overall plot had potential, but it failed to hit the mark: far, far too many unlikely scenarios and too many loose ends. By the time we reached the ending it was obvious the screenwriter/director had run out of ideas. What a shame. I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

    Firstly, no, Im not usually keen to see movies remade, and hate that there is a constant flow of classics being rehashed for no reason. This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there.

I like my movies to be believable, I don't like shouting at the characters to do what they should/would be doing if this wasn't the movies. Too often, the chance to build tension and suspense was lost with the urge to inject quirky humor. Perhaps it's worth the watch in the hope that it might not be as poor as I claim, but you can forget any ideas of a second glance.

    Firstly, no, Im not usually keen to see movies remade, and hate that there is a constant flow of classics being rehashed for no reason. This film is an exception, because, lets face it, you can hardly call it a classic. I always get really surprised when someone else I speak to has actually seen it, or can remember it. Personally, I blooming love it. Not sure why to be honest, the dialogue is pretty clich&eacute;d, and the 'good guy' group of mates aren't given any real back story to make you care much about them. All the characters are all paper thin, and let's be honest, I can not for one second buy Emilio Estevez as a tough guy. Crazy ol Billy the kid yeah, but a bad @ss? Not quite. Im not saying that I don't like his performance, because I do. I think that 'because' of it's flaws, this film has stayed with me, and is one of those guilty pleasure movies I always find myself revisiting. However, I think this movie has the real potential to be looked at again. The cat and mouse story is nothing new, but, I really liked the idea of setting the story in a city, where we should feel safe, as opposed to the wilderness, or some abandoned old farm. I like it's tight timeframe, setting the story over one night. I love Denis Leary's 'Fallon' a legitimately chilling bad guy. I would love to see a director with a real visual identity re boot this movie and make use of todays financial melt down in the UK. Set the film in one of London's grimy council estates. I think it would be awesome, if not at all original.

    Alan Silvestri's score. There's the high point of this movie. "Judgment Night" is a rather poorly made action thriller set on the mean streets of urban Chicago. Four guys from the suburbs climb aboard a fully loaded RV and head to the big boxing match. But a wrong turn (tip: don't let Jeremy Piven drive) takes them from the clogged artery of the expressway onto the seedy streets where even the police won't visit. You know the landscape: trash can fires, newspapers and old coffee cups blowing in the wind, and boarded up tenements as far as the eye can see. Our hapless heroes bear witness to a grisly murder at the hands of Fallon (Denis Leary), a ruthless bad guy who ... well we don't know what his line of work is, but he likes to shoot people. And Fallon doesn't like witnesses, either. You can see where it goes from here. This is a movie with no socially redeeming value. It might make for a suspenseful thrill-ride at the movies if it weren't for the clunky pacing and action that unfurls in fits and starts. The acting also leaves a lot to be desired, but then there's not a whole lot of depth to these characters. What begins as a good-natured evening among immature adults turns into a series of dumb decisions, infighting and the lots of yelling. Things continue to go from bad to worse, and there's no good reason to want these characters to get away. Halfway through the film, it just seems like one group is destined to run, and the other is destined to stalk. No point really emerges to these characters' actions. But Silvestri (in the interest of bringing this writeup full-circle) really ratchets the tension with a superb score. Unfortunately, it's everyone else keeping this thing from taking off. 4.5/10

    Four snobby guys from a nice, wholesome neighbourhood taking a wrong turn and being chased by a gang of psychopathic street punks led by (of all people) Denis Leary, how I miss the times when movies were this simple. Anyone can come up with a simple plot, but to have an effective simple plot is much harder to achieve. The casting of the characters is pretty perfect as well, Jeremy Piven's character is so totally over the top that there's almost a sick joy is hoping for his death, and the villains look about as vile as human beings can look. Director Stephen Hopkins appears to be re-using the highly atmospheric urban settings he already put in "Predator 2", they actually seem to work even better here. I mean, this is a really ugly-looking movie, kudos on that. Apart maybe from the ending, which is rather generic, this is a very creative and riveting B-movie.

    Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Dennis Leary, Stephen Dorff, Jeremy Piven and Michael DeLorenzo all turn in fantastic roles in a very underrated film. Coming from the suburbs of Chicago the group of friends get off a freeway to try to bypass traffic so they could get to a boxing match in time. Little do they know that by doing so their lives would forever change. This is one of those movies where you ask yourself "why wasn't this a huge hit?" Looking at the other films out at the time I can't say there was a blockbuster that really got in the way unless if you count Demolition Man as a blockbuster. I remember seeing a behind-the-scenes look (on Entertainment Tonight) at a rooftop stunt that amazed me. Even though the Entertainment Tonight clip didn't show great angles the stunt was impressive and looked much better in the film itself. Outside of the Young Gun movies, Men At Work and Stakeout this is one of my all-time favorite Emilio Estevez films. Despite the other stars this is truly his film and he gives a great performance. Cuba Gooding helps add to the heart and soul of the film. Both Gooding and Estevez pull out all the stops and giving their roles much more depth than they could possibly have had in the script. Dennis Leary plays a great villain that is believable given some of the outrageous circumstances. The film has it all for action-thriller-adventure fans. I highly recommend it. All I can say is the film probably lacked in the promotional department because I can't see why anyone would not like it!

    Judgment Night makes me feel more open about choosing action films. I've neglected some action films, but seeing the great cast this one had I couldn't resist. Emilio Estevez has been on my list of favorite actors since I saw him in The Mighty Ducks at age nine at YMCA camp. This film makes him even more honorable. I don't believe I've seen a bad film with any of these actors in it. All gave 100% in this film. The film is about Frank, Ray, Mike, and John (Estevez, Piven, Gooding, and Dorff) who are traveling to a boxing match in Chicago. This is their first big get together since their one friend Frank got married. To avoid traffic, the boys take a back route and end up in a bad part of Chicago. They find a guy fatally injured on the road and take him into their RV. A gang leader named Fallon (Leary) smashed a window in their car, takes the man, and kills him. The rest of the film is a deadly cat and mouse game that gets severely intense and rarely lets up. The film has exhilarating sound, a fabulous cast, and an intense soundtrack. Dennis Leary is great as a cut-throat gang leader as he almost comes off as a Joe Pesci kind of guy. Emilio Estevez is great to see again, and Jeremy Piven and Cuba Gooding Jr. do not disappoint as well. Judgment Night is a lot like Joy Ride. It's a movie that can only be truly appreciated once. The first time I saw Joy Ride, I can't lie, I was legitimately scared. I jumped at a few scenes, and really was scared to find out what happens next. Same goes with Judgment Night, both do their job to scare the audience or make them jump. They both fulfill their duty as thrillers. The downside to this is because their films with big surprise scenes, as well as chase scenes, their true scare level comes with the first viewing. With repeated viewings I can believe this film goes down in quality much like Joy Ride did. Both are still well made thrillers, as a matter of fact Joy Ride is in my favorite film list, but even that loses it's scare after a while. Many movies will make you jump after viewing them. The original Friday the 13th, Halloween, and A Nightmare on Elm Street still make me jump in quite a few parts. But Judgment Night and Joy Ride have surprises that are only effective once. Still, Judgment Night passes in every category it was neglected in back when it released in 1993. It still serves today as an underrated action piece. Starring: Emilio Estevez, Cuba Gooding Jr, Jeremy Piven, Stephen Dorff, and Denis Leary. Directed by: Stephen Hopkins.

    There's a reason many 15 year old films are hard to find - they ain't that good.

    How cutting edge is this!?! I am reviewing a 16 year old film that sold approximately zero tickets starring a bunch of guys that would probably be happier if this wasn't on their resume. The plot itself is quite a basic formula, a bunch of old friends plan a dude's night out to a boxing match, but as they are running late they take a shortcut through what the media would call an "urban area" and things don't go according to plan from there. What I enjoyed about the set up is where the party bus gets stuck in the mother of all traffic jams, eight lanes in both directions completely at a standstill, and the characters have enough time get into a road rage incident and then have a leisurely chat afterwards before getting back on the bus and cruising onwards. The four characters: Frank  Former hellraiser turned family man. (Emilio Estevez in between Mighty Ducks movies.) John - Frank's younger brother. Impetuous and quick tempered. (Stephen Dorff trying to look menacing and edgy, while remaining pretty.) Mike  Cool guy, bit of a ladies' man. (Cuba Gooding Jr pre Oscar and his subsequent career tailspin. I though an Oscar improved your career?) Ray  The quick talking dodgy mate. Unreliable and more bluster and bravado than bravery. (Jeremy Piven with wayyyy more hair than he has now.) Everyone has a Ray mate, the guy that talks a great game and has the most amazing adventures when no-one he knows is around. They're amusing enough to have around as long as you understand that you can never truly rely on them and that they will sell you out in a heartbeat if it benefits them even a little. The key to co-existing with a Ray is knowing in advance that from time to time you will feel the urge to mutilate them with something, but being smart enough to ignore their repeated and expected transgressions. Or cut them off and move on with new friends. It's your call but make it early to avoid going insane. Probably related to the above paragraph. I hate Jeremy Piven. I just find him annoying and terribly overrated. In my opinion he is just another actor who struck lucky with one role (Entourage) and rode the wave long enough that people just accepted him. Half an hour in, enter Denis Leary as Fallon, but I'll call him Denis because that's who he is no matter what role he plays, and because he is a bit of an "Asshole" (his song, not mine) he is better suited to the role of the bad guy or anti hero. This is why he is great in this (and especially "The Ref"). It's a double standard, but you whinge when an actor plays the same role over and over and never tests them self by branching out, others like Denis should stick to what they know. Anyway Denis's first act is to kill someone in the middle of the road, under a streetlight, after a discussion, knowing full well that he is being watched. Sounds a bit dumb doesn't it? but as the plot doesn't advance sometimes without dumb stuff happening let's move on. Want more dumb? How about the fact that Denis and gang go door to door trying to find the guys, without masks and toting guns? The last hour has a lot of running and chasing, which Denis the famed smoker must have enjoyed. The guys hide, then run, then hide, then run, with Denis walking around talking loudly and demanding they hand themselves over. One dialogue scene between the gang plays exactly like a music video and stands out primarily for how different it is to the rest of the film. It's a pretty run of the mill action pic, and would be OK only as a late night brain-turned-off flick. Would have benefited from being say 10 or 15 minutes shorter as run/hide/run/hide gets old quick and when none of the characters are especially likable it doesn't matter which order they die in. There isn't much of anything that stands out aside from Denis as Fallon, the violence is paint by numbers, the laughs rare and the death scenes boringly predictable and not that inventive. If this doesn't sound much like a recommendation it is because it really isn't. The soundtrack on the other hand is 50% great, 50% filler. I have owned it since this movie was released and drag it out every now and then, as long as you fast forward judiciously there are three absolute classic tracks to be found in collaborations between House of Pain/Helmet, Faith No More/Boo-Ya Tribe and De La Soul/Teenage Fanclub. Final Rating  6.5 /10. Not particularly bad, but there is a reason that a lot of 15 year old films are hard to find on DVD, they just aren't particularly good.
