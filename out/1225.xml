 <sinopse>
  A miserable fat teenager secretly has a crush on the class beauty, ends up becoming the surprising participant to dance with her at a high school dance, meaning he's got to get his act together with the help of his best friend.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Angus is a large, pathetic 14 year old whose thoughts are most often filled with the image of one Melissa Lefevre. Angus is shy and thinks that he has no chance of ever 'getting' her. Being especially uncool, he is incredibly surprised (along with the rest of the school) that he is chosen to dance with her at the Winter Ball. The only one not surprised is the cool-kid who set him up to fail, but Angus' best friend is going to help him win the heart of Melissa by developing a new look for him.

    Angus (1995) *** (out of 4) Charming gem about an overweight teenager named Angus (Charlie Talbert) who is constantly being tormented by the kids at his school. This eventually leads to him being the target of a prank that gets him elected homecoming king where he's going to have to dance with the Queen, which just happens to be the girl of his dreams (Ariana Richards). Through all of this Angus has his grandfather (George C. Scott) and mother (Kathy Bates) there trying to do what's best for him. ANGUS is a truly charming little gem and it's really too bad that it never found a bigger audience because it's really a good little movie. Of course it's going to have a big message going throughout but what really makes this film work are the performances and the relationship that Charlie has with the people around him. The main focus is the relationship between Charlie and his grandfather with this here getting some of the most heartwarming scenes in the picture. Talbert is excellent in his role as the abused teen as he really has a lot of passion in the performance and I think it's fair to say that he perfectly handles the emotional challenges of the role. Bates is also good in her supporting bit as is James Van Der Beek and Richards. The real scene stealer is George C. Scott who is just so tender and fun here as the advice giving grandfather. The film certainly borrows some from CARRIE but this here is just played for laughs and its message. The film isn't a masterpiece but for its type it's very charming and fun to watch.

    Great soundtrack, great actors, terrible movie. How did these great, established actors get duped into this terrible, obvious and worn out script? I graduated in 1993 and let me tell you, this was no example of what high schools were like during that time. Im sure there were schools this movie might relate to but for the most part all the macho-jocks were gone by 1990, a few stragglers aside. The 70s and part of the 80s were horrible because these kinds of school bullying situations were still going on but by the 90s they were 98% dead. I've COME TO REALIZE THAT TEEN MOVIES ARE MADE BY DIRECTORS WHO ARE USUALLY 10 YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND A TEEN MOVIE IS MADE BY SOMEONE WHO WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 10 YEARS BEFORE AND IDENTIFIES WITH SITUATIONS THAT ARE USUALLY NOT AS RELIVANT NOW AND THEY USED TO BE. My kids envy what me and my wife got to do in middle and high school. Not to mention the fun relationship we had with our teachers. Now, principals and teachers are so terrified of getting sued they cannot make friends with their students and school days absolutely miserable. The whole "bullying" thing has gotten so ridiculous and overblown that underclassmen don't interact or even "see" 7th or 8th graders during the day, after school or even on the bus. My son got suspended for 2 days for stopping to drink water on his way to class after getting off the bus in the 7th grade hall when he was a 6th grader. I couldn't help but think; who's the bully? The kids or the teachers? Don't even get me started on the CRCT, which is more about teachers keeping their jobs versus kids not getting "left behind". Sorry, Ill get back to the movie. Bottom line is this is a "periodic" movie that doesn't even relate to kids in the time period it was made. If you liked "SHES ALL THAT" (UGH!)than you probably will like this movie. Its just a little sad that after my kids watched this movie I had to have a talk with them stating that although I was the quarterback, starting pitcher and small forward for my high school teams, this movie was in no way the way I, or anyone else I knew at my school or any other schools in my county ( I lived in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The fastest growing county in the world 3 or the 4 years I attended high school) acted as "jocks" in high school. But then again, as much fun as the 90s were, they really started a trend of over-reacting that has ruined school for this generation.

    I was surfing around and was immediately sucked in by this film. By the time it was over, I was pumped to have stumbled on to it. Angus Bethune is such an easy character to like and to pull for. I loved how, at the climax of the film, they way Angus stands up for himself isn't really what we wanted to see, but it turns out to be even better. His mom and grandpa are great, and their dinner table banter is awesome. The way the two of them support Angus in their own ways really works out for him well in the end. Van Der Beek is great as the high school villain. I haven't seen a ton of his work--most of what I've seen has been his self-effacing Internet stuff, so I find him to be a likable guy. It is a testament to his acting ability, then, that he was able to portray such an unsavory character so early in his career. I love the way that Angus' secret crush, Melissa, was treated. We see a lot of her, but don't hear a thing from her for most of the film. We make assumptions about her based upon her standing at school, and when she finally opens her mouth, we are proved wrong. The flag pole scene is such an apt depiction of an embarrassing adolescent moment--we get glimpses of what it looks like through Angus' eyes, and just when you think it couldn't possibly get any worse, holy ****! We've all had moments like that. All in all, this was just a fun movie with a great message. "Screw 'em!" Easy to say, tough to do. The world would be a much better place if we were all better at doing it.

    This is not a masterpiece but for people who are different, abnormal or rejects from society because of what they look like or how react, this movie can change a life for the better! It did for me. Since I watched this movie, I decided that I will try to reach for my dreams...That I will go even if people (who are mean) try to stop me or discourage me... Until I found "My Moment" like he says in the movie. This movie inspired me and today and I try to do the same around me. Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...") The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park. The emotions are so real and I tell people to watch the movie if they want to understand what I've been thru... and I'm sure that It will do the same to many more. Whenever I need a cheer, I watch the movie again!

    I couldn't remember the title to this movie at first, but I remember the plum tux as plain as day. As a few other people have written and I'll re-iterate, why does Hollywood mis-label movies so much? Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'? Although there is some comic relief ( as in life - there also is ), this is not what I would call a comedy. This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed. It is the best case for anti-bullying efforts in school that I have ever seen. So why the "bleeping bleep" is this NOT on DVD? Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year, here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are "first timers" in school would buy. This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mis-labeled in the name of sales and won't be the last - but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ? My kids would watch this in a heartbeat !!! Hey - anyone at Disney listening ??? Snap this film up while it's cheap and re-release it. Guaranteed money maker every year. The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is "Sleepover" - while I like that one too, it's not anywhere near as real as this. 10 out of 10 for the movie, ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.

    I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.

    A memorable movie for the wrong reasons. The first time I watched "Angus" I thought : "what a great movie! it will be among my favorites!". Now, every time it airs on cable I try to avoid it. But don't get me wrong, I avoid it not because it's a boring or bad movie, it's that it provokes me mixed feelings. There are many comedic moments that suddenly crash with dramatic situations that could make anyone cry. I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations. Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied, betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend, and then loses the most important person in his life : his grand father. Now, this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying, death, loneliness, etc. Recommended.

    Misguided, unfunny film adapted from the short story by Chris Crutcher concerning an overweight high school boy who struggles to gain respect from his peers. Eventually he's invited to the school dance, but it may be just a prank at Angus' expense. Sloppy direction from Patrick Read Johnson sinks a decent supporting cast (including Kathy Bates and Chris Owen), and George C. Scott has a completely routine role as grandfather to Angus (his scenes look as if they were shot all in one day). This kind of cafeteria-comedy manages to tickle some, but the script is wholly uninspired and unoriginal, and the results are crudely obvious instead of interesting. * from ****

    Of all things, in my freshman year of high school this movie came out and I was stunned. It was about a guy whose own life mirrored my own I just got up and applauded (literally) through the whole thing. Angus was me in school, right down to his geeky friend/sidekick. I was a different kind of person from the rest of the crowd. I was big, and smart, kept to myself mostly but that was so I didn't get into trouble. The biggest difference? I have Tourrette's Syndrome, and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out. It was nice to see that people like me could be shown on the big screen in so positive a way. So of course I had to write a review on it here. The movie is about a fat kid, who like me was good at science and fair at football (though I truly despise football, thanks Coach!) who has a single mom and lives with his grandfather, both played marvelously by Cathy Bates and George C. Scott. Angus wants to get with the popular chick, who just happens to be dating his arch-rival in school that has suffered numerous broken noses over the years from Angus' wrath. You grow to love his grandad who gives him advice on how its OK to be different, to just "Screw 'em!" If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was, then Angus is your movie. And his mom, once more like me, seems to be one of the only people who truly ever understand him. Top it all off with his big science project to be able to attend the Magnet School in town, and you've got something spectacular! Add the soundtrack for extra points and I give it a 10 out of 10! "Go for it Angus!" God, I love that line!

    Most people who've seen this film agree that it's an overlooked classic in the teen angst genre. I'm not a fan of after-school-type movies, but this one is far from it. Everything comes together so well -- the writing, the acting, the soundtrack -- that it easily holds its own against darker angst-ridden films like the Breakfast Club or Donnie Darko. It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clich&eacute; problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy. Similar to Pretty in Pink, but better because I think there's better chemistry between the actors. It amazes me this movie is not on DVD, but I'm guessing it will be someday. If you have a VCR and can get a copy, check it out. Any movie that features Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You" at the high school dance can't be all that bad.

    Of all things, in my freshman year of high school this movie came out and I was stunned. It was about a guy whose own life mirrored my own I just got up and applauded (literally) through the whole thing. Angus was me in school, right down to his geeky friend/sidekick. I was a different kind of person from the rest of the crowd. I was big, and smart, kept to myself mostly but that was so I didn't get into trouble. The biggest difference? I have Tourrette's Syndrome, and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out. It was nice to see that people like me could be shown on the big screen in so positive a way. So of course I had to write a review on it here. The movie is about a fat kid, who like me was good at science and fair at football (though I truly despise football, thanks Coach!) who has a single mom and lives with his grandfather, both played marvelously by Cathy Bates and George C. Scott. Angus wants to get with the popular chick, who just happens to be dating his arch-rival in school that has suffered numerous broken noses over the years from Angus' wrath. You grow to love his grandad who gives him advice on how its OK to be different, to just "Screw 'em!" If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was, then Angus is your movie. And his mom, once more like me, seems to be one of the only people who truly ever understand him. Top it all off with his big science project to be able to attend the Magnet School in town, and you've got something spectacular! Add the soundtrack for extra points and I give it a 10 out of 10! "Go for it Angus!" God, I love that line!

    Most people who've seen this film agree that it's an overlooked classic in the teen angst genre. I'm not a fan of after-school-type movies, but this one is far from it. Everything comes together so well -- the writing, the acting, the soundtrack -- that it easily holds its own against darker angst-ridden films like the Breakfast Club or Donnie Darko. It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clich&eacute; problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy. Similar to Pretty in Pink, but better because I think there's better chemistry between the actors. It amazes me this movie is not on DVD, but I'm guessing it will be someday. If you have a VCR and can get a copy, check it out. Any movie that features Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You" at the high school dance can't be all that bad.

    Angus (1995) *** (out of 4) Charming gem about an overweight teenager named Angus (Charlie Talbert) who is constantly being tormented by the kids at his school. This eventually leads to him being the target of a prank that gets him elected homecoming king where he's going to have to dance with the Queen, which just happens to be the girl of his dreams (Ariana Richards). Through all of this Angus has his grandfather (George C. Scott) and mother (Kathy Bates) there trying to do what's best for him. ANGUS is a truly charming little gem and it's really too bad that it never found a bigger audience because it's really a good little movie. Of course it's going to have a big message going throughout but what really makes this film work are the performances and the relationship that Charlie has with the people around him. The main focus is the relationship between Charlie and his grandfather with this here getting some of the most heartwarming scenes in the picture. Talbert is excellent in his role as the abused teen as he really has a lot of passion in the performance and I think it's fair to say that he perfectly handles the emotional challenges of the role. Bates is also good in her supporting bit as is James Van Der Beek and Richards. The real scene stealer is George C. Scott who is just so tender and fun here as the advice giving grandfather. The film certainly borrows some from CARRIE but this here is just played for laughs and its message. The film isn't a masterpiece but for its type it's very charming and fun to watch.

    Great soundtrack, great actors, terrible movie. How did these great, established actors get duped into this terrible, obvious and worn out script? I graduated in 1993 and let me tell you, this was no example of what high schools were like during that time. Im sure there were schools this movie might relate to but for the most part all the macho-jocks were gone by 1990, a few stragglers aside. The 70s and part of the 80s were horrible because these kinds of school bullying situations were still going on but by the 90s they were 98% dead. I've COME TO REALIZE THAT TEEN MOVIES ARE MADE BY DIRECTORS WHO ARE USUALLY 10 YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND A TEEN MOVIE IS MADE BY SOMEONE WHO WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 10 YEARS BEFORE AND IDENTIFIES WITH SITUATIONS THAT ARE USUALLY NOT AS RELIVANT NOW AND THEY USED TO BE. My kids envy what me and my wife got to do in middle and high school. Not to mention the fun relationship we had with our teachers. Now, principals and teachers are so terrified of getting sued they cannot make friends with their students and school days absolutely miserable. The whole "bullying" thing has gotten so ridiculous and overblown that underclassmen don't interact or even "see" 7th or 8th graders during the day, after school or even on the bus. My son got suspended for 2 days for stopping to drink water on his way to class after getting off the bus in the 7th grade hall when he was a 6th grader. I couldn't help but think; who's the bully? The kids or the teachers? Don't even get me started on the CRCT, which is more about teachers keeping their jobs versus kids not getting "left behind". Sorry, Ill get back to the movie. Bottom line is this is a "periodic" movie that doesn't even relate to kids in the time period it was made. If you liked "SHES ALL THAT" (UGH!)than you probably will like this movie. Its just a little sad that after my kids watched this movie I had to have a talk with them stating that although I was the quarterback, starting pitcher and small forward for my high school teams, this movie was in no way the way I, or anyone else I knew at my school or any other schools in my county ( I lived in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The fastest growing county in the world 3 or the 4 years I attended high school) acted as "jocks" in high school. But then again, as much fun as the 90s were, they really started a trend of over-reacting that has ruined school for this generation.

    I was surfing around and was immediately sucked in by this film. By the time it was over, I was pumped to have stumbled on to it. Angus Bethune is such an easy character to like and to pull for. I loved how, at the climax of the film, they way Angus stands up for himself isn't really what we wanted to see, but it turns out to be even better. His mom and grandpa are great, and their dinner table banter is awesome. The way the two of them support Angus in their own ways really works out for him well in the end. Van Der Beek is great as the high school villain. I haven't seen a ton of his work--most of what I've seen has been his self-effacing Internet stuff, so I find him to be a likable guy. It is a testament to his acting ability, then, that he was able to portray such an unsavory character so early in his career. I love the way that Angus' secret crush, Melissa, was treated. We see a lot of her, but don't hear a thing from her for most of the film. We make assumptions about her based upon her standing at school, and when she finally opens her mouth, we are proved wrong. The flag pole scene is such an apt depiction of an embarrassing adolescent moment--we get glimpses of what it looks like through Angus' eyes, and just when you think it couldn't possibly get any worse, holy ****! We've all had moments like that. All in all, this was just a fun movie with a great message. "Screw 'em!" Easy to say, tough to do. The world would be a much better place if we were all better at doing it.

    This is not a masterpiece but for people who are different, abnormal or rejects from society because of what they look like or how react, this movie can change a life for the better! It did for me. Since I watched this movie, I decided that I will try to reach for my dreams...That I will go even if people (who are mean) try to stop me or discourage me... Until I found "My Moment" like he says in the movie. This movie inspired me and today and I try to do the same around me. Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...") The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park. The emotions are so real and I tell people to watch the movie if they want to understand what I've been thru... and I'm sure that It will do the same to many more. Whenever I need a cheer, I watch the movie again!

    I couldn't remember the title to this movie at first, but I remember the plum tux as plain as day. As a few other people have written and I'll re-iterate, why does Hollywood mis-label movies so much? Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'? Although there is some comic relief ( as in life - there also is ), this is not what I would call a comedy. This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed. It is the best case for anti-bullying efforts in school that I have ever seen. So why the "bleeping bleep" is this NOT on DVD? Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year, here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are "first timers" in school would buy. This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mis-labeled in the name of sales and won't be the last - but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ? My kids would watch this in a heartbeat !!! Hey - anyone at Disney listening ??? Snap this film up while it's cheap and re-release it. Guaranteed money maker every year. The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is "Sleepover" - while I like that one too, it's not anywhere near as real as this. 10 out of 10 for the movie, ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.

    I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.

    A memorable movie for the wrong reasons. The first time I watched "Angus" I thought : "what a great movie! it will be among my favorites!". Now, every time it airs on cable I try to avoid it. But don't get me wrong, I avoid it not because it's a boring or bad movie, it's that it provokes me mixed feelings. There are many comedic moments that suddenly crash with dramatic situations that could make anyone cry. I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations. Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied, betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend, and then loses the most important person in his life : his grand father. Now, this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying, death, loneliness, etc. Recommended.

    Misguided, unfunny film adapted from the short story by Chris Crutcher concerning an overweight high school boy who struggles to gain respect from his peers. Eventually he's invited to the school dance, but it may be just a prank at Angus' expense. Sloppy direction from Patrick Read Johnson sinks a decent supporting cast (including Kathy Bates and Chris Owen), and George C. Scott has a completely routine role as grandfather to Angus (his scenes look as if they were shot all in one day). This kind of cafeteria-comedy manages to tickle some, but the script is wholly uninspired and unoriginal, and the results are crudely obvious instead of interesting. * from ****

Scott has a completely routine role as grandfather to Angus (his scenes look as if they were shot all in one day). This kind of cafeteria-comedy manages to tickle some, but the script is wholly uninspired and unoriginal, and the results are crudely obvious instead of interesting. * from ****

    Of all things, in my freshman year of high school this movie came out and I was stunned. It was about a guy whose own life mirrored my own I just got up and applauded (literally) through the whole thing. Angus was me in school, right down to his geeky friend/sidekick. I was a different kind of person from the rest of the crowd. I was big, and smart, kept to myself mostly but that was so I didn't get into trouble. The biggest difference? I have Tourrette's Syndrome, and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out. It was nice to see that people like me could be shown on the big screen in so positive a way. So of course I had to write a review on it here. The movie is about a fat kid, who like me was good at science and fair at football (though I truly despise football, thanks Coach!) who has a single mom and lives with his grandfather, both played marvelously by Cathy Bates and George C. Scott. Angus wants to get with the popular chick, who just happens to be dating his arch-rival in school that has suffered numerous broken noses over the years from Angus' wrath. You grow to love his grandad who gives him advice on how its OK to be different, to just "Screw 'em!" If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was, then Angus is your movie. And his mom, once more like me, seems to be one of the only people who truly ever understand him. Top it all off with his big science project to be able to attend the Magnet School in town, and you've got something spectacular! Add the soundtrack for extra points and I give it a 10 out of 10! "Go for it Angus!" God, I love that line!

    Most people who've seen this film agree that it's an overlooked classic in the teen angst genre. I'm not a fan of after-school-type movies, but this one is far from it. Everything comes together so well -- the writing, the acting, the soundtrack -- that it easily holds its own against darker angst-ridden films like the Breakfast Club or Donnie Darko. It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clich&eacute; problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy. Similar to Pretty in Pink, but better because I think there's better chemistry between the actors. It amazes me this movie is not on DVD, but I'm guessing it will be someday. If you have a VCR and can get a copy, check it out. Any movie that features Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You" at the high school dance can't be all that bad.

    Angus (1995) *** (out of 4) Charming gem about an overweight teenager named Angus (Charlie Talbert) who is constantly being tormented by the kids at his school. This eventually leads to him being the target of a prank that gets him elected homecoming king where he's going to have to dance with the Queen, which just happens to be the girl of his dreams (Ariana Richards). Through all of this Angus has his grandfather (George C. Scott) and mother (Kathy Bates) there trying to do what's best for him. ANGUS is a truly charming little gem and it's really too bad that it never found a bigger audience because it's really a good little movie. Of course it's going to have a big message going throughout but what really makes this film work are the performances and the relationship that Charlie has with the people around him. The main focus is the relationship between Charlie and his grandfather with this here getting some of the most heartwarming scenes in the picture. Talbert is excellent in his role as the abused teen as he really has a lot of passion in the performance and I think it's fair to say that he perfectly handles the emotional challenges of the role. Bates is also good in her supporting bit as is James Van Der Beek and Richards. The real scene stealer is George C. Scott who is just so tender and fun here as the advice giving grandfather. The film certainly borrows some from CARRIE but this here is just played for laughs and its message. The film isn't a masterpiece but for its type it's very charming and fun to watch.

    Great soundtrack, great actors, terrible movie. How did these great, established actors get duped into this terrible, obvious and worn out script? I graduated in 1993 and let me tell you, this was no example of what high schools were like during that time. Im sure there were schools this movie might relate to but for the most part all the macho-jocks were gone by 1990, a few stragglers aside. The 70s and part of the 80s were horrible because these kinds of school bullying situations were still going on but by the 90s they were 98% dead. I've COME TO REALIZE THAT TEEN MOVIES ARE MADE BY DIRECTORS WHO ARE USUALLY 10 YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL. SO ALWAYS KEEP IN MIND A TEEN MOVIE IS MADE BY SOMEONE WHO WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL 10 YEARS BEFORE AND IDENTIFIES WITH SITUATIONS THAT ARE USUALLY NOT AS RELIVANT NOW AND THEY USED TO BE. My kids envy what me and my wife got to do in middle and high school. Not to mention the fun relationship we had with our teachers. Now, principals and teachers are so terrified of getting sued they cannot make friends with their students and school days absolutely miserable. The whole "bullying" thing has gotten so ridiculous and overblown that underclassmen don't interact or even "see" 7th or 8th graders during the day, after school or even on the bus. My son got suspended for 2 days for stopping to drink water on his way to class after getting off the bus in the 7th grade hall when he was a 6th grader. I couldn't help but think; who's the bully? The kids or the teachers? Don't even get me started on the CRCT, which is more about teachers keeping their jobs versus kids not getting "left behind". Sorry, Ill get back to the movie. Bottom line is this is a "periodic" movie that doesn't even relate to kids in the time period it was made. If you liked "SHES ALL THAT" (UGH!)than you probably will like this movie. Its just a little sad that after my kids watched this movie I had to have a talk with them stating that although I was the quarterback, starting pitcher and small forward for my high school teams, this movie was in no way the way I, or anyone else I knew at my school or any other schools in my county ( I lived in Gwinnett County, Georgia. The fastest growing county in the world 3 or the 4 years I attended high school) acted as "jocks" in high school. But then again, as much fun as the 90s were, they really started a trend of over-reacting that has ruined school for this generation.

    I was surfing around and was immediately sucked in by this film. By the time it was over, I was pumped to have stumbled on to it. Angus Bethune is such an easy character to like and to pull for. I loved how, at the climax of the film, they way Angus stands up for himself isn't really what we wanted to see, but it turns out to be even better. His mom and grandpa are great, and their dinner table banter is awesome. The way the two of them support Angus in their own ways really works out for him well in the end. Van Der Beek is great as the high school villain. I haven't seen a ton of his work--most of what I've seen has been his self-effacing Internet stuff, so I find him to be a likable guy. It is a testament to his acting ability, then, that he was able to portray such an unsavory character so early in his career. I love the way that Angus' secret crush, Melissa, was treated. We see a lot of her, but don't hear a thing from her for most of the film. We make assumptions about her based upon her standing at school, and when she finally opens her mouth, we are proved wrong. The flag pole scene is such an apt depiction of an embarrassing adolescent moment--we get glimpses of what it looks like through Angus' eyes, and just when you think it couldn't possibly get any worse, holy ****! We've all had moments like that. All in all, this was just a fun movie with a great message. "Screw 'em!" Easy to say, tough to do. The world would be a much better place if we were all better at doing it.

    This is not a masterpiece but for people who are different, abnormal or rejects from society because of what they look like or how react, this movie can change a life for the better! It did for me. Since I watched this movie, I decided that I will try to reach for my dreams...That I will go even if people (who are mean) try to stop me or discourage me... Until I found "My Moment" like he says in the movie. This movie inspired me and today and I try to do the same around me. Another part of the movie made me realize that we (the not normal people), are braver than those who have it all because we have to face adversity ("Superman is not brave because he is invincible... you're not...") The music is excellent (most of it by Green Day), especially after his grand-father's death in the park. The emotions are so real and I tell people to watch the movie if they want to understand what I've been thru... and I'm sure that It will do the same to many more. Whenever I need a cheer, I watch the movie again!

    I couldn't remember the title to this movie at first, but I remember the plum tux as plain as day. As a few other people have written and I'll re-iterate, why does Hollywood mis-label movies so much? Are they as insecure as Angus when it comes to picking a genre'? Although there is some comic relief ( as in life - there also is ), this is not what I would call a comedy. This movie should be shown in every single school district in this country when bullying is being discussed. It is the best case for anti-bullying efforts in school that I have ever seen. So why the "bleeping bleep" is this NOT on DVD? Considering all the TRASH that Hollywood puts out every year, here you have a golden gem that would make a ton of money as more kids who are "first timers" in school would buy. This isn't the first movie that Hollywood has mis-labeled in the name of sales and won't be the last - but for pete sakes PLEASE put this on DVD ? My kids would watch this in a heartbeat !!! Hey - anyone at Disney listening ??? Snap this film up while it's cheap and re-release it. Guaranteed money maker every year. The only other film that I've seen come even CLOSE to showing a kid standing up for themselves is "Sleepover" - while I like that one too, it's not anywhere near as real as this. 10 out of 10 for the movie, ZERO out of 10 for the idiots who haven't gotten it put to DVD yet.

    I really think all teenagers should watch this at the beginning of their high school days.It will make things a lot easier for them due to the message of this film.Its about saying "screw'em" to the world and to just be yourself and that its OK to be abnormal because "there is no normal".Every teenager suffers from Self Esteem problems but after watching this film they should feel a lot more relaxed within themselves.From touching scenes to funny set pieces it has something for most people and will leave you with a nice feeling inside,how many movies do that these days where its all doom and gloom and ridiculous scenarios.This is also a very well acted movie and is lovely piece of work overall.

    A memorable movie for the wrong reasons. The first time I watched "Angus" I thought : "what a great movie! it will be among my favorites!". Now, every time it airs on cable I try to avoid it. But don't get me wrong, I avoid it not because it's a boring or bad movie, it's that it provokes me mixed feelings. There are many comedic moments that suddenly crash with dramatic situations that could make anyone cry. I mean, the warming relationship between Angus and his grandpa is tear jerker (specially before grandpa dies), but then it picks up the teenager situations. Angus is a story about a boy that suffers from being bullied, betrayed by his ONLY geeky friend, and then loses the most important person in his life : his grand father. Now, this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying, death, loneliness, etc. Recommended.

    Misguided, unfunny film adapted from the short story by Chris Crutcher concerning an overweight high school boy who struggles to gain respect from his peers. Eventually he's invited to the school dance, but it may be just a prank at Angus' expense. Sloppy direction from Patrick Read Johnson sinks a decent supporting cast (including Kathy Bates and Chris Owen), and George C. Scott has a completely routine role as grandfather to Angus (his scenes look as if they were shot all in one day). This kind of cafeteria-comedy manages to tickle some, but the script is wholly uninspired and unoriginal, and the results are crudely obvious instead of interesting. * from ****

Now, this is an entertaining movie but it carries some difficult situations like bullying, death, loneliness, etc. Recommended.

    Misguided, unfunny film adapted from the short story by Chris Crutcher concerning an overweight high school boy who struggles to gain respect from his peers. Eventually he's invited to the school dance, but it may be just a prank at Angus' expense. Sloppy direction from Patrick Read Johnson sinks a decent supporting cast (including Kathy Bates and Chris Owen), and George C. Scott has a completely routine role as grandfather to Angus (his scenes look as if they were shot all in one day). This kind of cafeteria-comedy manages to tickle some, but the script is wholly uninspired and unoriginal, and the results are crudely obvious instead of interesting. * from ****

    Of all things, in my freshman year of high school this movie came out and I was stunned. It was about a guy whose own life mirrored my own I just got up and applauded (literally) through the whole thing. Angus was me in school, right down to his geeky friend/sidekick. I was a different kind of person from the rest of the crowd. I was big, and smart, kept to myself mostly but that was so I didn't get into trouble. The biggest difference? I have Tourrette's Syndrome, and was only beginning to show the major ticks associated with it when this movie came out. It was nice to see that people like me could be shown on the big screen in so positive a way. So of course I had to write a review on it here. The movie is about a fat kid, who like me was good at science and fair at football (though I truly despise football, thanks Coach!) who has a single mom and lives with his grandfather, both played marvelously by Cathy Bates and George C. Scott. Angus wants to get with the popular chick, who just happens to be dating his arch-rival in school that has suffered numerous broken noses over the years from Angus' wrath. You grow to love his grandad who gives him advice on how its OK to be different, to just "Screw 'em!" If you're looking for a realistic movie about high school and you were different from the rest of the crowd like I was, then Angus is your movie. And his mom, once more like me, seems to be one of the only people who truly ever understand him. Top it all off with his big science project to be able to attend the Magnet School in town, and you've got something spectacular! Add the soundtrack for extra points and I give it a 10 out of 10! "Go for it Angus!" God, I love that line!

    Most people who've seen this film agree that it's an overlooked classic in the teen angst genre. I'm not a fan of after-school-type movies, but this one is far from it. Everything comes together so well -- the writing, the acting, the soundtrack -- that it easily holds its own against darker angst-ridden films like the Breakfast Club or Donnie Darko. It's not full of four-letter words, sexual exploration, drug abuse, or any of the other clich&eacute; problems of teen life, but rather deals with the more day-to-day high school drama of bullying and crushes in a way that's both more innocent, yet more disturbing because of its accuracy. Similar to Pretty in Pink, but better because I think there's better chemistry between the actors. It amazes me this movie is not on DVD, but I'm guessing it will be someday. If you have a VCR and can get a copy, check it out. Any movie that features Mazzy Star's "Fade Into You" at the high school dance can't be all that bad.
