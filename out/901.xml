    Back in the day, Mr. Magoo was very well popular during his time. The running gag in the cartoon was that Mr. Magoo couldn't see well and always ended up colliding into all kinds of mayhem. As for this film, which is live-action, director Stanley Tong did a good job keeping the realism of the cartoon the same. Mr. Magoo still goes up, down, left and right in this film like he was on an invisible roller coaster. What surprised me the most about this film was that Disney sponsored it. Starring as the infamous Mr. Magoo is Leslie Nielsen. What's neat, is that in beginning you actually get to see the transition from cartoon life into real life. Of course not many people will notice at first, but cartoon Magoo doesn't have hair but when Leslie Nielsen is on screen, he does have hair. Even I didn't notice until much later, so my question remains, who forgot to make this cartoon look as accurate as possible? Its not really a big deal because Disney made the same mistake two years later when Inspector Gadget (1999) was made and they had Dr. Claw right out in the open; oh well. The other thing that's sort of ridiculous about the film are the physics behind certain scenes. Again, this is a cartoon adaptation so things are kept unrealistic but still some scenes come off as being almost impossible. This whole movie is made to look like everyone is idiotic. I must say that it was done well because everyone in this movie are idiots, but they are funny idiots. Nielsen is good at making it look like he knows whom he's talking to even though he doesn't. The two spies played by Ernie Hudson and Stephen Tobolowsky are funny to watch too. They either end up knocking each other over just to see who can get to the finish line first or they end up knocking each other out altogether. Nick Chinlund who plays another doofus named Bob Morgan tries to get his hands on Mr. Magoo. What a wreck that guy was. Miguel Ferrer, from RoboCop (1987), plays the main villain in this film. His character is called Ortega Peru and although he's a mean villain, he doesn't impose himself as a bad guy. I guess that's what you get for being bad guy in a silly Disney comedy. The music is good too; it has a giddy jumpiness to it, which goes well with what Mr. Magoo does in this film. Not every scene will have big laughs but it's a cute, goofy, and fun filled movie for the family. Kids will definitely love it. Disney took a chance and although they failed to impress critics and the majority of Magoo fans, it still has a little charm to it. The movie is silly fun that makes Magoo look like he can handle anything that's placed or thrown in his way, even though he can't which makes it all the more unrealistic for a live-action cartoon.

    Leslie Nielsen is the best thing about 'Mr. Magoo'. Like always, the late legend delivers a spirited & lovable performance, that, truly, translates into this film's biggest merit. 'Mr. Magoo' Synopis: The myopic millionaire defeats jewel smugglers in his usual bumbling manner. As a film, 'Mr. Magoo' is fairly entertaining. Some jokes work, while some aren't really appealing or funny. The Screenplay isn't great, but fair nonetheless. Stanley Tong's Direction, is decent. Cinematography & Editing, are strictly okay. Performance-Wise: Apart from Nielsen, there is no performance in particular that stands out. All the actors abroad apart from Nielsen, lend ordinary to good support. On the whole, 'Mr. Magoo' is a fair entertainer.

    This is far from Leslie Nielson's best movie, that's Airplane or Naked Gun, but Mr Magoo in my opinion is far better than the crap-fest that is 2001:A Space Travesty. As for Mr Magoo, I don't think it was that bad. It was far from perfect, being a little too short and have a story that was on the predictable side. But I do think it is underrated, I thought it was entertaining and fun which is more than I can say for some of the movies I hate, some of which are only a couple of notches higher than this one (ie. Freddy Got Fingered). As for the rating, I do think 3.4 is too low, around the 5.9-6.0 region is more like it. So what did I like about Mr Magoo? Well the fact I was entertained by it helped. The script is amusing, and there are some fun gags, including a hilarious scene in the kitchen. The film does look reasonably good too with good locations and the photography and editing doesn't look as cheap as one might think. The soundtrack is suitably upbeat, the film moves quickly and the direction is pretty decent. And the acting was at least okay too, Nielson was a genius when it came to comedy and while he has been better he does seem to be enjoying himself and Mr Magoo himself is a fun and likable character. Out of the supporting cast, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Ferrer and especially Malcolm McDowell were fun, and Jennifer Garner was okay. All in all, the film is far from perfect but it wasn't bad either. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I am really a huge fan of Mr. Magoo and so when I had heard about this movie, I decided that I was going to see it despite the fact that it really got some bad reviews. But I was not going to let bad reviews affect my judgment, so I went ahead and saw this movie. And when I saw this, I thought that it was really hysterical, in fact, I was in pain from laughing so hard! This film has very big laughs, in my opinion, I was really surprised at how funny this movie was! Mr. Magoo has always been one of my favorite animated characters, because like a lot of many other ones, I really found him funny! This movie is extremely underrated in my opinion, it is not the funniest movie that I have ever seen, but it is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a couple of years! To me, Mr. Magoo is not a terrible movie, it seems that it was just ahead of its time and the world was not ready for it, but despite what a lot of people said, I thought that this movie was a laugh fest, this movie is filled with a lot of laughs, so many laughs, that I was crying with laughter and that at times no sound was coming out! I could just watch this movie over and over again! I thought that Leslie Nielsen was the perfect choice to play Mr. Magoo, well to me, Leslie Nielsen is really a funny guy, and so I guess that is what made him really great for the part! This movie is really a fun time that I would just watch whenever I would be in the mood for something funny, because I think that this film is criminally underrated! Mr. Magoo is a spectacularly funny film, it has got a lot of laughs in it that will leave you in stitches! You will be laughing and laughing out loud when you watch this! Get ready to see a movie that is really hysterical thought really underrated, Mr. Magoo! When you watch this movie, you probably might like it like I did. No wait, I did not like Mr. Magoo, I really loved it! I could just watch this over and over again and laugh even more each time! 10/10

    This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, "Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing. After that, though, its all a complete blank. I think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember ANYTHING from it. I understand that Leslie Nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard," in "Scary Movie 4," and "Police Squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but I came away at least remembering *something*. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank. I find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.

    I remember when I went to this movie with my mom in Germany. I laugh so much watching it ... and like for 10 years I kept it in so good memories. Then came the day when Mr.Magoo was being showed on our TV station in Latvia, I wanted to see it so much ... I even taped it. But when I watched it I was so disappointed. I didn't even smile while watching it. Well what I wanted to say with this, you can't rate this kind of movies like a grownup. It's not a comedy made for us but for the kids, and watching this they won't be disappointed. And the parents won't be disappointed too because they will see their kids smiling and smile with them. Because of the grate memories 10/10.

    Mr Magoo is as wealthy as he is short-sighted and it is this combination that sees him trapped in the museum he is patron of late one night, when a robbery occurs. The CCTV footage makes him look like he was in on it and the FBI/CIA investigation focuses on him as they try to locate a stolen diamond while keeping the robbery on the low-down. Meanwhile, as he fishes, Magoo manages to have the stolen jewel dropped into his fishing box (best not to ask how) and thus is unwittingly pursued by thieves and cops. OK. This is based on a old cartoon character so I tried to ignore the modern PC outrage over this film by disabled groups protesting the depiction of partial blindness. According to IMDb it was this that saw the film sliding into video obscurity however I beg to differ. I was outraged by this film  but not for the reasons of objecting to the fact that it gets laughs out of a disability, but rather the fact that it totally fails to get laughs out of a disability. I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was. The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly "wacky" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance. Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it  for me personally, it wasn't.

    i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site.I'll admit it's no masterpiece,but it is vastly entertaining.to me,Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr.Magoo.if you don't know the character of Mr.Magoo,he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted,leading him into all kinds of trouble,yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on.oh yeah,he is also very wealthy.the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same.he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem.in the movie,Magoo,helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail,with a lot of help,from both his nephew and his dog.yes,i said dog.this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps,both minor and major.Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role.not to mention she is hot,hot,hot.anyway,like i said earlier,the movie is certainly very amusing,and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen.there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves,courtesy of Lynch's character.for the most part,this is a great family movie,with maybe a bit of mild language.for me,the live action version of Mr.Magoo is an 8.5/10,based simply on how entertaining it is.

    Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems like the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here. So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.

    Mr. Magoo is at times silly, and at others, very silly. But always funny. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a late-night movie. But if your looking for a substantial movie with anything serious about it, forget it! This is a movie for when you're staying up way too late and need some good laughs, or any time you need some good laughs for that matter! Larry Nielson is in high form, with marvelous comedy from the supporting cast, a winner in my opinion: don't hesitate to take this one home with you!

I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was. The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly "wacky" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance. Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it  for me personally, it wasn't.

    i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site.I'll admit it's no masterpiece,but it is vastly entertaining.to me,Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr.Magoo.if you don't know the character of Mr.Magoo,he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted,leading him into all kinds of trouble,yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on.oh yeah,he is also very wealthy.the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same.he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem.in the movie,Magoo,helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail,with a lot of help,from both his nephew and his dog.yes,i said dog.this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps,both minor and major.Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role.not to mention she is hot,hot,hot.anyway,like i said earlier,the movie is certainly very amusing,and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen.there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves,courtesy of Lynch's character.for the most part,this is a great family movie,with maybe a bit of mild language.for me,the live action version of Mr.Magoo is an 8.5/10,based simply on how entertaining it is.

    Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems like the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here. So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.

    Mr. Magoo is at times silly, and at others, very silly. But always funny. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a late-night movie. But if your looking for a substantial movie with anything serious about it, forget it! This is a movie for when you're staying up way too late and need some good laughs, or any time you need some good laughs for that matter! Larry Nielson is in high form, with marvelous comedy from the supporting cast, a winner in my opinion: don't hesitate to take this one home with you!

    Back in the day, Mr. Magoo was very well popular during his time. The running gag in the cartoon was that Mr. Magoo couldn't see well and always ended up colliding into all kinds of mayhem. As for this film, which is live-action, director Stanley Tong did a good job keeping the realism of the cartoon the same. Mr. Magoo still goes up, down, left and right in this film like he was on an invisible roller coaster. What surprised me the most about this film was that Disney sponsored it. Starring as the infamous Mr. Magoo is Leslie Nielsen. What's neat, is that in beginning you actually get to see the transition from cartoon life into real life. Of course not many people will notice at first, but cartoon Magoo doesn't have hair but when Leslie Nielsen is on screen, he does have hair. Even I didn't notice until much later, so my question remains, who forgot to make this cartoon look as accurate as possible? Its not really a big deal because Disney made the same mistake two years later when Inspector Gadget (1999) was made and they had Dr. Claw right out in the open; oh well. The other thing that's sort of ridiculous about the film are the physics behind certain scenes. Again, this is a cartoon adaptation so things are kept unrealistic but still some scenes come off as being almost impossible. This whole movie is made to look like everyone is idiotic. I must say that it was done well because everyone in this movie are idiots, but they are funny idiots. Nielsen is good at making it look like he knows whom he's talking to even though he doesn't. The two spies played by Ernie Hudson and Stephen Tobolowsky are funny to watch too. They either end up knocking each other over just to see who can get to the finish line first or they end up knocking each other out altogether. Nick Chinlund who plays another doofus named Bob Morgan tries to get his hands on Mr. Magoo. What a wreck that guy was. Miguel Ferrer, from RoboCop (1987), plays the main villain in this film. His character is called Ortega Peru and although he's a mean villain, he doesn't impose himself as a bad guy. I guess that's what you get for being bad guy in a silly Disney comedy. The music is good too; it has a giddy jumpiness to it, which goes well with what Mr. Magoo does in this film. Not every scene will have big laughs but it's a cute, goofy, and fun filled movie for the family. Kids will definitely love it. Disney took a chance and although they failed to impress critics and the majority of Magoo fans, it still has a little charm to it. The movie is silly fun that makes Magoo look like he can handle anything that's placed or thrown in his way, even though he can't which makes it all the more unrealistic for a live-action cartoon.

    Leslie Nielsen is the best thing about 'Mr. Magoo'. Like always, the late legend delivers a spirited & lovable performance, that, truly, translates into this film's biggest merit. 'Mr. Magoo' Synopis: The myopic millionaire defeats jewel smugglers in his usual bumbling manner. As a film, 'Mr. Magoo' is fairly entertaining. Some jokes work, while some aren't really appealing or funny. The Screenplay isn't great, but fair nonetheless. Stanley Tong's Direction, is decent. Cinematography & Editing, are strictly okay. Performance-Wise: Apart from Nielsen, there is no performance in particular that stands out. All the actors abroad apart from Nielsen, lend ordinary to good support. On the whole, 'Mr. Magoo' is a fair entertainer.

    This is far from Leslie Nielson's best movie, that's Airplane or Naked Gun, but Mr Magoo in my opinion is far better than the crap-fest that is 2001:A Space Travesty. As for Mr Magoo, I don't think it was that bad. It was far from perfect, being a little too short and have a story that was on the predictable side. But I do think it is underrated, I thought it was entertaining and fun which is more than I can say for some of the movies I hate, some of which are only a couple of notches higher than this one (ie. Freddy Got Fingered). As for the rating, I do think 3.4 is too low, around the 5.9-6.0 region is more like it. So what did I like about Mr Magoo? Well the fact I was entertained by it helped. The script is amusing, and there are some fun gags, including a hilarious scene in the kitchen. The film does look reasonably good too with good locations and the photography and editing doesn't look as cheap as one might think. The soundtrack is suitably upbeat, the film moves quickly and the direction is pretty decent. And the acting was at least okay too, Nielson was a genius when it came to comedy and while he has been better he does seem to be enjoying himself and Mr Magoo himself is a fun and likable character. Out of the supporting cast, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Ferrer and especially Malcolm McDowell were fun, and Jennifer Garner was okay. All in all, the film is far from perfect but it wasn't bad either. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I am really a huge fan of Mr. Magoo and so when I had heard about this movie, I decided that I was going to see it despite the fact that it really got some bad reviews. But I was not going to let bad reviews affect my judgment, so I went ahead and saw this movie. And when I saw this, I thought that it was really hysterical, in fact, I was in pain from laughing so hard! This film has very big laughs, in my opinion, I was really surprised at how funny this movie was! Mr. Magoo has always been one of my favorite animated characters, because like a lot of many other ones, I really found him funny! This movie is extremely underrated in my opinion, it is not the funniest movie that I have ever seen, but it is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a couple of years! To me, Mr. Magoo is not a terrible movie, it seems that it was just ahead of its time and the world was not ready for it, but despite what a lot of people said, I thought that this movie was a laugh fest, this movie is filled with a lot of laughs, so many laughs, that I was crying with laughter and that at times no sound was coming out! I could just watch this movie over and over again! I thought that Leslie Nielsen was the perfect choice to play Mr. Magoo, well to me, Leslie Nielsen is really a funny guy, and so I guess that is what made him really great for the part! This movie is really a fun time that I would just watch whenever I would be in the mood for something funny, because I think that this film is criminally underrated! Mr. Magoo is a spectacularly funny film, it has got a lot of laughs in it that will leave you in stitches! You will be laughing and laughing out loud when you watch this! Get ready to see a movie that is really hysterical thought really underrated, Mr. Magoo! When you watch this movie, you probably might like it like I did. No wait, I did not like Mr. Magoo, I really loved it! I could just watch this over and over again and laugh even more each time! 10/10

    This morning, I found myself unexpectedly remembering that this movie existed. I found myself thinking, "Oh yeah, there was a Mr. Magoo movie, wasn't there?" This is more surprising because I remember following the controversy surrounding this movie (advocacy group for the visually impaired said that this movie was demeaning). I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing. After that, though, its all a complete blank. I think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember ANYTHING from it. I understand that Leslie Nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard," in "Scary Movie 4," and "Police Squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but I came away at least remembering *something*. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank. I find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.

    I remember when I went to this movie with my mom in Germany. I laugh so much watching it ... and like for 10 years I kept it in so good memories. Then came the day when Mr.Magoo was being showed on our TV station in Latvia, I wanted to see it so much ... I even taped it. But when I watched it I was so disappointed. I didn't even smile while watching it. Well what I wanted to say with this, you can't rate this kind of movies like a grownup. It's not a comedy made for us but for the kids, and watching this they won't be disappointed. And the parents won't be disappointed too because they will see their kids smiling and smile with them. Because of the grate memories 10/10.

    Mr Magoo is as wealthy as he is short-sighted and it is this combination that sees him trapped in the museum he is patron of late one night, when a robbery occurs. The CCTV footage makes him look like he was in on it and the FBI/CIA investigation focuses on him as they try to locate a stolen diamond while keeping the robbery on the low-down. Meanwhile, as he fishes, Magoo manages to have the stolen jewel dropped into his fishing box (best not to ask how) and thus is unwittingly pursued by thieves and cops. OK. This is based on a old cartoon character so I tried to ignore the modern PC outrage over this film by disabled groups protesting the depiction of partial blindness. According to IMDb it was this that saw the film sliding into video obscurity however I beg to differ. I was outraged by this film  but not for the reasons of objecting to the fact that it gets laughs out of a disability, but rather the fact that it totally fails to get laughs out of a disability. I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was. The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly "wacky" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance. Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it  for me personally, it wasn't.

I even went to see this movie on the day it opened, because I am a fan of both Mr. Magoo, and Mr. Nielson, and thought he would be an excellent choice to play Mr. Magoo. I even remember the opening animated credits, because I thought that they were pretty amusing. After that, though, its all a complete blank. I think its a pretty sad statement about any movie that it is so lame, so bland, and so utterly without merit that you can't remember ANYTHING from it. I understand that Leslie Nielson isn't always known for appearing in first class comedies, but I saw him in "Spy Hard," in "Scary Movie 4," and "Police Squad 3" and none of these were great movies, but I came away at least remembering *something*. Mr. Magoo, though, is a complete blank. I find myself wondering now if all the controversy surrounding the film wasn't actually generated by the studio that produced it, in the hopes of generating at least some small amount of interest in an otherwise totally worthless movie.

    I remember when I went to this movie with my mom in Germany. I laugh so much watching it ... and like for 10 years I kept it in so good memories. Then came the day when Mr.Magoo was being showed on our TV station in Latvia, I wanted to see it so much ... I even taped it. But when I watched it I was so disappointed. I didn't even smile while watching it. Well what I wanted to say with this, you can't rate this kind of movies like a grownup. It's not a comedy made for us but for the kids, and watching this they won't be disappointed. And the parents won't be disappointed too because they will see their kids smiling and smile with them. Because of the grate memories 10/10.

    Mr Magoo is as wealthy as he is short-sighted and it is this combination that sees him trapped in the museum he is patron of late one night, when a robbery occurs. The CCTV footage makes him look like he was in on it and the FBI/CIA investigation focuses on him as they try to locate a stolen diamond while keeping the robbery on the low-down. Meanwhile, as he fishes, Magoo manages to have the stolen jewel dropped into his fishing box (best not to ask how) and thus is unwittingly pursued by thieves and cops. OK. This is based on a old cartoon character so I tried to ignore the modern PC outrage over this film by disabled groups protesting the depiction of partial blindness. According to IMDb it was this that saw the film sliding into video obscurity however I beg to differ. I was outraged by this film  but not for the reasons of objecting to the fact that it gets laughs out of a disability, but rather the fact that it totally fails to get laughs out of a disability. I'd love to pretend to be politically correct and sensitive but there we go! No, the main problem I had with the film is that it is simply not funny. Obviously the gags are all pretty obvious and can be seen coming from miles off but it still surprised me by how lazy it all was. The plot makes no sense but this was perhaps to be expected, however the total delivery is poor. A constantly "wacky" score is forced upon us in a desperate attempt to make us believe that it is hilarious when it is not. Nielsen was a great choice for the lead but even he can do nothing with this rot and in failing to improve it he just becomes part of the problem. The support cast features turns from Garner, Hudson, Tobolowsky, Lynch, Ferrer and McDowell all of whom are either wasted, look embarrassed or both. As director Tong seems to worry that the jokes will surprise his audience and, I assume, fearing injury from split sides, makes sure that we all get a chance to see each and every gag coming from quite a distance. Overall then, a film that will appeal to few audience demographics outside of children and those currently drunk. The jokes are obvious and lazy and all that is left is a terrible plot that (perhaps correctly) assumes the audience has the IQ of a basket and just hopes that a man stumbling around is enough to make it  for me personally, it wasn't.

    i honestly don't understand the low rating this movie has on this site.I'll admit it's no masterpiece,but it is vastly entertaining.to me,Leslie Nielson is perfectly cast as Mr.Magoo.if you don't know the character of Mr.Magoo,he was originally a cartoon character who is absurdly near sighted,leading him into all kinds of trouble,yet he is generally oblivious to most of what's going on.oh yeah,he is also very wealthy.the live action movie portrays the character pretty much exactly the same.he always seems to come out of any potential trouble with virtually no signs of any problem.in the movie,Magoo,helps solve a crime and help put the baddies in jail,with a lot of help,from both his nephew and his dog.yes,i said dog.this dog is is very intelligent and saves Magoo from many mishaps,both minor and major.Kelly Lynch portrays one of the criminals and she does a very fine job in her role.not to mention she is hot,hot,hot.anyway,like i said earlier,the movie is certainly very amusing,and contains an absolutely hysterical sequence with Magoo in the kitchen.there's also some great action and some great martial arts moves,courtesy of Lynch's character.for the most part,this is a great family movie,with maybe a bit of mild language.for me,the live action version of Mr.Magoo is an 8.5/10,based simply on how entertaining it is.

    Leslie Nielsen is usually someone whose movies I really like (even critically panned flicks like "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" and "Wrongfully Accused"). So the fact that I'm slamming "Mr. Magoo" should show that it's a piece of junk. It casts Nielsen as the myopic title character, something gets planted on him, and he makes a mess of everything. It seems like the combo of Nielsen and director Stanley Tong (behind two of Jackie Chan's movies) would make this one hilarious movie, but it doesn't; it seems like they just have people to do anything, and there's no real humor here. So, the original cartoon with Jim Backus providing the voice was worth seeing, so avoid this movie. Leslie Nielsen has also done much better, so there's no reason to waste your time on this. Also starring Kelly Lynch, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ernie Hudson, Malcolm McDowell and Miguel Ferrer; they probably don't wish to emphasize this hunk of junk in their careers.

    Mr. Magoo is at times silly, and at others, very silly. But always funny. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a late-night movie. But if your looking for a substantial movie with anything serious about it, forget it! This is a movie for when you're staying up way too late and need some good laughs, or any time you need some good laughs for that matter! Larry Nielson is in high form, with marvelous comedy from the supporting cast, a winner in my opinion: don't hesitate to take this one home with you!

    Back in the day, Mr. Magoo was very well popular during his time. The running gag in the cartoon was that Mr. Magoo couldn't see well and always ended up colliding into all kinds of mayhem. As for this film, which is live-action, director Stanley Tong did a good job keeping the realism of the cartoon the same. Mr. Magoo still goes up, down, left and right in this film like he was on an invisible roller coaster. What surprised me the most about this film was that Disney sponsored it. Starring as the infamous Mr. Magoo is Leslie Nielsen. What's neat, is that in beginning you actually get to see the transition from cartoon life into real life. Of course not many people will notice at first, but cartoon Magoo doesn't have hair but when Leslie Nielsen is on screen, he does have hair. Even I didn't notice until much later, so my question remains, who forgot to make this cartoon look as accurate as possible? Its not really a big deal because Disney made the same mistake two years later when Inspector Gadget (1999) was made and they had Dr. Claw right out in the open; oh well. The other thing that's sort of ridiculous about the film are the physics behind certain scenes. Again, this is a cartoon adaptation so things are kept unrealistic but still some scenes come off as being almost impossible. This whole movie is made to look like everyone is idiotic. I must say that it was done well because everyone in this movie are idiots, but they are funny idiots. Nielsen is good at making it look like he knows whom he's talking to even though he doesn't. The two spies played by Ernie Hudson and Stephen Tobolowsky are funny to watch too. They either end up knocking each other over just to see who can get to the finish line first or they end up knocking each other out altogether. Nick Chinlund who plays another doofus named Bob Morgan tries to get his hands on Mr. Magoo. What a wreck that guy was. Miguel Ferrer, from RoboCop (1987), plays the main villain in this film. His character is called Ortega Peru and although he's a mean villain, he doesn't impose himself as a bad guy. I guess that's what you get for being bad guy in a silly Disney comedy. The music is good too; it has a giddy jumpiness to it, which goes well with what Mr. Magoo does in this film. Not every scene will have big laughs but it's a cute, goofy, and fun filled movie for the family. Kids will definitely love it. Disney took a chance and although they failed to impress critics and the majority of Magoo fans, it still has a little charm to it. The movie is silly fun that makes Magoo look like he can handle anything that's placed or thrown in his way, even though he can't which makes it all the more unrealistic for a live-action cartoon.

    Leslie Nielsen is the best thing about 'Mr. Magoo'. Like always, the late legend delivers a spirited & lovable performance, that, truly, translates into this film's biggest merit. 'Mr. Magoo' Synopis: The myopic millionaire defeats jewel smugglers in his usual bumbling manner. As a film, 'Mr. Magoo' is fairly entertaining. Some jokes work, while some aren't really appealing or funny. The Screenplay isn't great, but fair nonetheless. Stanley Tong's Direction, is decent. Cinematography & Editing, are strictly okay. Performance-Wise: Apart from Nielsen, there is no performance in particular that stands out. All the actors abroad apart from Nielsen, lend ordinary to good support. On the whole, 'Mr. Magoo' is a fair entertainer.

    This is far from Leslie Nielson's best movie, that's Airplane or Naked Gun, but Mr Magoo in my opinion is far better than the crap-fest that is 2001:A Space Travesty. As for Mr Magoo, I don't think it was that bad. It was far from perfect, being a little too short and have a story that was on the predictable side. But I do think it is underrated, I thought it was entertaining and fun which is more than I can say for some of the movies I hate, some of which are only a couple of notches higher than this one (ie. Freddy Got Fingered). As for the rating, I do think 3.4 is too low, around the 5.9-6.0 region is more like it. So what did I like about Mr Magoo? Well the fact I was entertained by it helped. The script is amusing, and there are some fun gags, including a hilarious scene in the kitchen. The film does look reasonably good too with good locations and the photography and editing doesn't look as cheap as one might think. The soundtrack is suitably upbeat, the film moves quickly and the direction is pretty decent. And the acting was at least okay too, Nielson was a genius when it came to comedy and while he has been better he does seem to be enjoying himself and Mr Magoo himself is a fun and likable character. Out of the supporting cast, Ernie Hudson, Miguel Ferrer and especially Malcolm McDowell were fun, and Jennifer Garner was okay. All in all, the film is far from perfect but it wasn't bad either. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    I am really a huge fan of Mr. Magoo and so when I had heard about this movie, I decided that I was going to see it despite the fact that it really got some bad reviews. But I was not going to let bad reviews affect my judgment, so I went ahead and saw this movie. And when I saw this, I thought that it was really hysterical, in fact, I was in pain from laughing so hard! This film has very big laughs, in my opinion, I was really surprised at how funny this movie was! Mr. Magoo has always been one of my favorite animated characters, because like a lot of many other ones, I really found him funny! This movie is extremely underrated in my opinion, it is not the funniest movie that I have ever seen, but it is one of the funniest movies that I have seen in a couple of years! To me, Mr. Magoo is not a terrible movie, it seems that it was just ahead of its time and the world was not ready for it, but despite what a lot of people said, I thought that this movie was a laugh fest, this movie is filled with a lot of laughs, so many laughs, that I was crying with laughter and that at times no sound was coming out! I could just watch this movie over and over again! I thought that Leslie Nielsen was the perfect choice to play Mr. Magoo, well to me, Leslie Nielsen is really a funny guy, and so I guess that is what made him really great for the part! This movie is really a fun time that I would just watch whenever I would be in the mood for something funny, because I think that this film is criminally underrated! Mr. Magoo is a spectacularly funny film, it has got a lot of laughs in it that will leave you in stitches! You will be laughing and laughing out loud when you watch this! Get ready to see a movie that is really hysterical thought really underrated, Mr. Magoo! When you watch this movie, you probably might like it like I did. No wait, I did not like Mr. Magoo, I really loved it! I could just watch this over and over again and laugh even more each time! 10/10
