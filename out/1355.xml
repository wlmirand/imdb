 <sinopse>
  Story of the early life of genius and Nobel Prize-winning physicist Richard Feynman.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  As a young boy, Richard was fascinated with science and objects in motion. This wonderment was reinforced through the efforts of his father. The only thing that mattered as much as science, and his family, was Arline, whom he met when they were both in school. But fate can often be cruel and Arline is found to be stricken by Tuberculosis. Undaunted, Richard studies the disease as he studies science in hopes of curing her. When her disease is in remission, they marry and he proceeds on to college where his studies and the war lead him to Los Alamos to work on the Manhattan Project. While Richard is intrigued with the solution to the project, he is also concerned with the outcome and saddened with the failing health of Arline.

    This film had a lot of potential and would have been a story well told if only it had not been too stylish and downright anchored in sepiatic based nostalgia. There was absolutely no need to turn a a potentially good film into a gloomy dark film. Even the scenes where the film is in daylight it is downright gloomy and often hard to see any contrast between the players and you have to wonder what idiotic rationale was behind that. Apart from that the story was full of images and style and really did not have a good narrative. I have just finished watching 'The Challenger' - that focused on Feynman's role in the enquiry - now that is the way to tell a story.

    **A review for those who have already watched the movie** There are a lot of great stories to be told; I often wonder why so many have not been. A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film. The world is full of people who tell us what we can not know, yet whether or not they are as wise as they may believe themselves, I have yet to see anyone argue another's ignorance as convincingly or as wittily as Socrates (and with a crucial difference, by first asking what they know, and actually listening to how they think they know it) -- or for as noble a purpose. So when I found that a movie had been made about one of my heroes, I was very eager to see what it amounted to. I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him. For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the "niche" audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This "low" score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring. The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old "friend" Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed "it was too much." I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of. I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and "the book is always better." I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

    Wow. I was so happy to find out that there was a movie about Richard Feynman. I have read a couple of his books, and I am totally amazed of his life. What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know. Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this. If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book. Feynman deserves to be known better... he is one of the best scientists of our time, and one of the greatest persons of our time.

    This is an impressive and thoughtful film about early incidents in the life of the famous Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynmann (1918-1988). The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity: in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them. There are some intriguing references to the spy Klaus Fuchs, but all we see of him is his car which Feynman borrows. Fuchs's keys are missing at one point, but we aren't told why. Presumably the man picked up by Feynman in the nearby New Mexico desert and given a lift, who pretends not to speak English but actually is fluent in it, is a Soviet agent passing messages for Fuchs, but this is not spelled out. Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready. But all that is a digression, This is a very fine film and deserves recognition, as it is well made and genuinely felt, and is eminently worthwhile.

    I give this movie 9/10, the one mark is deducted because this movie is not the best introduction to Feynman's life and does not do enough justice to his great personality. To fully enjoy the movie you must first read Feynman's two books, "What do you care what other people think?' and 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' The first is essential, the second is optional. Both are light reading type of books with loads of jokes but they have their sensitive side as well. On the whole well balance. Now if you read the book, you will get a good insight into Feynman's personality. Then the movie will be like the frosting on top of your Feynman cake. I wish the director had done a better job, it would have introduced so many more people to the life and works of Richard P. Feynman.

    This was kind of a strange, low-key movie, one that isn't going to get a lot of attention, especially with a younger audience which wants anything but a slow- moving story. But, whatever your age, if you want simply a nice movie, you have one here. Other reviewers here have gone into the details about the real-life persons this film is based on, so I will just make a few general comments I had while watching this. First, I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's narration. Broderick usually plays likable roles and is an underrated actor, I think. I've never seen him in a bad performance. Even though this story is an emotional one, I found little emotion in the film but that makes it intriguing in parts. Sometime past the halfway mark, I asked myself, "What is the point of this story?" There is a point, and there is more than what meets the eye to this. Those who have seen this film know what I mean. I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything. I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama. Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film.

    Although I agree with other reviewers that the reaction of the Feynman character to his wife's death is so restrained as to appear cold, that is but a minor flaw in a striking film featuring a fantastic performance by Patricia Arquette. I have seen many tearjerkers in my life, but this is one of the few that actually makes me choke up when I remember certain scenes. The characters' integrity, the tragic backdrop of the Manhattan Project, the revealing details, the respectful rendering of quaint aspects of the era, the simple truths simply portrayed all make this a small masterpiece.

    This movie is a major disappointment to me. I looked forward to it after listening to many of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures. While doing a great job of showing the love between these two people, it totally misses out on showing Richard as a person unto himself. He is so unique that this is a massive oversight, to say the least. Despite his tragedy, I am sure he was just as irreverent and humorous during the Manhattan project as he was for the rest of his life. Yet only a couple of snippets show this irreverence and humor and even those are done badly. One is the repetitive exiting of the Los Alamos site to demonstrate the lousy security they had despite rigorous examination of everyone entering the site. The other was when he first met with the students in the data processing lab. That one too was far below what I'm sure the real Richard Feynman would have done, judging by how he treated his students in almost all of the lectures I have listened to. So Broderick took a whole person and cut him in half, only showing the intimate portion of his life and relationship with his wife that he loved so dearly. He almost completely left out the public persona of the man and this hurts the movie so badly that it never really recovers from it. It makes it a poor movie when it could have been a great movie, right up there with A Beautiful Mind. That is why I rated it a 3 instead of an 8 or 9 like it could have been.

    Matthew Broderick should be remembered for this film alone! His directing is wonderful and he manages to capture the beauty of New Mexico and the essential character of Richard Feynman. Patricia Arquette does her best work in her career in this film. He manages to capture the lessons of Feynman's youth and the influence of his father. This may be the essence of Feynman's genius and his ability to keep things in perspective despite the enormity of the undertaking and the severity of life. The scenes with Feynman's young wife Arline capture his playfulness and ability to teach through analogy and demonstration, the hallmark of his instructive method.

    Richard Feynman was famed for his playful, iconoclastic views and discoveries in the realm of theoretical physics; he won a Nobel Prize for his later work. But in the mid-1940's, he was a brilliant 25-year old kid working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and his beloved wife was dying of Hodgkins disease. The story of Arline and Richard Feynman might seem tepid or boring to non-Feymanauts, but anyone who has read "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" and especially "What do you care what other people think?" will love it. Broderick does a good job capturing Feynman's early persona -- brilliant, able to argue a physics problem with Robert Oppenheimer, but at heart still an awkward, shy young man madly in love with his doomed wife. Sweet, sad, and memorable.

    **A review for those who have already watched the movie** There are a lot of great stories to be told; I often wonder why so many have not been. A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film. The world is full of people who tell us what we can not know, yet whether or not they are as wise as they may believe themselves, I have yet to see anyone argue another's ignorance as convincingly or as wittily as Socrates (and with a crucial difference, by first asking what they know, and actually listening to how they think they know it) -- or for as noble a purpose. So when I found that a movie had been made about one of my heroes, I was very eager to see what it amounted to. I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him. For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the "niche" audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This "low" score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring. The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old "friend" Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed "it was too much." I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of. I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and "the book is always better." I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

    Wow. I was so happy to find out that there was a movie about Richard Feynman. I have read a couple of his books, and I am totally amazed of his life. What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know. Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this. If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book. Feynman deserves to be known better... he is one of the best scientists of our time, and one of the greatest persons of our time.

    This is an impressive and thoughtful film about early incidents in the life of the famous Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynmann (1918-1988). The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity: in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them.

Presumably the man picked up by Feynman in the nearby New Mexico desert and given a lift, who pretends not to speak English but actually is fluent in it, is a Soviet agent passing messages for Fuchs, but this is not spelled out. Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready. But all that is a digression, This is a very fine film and deserves recognition, as it is well made and genuinely felt, and is eminently worthwhile.

    I give this movie 9/10, the one mark is deducted because this movie is not the best introduction to Feynman's life and does not do enough justice to his great personality. To fully enjoy the movie you must first read Feynman's two books, "What do you care what other people think?' and 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' The first is essential, the second is optional. Both are light reading type of books with loads of jokes but they have their sensitive side as well. On the whole well balance. Now if you read the book, you will get a good insight into Feynman's personality. Then the movie will be like the frosting on top of your Feynman cake. I wish the director had done a better job, it would have introduced so many more people to the life and works of Richard P. Feynman.

    This was kind of a strange, low-key movie, one that isn't going to get a lot of attention, especially with a younger audience which wants anything but a slow- moving story. But, whatever your age, if you want simply a nice movie, you have one here. Other reviewers here have gone into the details about the real-life persons this film is based on, so I will just make a few general comments I had while watching this. First, I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's narration. Broderick usually plays likable roles and is an underrated actor, I think. I've never seen him in a bad performance. Even though this story is an emotional one, I found little emotion in the film but that makes it intriguing in parts. Sometime past the halfway mark, I asked myself, "What is the point of this story?" There is a point, and there is more than what meets the eye to this. Those who have seen this film know what I mean. I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything. I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama. Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film.

    Although I agree with other reviewers that the reaction of the Feynman character to his wife's death is so restrained as to appear cold, that is but a minor flaw in a striking film featuring a fantastic performance by Patricia Arquette. I have seen many tearjerkers in my life, but this is one of the few that actually makes me choke up when I remember certain scenes. The characters' integrity, the tragic backdrop of the Manhattan Project, the revealing details, the respectful rendering of quaint aspects of the era, the simple truths simply portrayed all make this a small masterpiece.

    This movie is a major disappointment to me. I looked forward to it after listening to many of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures. While doing a great job of showing the love between these two people, it totally misses out on showing Richard as a person unto himself. He is so unique that this is a massive oversight, to say the least. Despite his tragedy, I am sure he was just as irreverent and humorous during the Manhattan project as he was for the rest of his life. Yet only a couple of snippets show this irreverence and humor and even those are done badly. One is the repetitive exiting of the Los Alamos site to demonstrate the lousy security they had despite rigorous examination of everyone entering the site. The other was when he first met with the students in the data processing lab. That one too was far below what I'm sure the real Richard Feynman would have done, judging by how he treated his students in almost all of the lectures I have listened to. So Broderick took a whole person and cut him in half, only showing the intimate portion of his life and relationship with his wife that he loved so dearly. He almost completely left out the public persona of the man and this hurts the movie so badly that it never really recovers from it. It makes it a poor movie when it could have been a great movie, right up there with A Beautiful Mind. That is why I rated it a 3 instead of an 8 or 9 like it could have been.

    Matthew Broderick should be remembered for this film alone! His directing is wonderful and he manages to capture the beauty of New Mexico and the essential character of Richard Feynman. Patricia Arquette does her best work in her career in this film. He manages to capture the lessons of Feynman's youth and the influence of his father. This may be the essence of Feynman's genius and his ability to keep things in perspective despite the enormity of the undertaking and the severity of life. The scenes with Feynman's young wife Arline capture his playfulness and ability to teach through analogy and demonstration, the hallmark of his instructive method.

    Richard Feynman was famed for his playful, iconoclastic views and discoveries in the realm of theoretical physics; he won a Nobel Prize for his later work. But in the mid-1940's, he was a brilliant 25-year old kid working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and his beloved wife was dying of Hodgkins disease. The story of Arline and Richard Feynman might seem tepid or boring to non-Feymanauts, but anyone who has read "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" and especially "What do you care what other people think?" will love it. Broderick does a good job capturing Feynman's early persona -- brilliant, able to argue a physics problem with Robert Oppenheimer, but at heart still an awkward, shy young man madly in love with his doomed wife. Sweet, sad, and memorable.

    This film had a lot of potential and would have been a story well told if only it had not been too stylish and downright anchored in sepiatic based nostalgia. There was absolutely no need to turn a a potentially good film into a gloomy dark film. Even the scenes where the film is in daylight it is downright gloomy and often hard to see any contrast between the players and you have to wonder what idiotic rationale was behind that. Apart from that the story was full of images and style and really did not have a good narrative. I have just finished watching 'The Challenger' - that focused on Feynman's role in the enquiry - now that is the way to tell a story.

    **A review for those who have already watched the movie** There are a lot of great stories to be told; I often wonder why so many have not been. A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film. The world is full of people who tell us what we can not know, yet whether or not they are as wise as they may believe themselves, I have yet to see anyone argue another's ignorance as convincingly or as wittily as Socrates (and with a crucial difference, by first asking what they know, and actually listening to how they think they know it) -- or for as noble a purpose. So when I found that a movie had been made about one of my heroes, I was very eager to see what it amounted to. I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him. For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the "niche" audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This "low" score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring. The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old "friend" Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed "it was too much." I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of. I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and "the book is always better." I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

    Wow. I was so happy to find out that there was a movie about Richard Feynman. I have read a couple of his books, and I am totally amazed of his life. What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know. Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this. If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book. Feynman deserves to be known better... he is one of the best scientists of our time, and one of the greatest persons of our time.

    This is an impressive and thoughtful film about early incidents in the life of the famous Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynmann (1918-1988). The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity: in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them. There are some intriguing references to the spy Klaus Fuchs, but all we see of him is his car which Feynman borrows. Fuchs's keys are missing at one point, but we aren't told why. Presumably the man picked up by Feynman in the nearby New Mexico desert and given a lift, who pretends not to speak English but actually is fluent in it, is a Soviet agent passing messages for Fuchs, but this is not spelled out. Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready. But all that is a digression, This is a very fine film and deserves recognition, as it is well made and genuinely felt, and is eminently worthwhile.

    I give this movie 9/10, the one mark is deducted because this movie is not the best introduction to Feynman's life and does not do enough justice to his great personality. To fully enjoy the movie you must first read Feynman's two books, "What do you care what other people think?' and 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' The first is essential, the second is optional. Both are light reading type of books with loads of jokes but they have their sensitive side as well. On the whole well balance. Now if you read the book, you will get a good insight into Feynman's personality. Then the movie will be like the frosting on top of your Feynman cake. I wish the director had done a better job, it would have introduced so many more people to the life and works of Richard P. Feynman.

    This movie is a major disappointment to me. I looked forward to it after listening to many of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures. While doing a great job of showing the love between these two people, it totally misses out on showing Richard as a person unto himself. He is so unique that this is a massive oversight, to say the least. Despite his tragedy, I am sure he was just as irreverent and humorous during the Manhattan project as he was for the rest of his life. Yet only a couple of snippets show this irreverence and humor and even those are done badly. One is the repetitive exiting of the Los Alamos site to demonstrate the lousy security they had despite rigorous examination of everyone entering the site. The other was when he first met with the students in the data processing lab. That one too was far below what I'm sure the real Richard Feynman would have done, judging by how he treated his students in almost all of the lectures I have listened to. So Broderick took a whole person and cut him in half, only showing the intimate portion of his life and relationship with his wife that he loved so dearly. He almost completely left out the public persona of the man and this hurts the movie so badly that it never really recovers from it. It makes it a poor movie when it could have been a great movie, right up there with A Beautiful Mind. That is why I rated it a 3 instead of an 8 or 9 like it could have been.

    **A review for those who have already watched the movie** There are a lot of great stories to be told; I often wonder why so many have not been. A swordsman who wins over 100 duels in his life, his first beginning at the age of 13, and by his twenties maintains the handicap of using a wooden blade. Yet the tale of Miyomoto Musashi is one that I have not seen put to film.

I assume that either Matthew Broderick or his mother (or both) who wrote the screen play, must also have been a fan of Feynman. I wouldn't suppose to know everything about Feynman, but I have made an effort to learn everything that I could. I have read his books, looked through his Wikipedia and looked at just about everything I could track down that had anything to do with him. For me, as a physics student, the appeal of Feynman is mistranslated in the movie. He of course, was no ordinary genius, but how he accomplished what he did was as important (to the "niche" audience) as what he did, and the how seemed to be missing. Feynman developed his capacity for mental math during the Manhattan project via competition with Hans Bethe, and the development is key. The abacus scene was terrible for several reasons, some of them outlined in other reviews, chiefly for misrepresenting Feynman's personality. However the scene also sold out the accessibility of intelligence as something unique to certain individuals, that this was something 'natural' to Feynman. Feynman's IQ was measured at 125, which is supposed to be 15 points below the average PhD. Now, I'm not going to argue about the validity of IQ testing, one of the major personality traits the film wasn't able to touch on was of Feynman's insistence that people were incapable of measuring the aptitude of others' with tests. This "low" score however, was what is truly inspiring about Richard Feynman, that he never claimed to be more than a normal man. All his ability came from work driven by passion and love. Feynman wasn't a Japanese 4 year old who could speak 5 languages and solve Rubick's cubes blindfolded in 7 seconds. He was a lover of life and of learning, and it was his passion that motivated him to work hard, and his love that drove him to never give up and believe he could accomplish anything anyone else could. The real lesson of Feynman is that anyone can reach for greatness, and with drive and effort and luck attain it too. The Feynman story is one that allows us all to believe in ourselves, not one that should make us feel intimidated or insignificant. When Feynman can beat the abacus man at 18 with no background story of how his abilities came to be, it is far less inspiring. The performances were satisfying, but the story development seemed rushed, especially in the beginning. There was plenty of room for drama in the competition for Arlene with Feynman's old "friend" Howard without the need to throw in so many anecdotes that disrupt his life's true time line. I think that if you go through the books Feynman wrote only once, you miss how truly stressed Arlene's diminishing health made him. He was in many ways a subtle man, and private. When Feynman writes, I feel like he blindsides his readers from ever detecting how much he was hiding from them, with the sheer vulnerability he subjects himself to with his honesty. You can't see what hes not saying because he has already surprised you with the courage to say so much more than most people will admit to. To know how he was really feeling I think requires reading between the lines. When Feynman sees the dress, it is a total breakdown, it is overwhelming. In everything Feynman ever wrote, that was the only time he ever confessed "it was too much." I can hardly think of the scene depicted in his books without coming to tears, even now. The story of he and Arlene really is, as another reviewer put it, one of the greatest real love stories I have ever heard of. I don't know much about movies, and I understand there are limitations. You can't fit everything into 90 minutes and "the book is always better." I would be curious to hear Mr. Broderick explain why he went the way he did with certain aspects of the film. I certainly couldn't comment on whether writing, acting, and directing simultaneously would have been too much. If the film gets anyone to go and look up Richard Feynman, I think it will have served its purpose.

    Wow. I was so happy to find out that there was a movie about Richard Feynman. I have read a couple of his books, and I am totally amazed of his life. What he has achieved in science and what he has done outside science... he was such a character. To me, one of the most interesting characters I know. Everything begun well. There was certain quotes from Feynman's books that I expected. I was happy. But soon enough I realized everything was not OK... this was only a love story between Richard and Arline! No, there is certainly nothing wrong with a love story. This might be a decent love story between two individuals. But for people who know who Richard Feynman was, this must be a huge disappointment. He was so much more than this. He deserved more than this, and I still hope he gets a movie which is more than this. If you liked the movie and ended up wondering what else Feynman did during his lifetime, read his books (start up with Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman). Even if you did not like the movie, but you want to know more about Feynman, read the book. If you are, or if you are not, interested in science, read the book. Feynman deserves to be known better... he is one of the best scientists of our time, and one of the greatest persons of our time.

    This is an impressive and thoughtful film about early incidents in the life of the famous Nobel laureate physicist Richard Feynmann (1918-1988). The film is not about physics, but about the tragic love story between Feynman (played by Matthew Broderick) and his wife Arline (played by Patricia Arquette). This film, because of its subject matter, was always going to be for a niche audience, but was well worth making. The screenplay was written by Patricia Broderick, Matthew's mother, and they jointly produced the film. It is a pity that Broderick has not had further directorial opportunities in the years since this one, as he has a talent for it. But that is how ruthless the film business can be, as this was clearly no money-maker, because it is too quiet and sensitive and has no super-star to give it the public acceptance. It is a sleeper that did not awaken. Films where one of the leading characters is ill all the time (Feynman's wife), and especially one who has tuberculosis, are not generally successful at the box office. The last time TB made any money was with Greta Garbo as Camille. So by deciding to do this worthy project, the Brodericks were closing the door behind them. Investors hate TB and soft, gentle films in equal measure. (They prefer explosions and healthy killers.) I recently saw Matthew Broderick on the TV series WHO DO YOU THINK YOU ARE? where he traced his ancestors. His grandfather served in the First World War and his great-great-grandfather served in the American Civil War. (The programme resulted in his grave, which had been anonymous till then, having his name put on it. Previously he had been the unknown man killed in action outside Atlanta in Georgia on the Union side.) In the TV programme, it was obvious that Broderick is truly Mr. Nice Guy, all modesty and smiles, and that the 'boyish charm' for which he is renowned is perfectly genuine. Even though it was not his first film, FERRIS BUELLER'S DAY OFF (1986, see my review) burst like a comic miracle upon the scene at the time and launched Broderick, through the genius of John Hughes. Broderick is if anything even more delightful and amusing today. But he can be perfectly serious when required, as with this film. There is no use people complaining that Broderick is not as dynamic and mesmerising a presence as Feynman in his maturity: in this film, Feynman is never older than 27, so cool it. For much of the film, Feynman is working at Los Alamos developing the atomic bomb. Names like Wigner, Oppenheimer, and Fermi are mentioned, but we don't see them. There are some intriguing references to the spy Klaus Fuchs, but all we see of him is his car which Feynman borrows. Fuchs's keys are missing at one point, but we aren't told why. Presumably the man picked up by Feynman in the nearby New Mexico desert and given a lift, who pretends not to speak English but actually is fluent in it, is a Soviet agent passing messages for Fuchs, but this is not spelled out. Some of the script must have been cut, but it would have been better to leave those things in. There are many intriguing aspects to the story which are suggested in passing. For instance, Feynman raises the issue of the enrichment of Uranium. Someone ought to make a film about how the Uranium 235 was brought from Germany in a submarine (U-234, coincidentally) at the end of the War and used for the bombs over Japan because America did not have enough ready. But all that is a digression, This is a very fine film and deserves recognition, as it is well made and genuinely felt, and is eminently worthwhile.

    I give this movie 9/10, the one mark is deducted because this movie is not the best introduction to Feynman's life and does not do enough justice to his great personality. To fully enjoy the movie you must first read Feynman's two books, "What do you care what other people think?' and 'Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!' The first is essential, the second is optional. Both are light reading type of books with loads of jokes but they have their sensitive side as well. On the whole well balance. Now if you read the book, you will get a good insight into Feynman's personality. Then the movie will be like the frosting on top of your Feynman cake. I wish the director had done a better job, it would have introduced so many more people to the life and works of Richard P. Feynman.

    This was kind of a strange, low-key movie, one that isn't going to get a lot of attention, especially with a younger audience which wants anything but a slow- moving story. But, whatever your age, if you want simply a nice movie, you have one here. Other reviewers here have gone into the details about the real-life persons this film is based on, so I will just make a few general comments I had while watching this. First, I enjoyed Matthew Broderick's narration. Broderick usually plays likable roles and is an underrated actor, I think. I've never seen him in a bad performance. Even though this story is an emotional one, I found little emotion in the film but that makes it intriguing in parts. Sometime past the halfway mark, I asked myself, "What is the point of this story?" There is a point, and there is more than what meets the eye to this. Those who have seen this film know what I mean. I'm making vague statements, but I don't want to give away anything. I enjoyed the 1940s look to this, appreciated Patricia Arquette's against-type role; appreciated the fact there were no villains in here and the profanity was low. As I said, it's a nice film and touching drama. Broderick and his mother wrote, produced and directed this film.

    Although I agree with other reviewers that the reaction of the Feynman character to his wife's death is so restrained as to appear cold, that is but a minor flaw in a striking film featuring a fantastic performance by Patricia Arquette. I have seen many tearjerkers in my life, but this is one of the few that actually makes me choke up when I remember certain scenes. The characters' integrity, the tragic backdrop of the Manhattan Project, the revealing details, the respectful rendering of quaint aspects of the era, the simple truths simply portrayed all make this a small masterpiece.

    This movie is a major disappointment to me. I looked forward to it after listening to many of Richard Feynman's Physics lectures. While doing a great job of showing the love between these two people, it totally misses out on showing Richard as a person unto himself. He is so unique that this is a massive oversight, to say the least. Despite his tragedy, I am sure he was just as irreverent and humorous during the Manhattan project as he was for the rest of his life. Yet only a couple of snippets show this irreverence and humor and even those are done badly. One is the repetitive exiting of the Los Alamos site to demonstrate the lousy security they had despite rigorous examination of everyone entering the site. The other was when he first met with the students in the data processing lab. That one too was far below what I'm sure the real Richard Feynman would have done, judging by how he treated his students in almost all of the lectures I have listened to. So Broderick took a whole person and cut him in half, only showing the intimate portion of his life and relationship with his wife that he loved so dearly. He almost completely left out the public persona of the man and this hurts the movie so badly that it never really recovers from it. It makes it a poor movie when it could have been a great movie, right up there with A Beautiful Mind. That is why I rated it a 3 instead of an 8 or 9 like it could have been.

    Matthew Broderick should be remembered for this film alone! His directing is wonderful and he manages to capture the beauty of New Mexico and the essential character of Richard Feynman. Patricia Arquette does her best work in her career in this film. He manages to capture the lessons of Feynman's youth and the influence of his father. This may be the essence of Feynman's genius and his ability to keep things in perspective despite the enormity of the undertaking and the severity of life. The scenes with Feynman's young wife Arline capture his playfulness and ability to teach through analogy and demonstration, the hallmark of his instructive method.

    Richard Feynman was famed for his playful, iconoclastic views and discoveries in the realm of theoretical physics; he won a Nobel Prize for his later work. But in the mid-1940's, he was a brilliant 25-year old kid working on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos, and his beloved wife was dying of Hodgkins disease. The story of Arline and Richard Feynman might seem tepid or boring to non-Feymanauts, but anyone who has read "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman" and especially "What do you care what other people think?" will love it. Broderick does a good job capturing Feynman's early persona -- brilliant, able to argue a physics problem with Robert Oppenheimer, but at heart still an awkward, shy young man madly in love with his doomed wife. Sweet, sad, and memorable.
