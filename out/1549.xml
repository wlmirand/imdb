 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Jakob arrives at the Institute Benjamenta (run by brother and sister Johannes and Lisa Benjamenta) to learn to become a servant. With seven other men, he studies under Lisa: absurd lessons of movement, drawing circles, and servility. He asks for a better room. No other students arrive and none leave for employment. Johannes is unhappy, imperious, and detached from the school's operation. Lisa is beautiful, at first tightly controlled, then on the verge of breakdown. There's a whiff of incest. Jakob is drawn to Lisa, and perhaps she to him. As winter sets in, she becomes catatonic. Things get worse; Johannes notes that all this has happened since Jakob came. Is there any cause and effect?

    I am a great admirer of the brothers' work, "Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies" (1989) and the "Stille Nacht" films among my favourites of all-time. Their world is esoteric; it's organic and all the same strangely inviting with a clear hint of heartfelt humor, far from sardonic that one might expect, considering how bleak their films seem at first glance. But I've struggled with "The PianoTuner of Earthquakes" (2005), their second endeavor to long-form filmmaking. This led me to shun "Institute Benjamenta" at first, and only this spring did I man up, largely thanks to the wonderful Blu-ray edition released by the British Film Institute. Perhaps due to my skewed expectations, I didn't warm up to it the first time around. But the second time I liked it a lot more already, and now that I'm slowly starting to appreciate certain aspects of it, I think next visits will be even more enjoyable and rewarding. That said, there are two things I like about it more than anything. The first is the play on the number zero, that is, nothingness. It goes deep into Shakespearean territory of absolute darkness manifested in "King Lear", and of course carries through the centuries, sometimes playfully ("Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"). There's a well-written essay on the subject in the booklet for the Blu-ray released by the British Film Insitute, written by Samuel Frederick called "Redemption of the Miniature: The Quay Brothers and Robert Walser". This nothingness in the form of the number zero becomes a visual motif that runs throughout the film, reverberating in the very fabric of the visual design. The other utterly masterful aspect of the film is the lighting. It's animated, fleeting, foreboding, sometimes resting on the characters' faces tiredly, sometimes dancing around them and on "everyday" objects (as if there were such things in a Quay film). It's this means of expression wherein the abnormal-seeming beautiful nightmare that is their cinematic world really lives and breathes.

    In reading the comments, it occurred to me that many who have watched this film have missed the point. There are some very thoughtful comments to be sure and this is a very thought provoking film. I think that the analogy between this film and Eraserhead is a valid one but not for the reasons stated. Institute Benjamenta and Eraserhead are both films that to my mind are not to be viewed in the same way as Hollywood fare where plot and story is everything. These films are meant to be appreciated in the same way you would go to a museum and look at something by Van Gogh or Dali. These films are cinema paintings designed to wash over you and envelope you in a way that a plot-based film traditional film seldom does. Most filmmakers are strapped tightly into a box which is the "Hollywood Formula". That form is very rigid and if you want to make films consistently in Hollywood you have to conform. The Brothers Quay have paid dearly for their invention and artistry. It's very hard for them to get money to make these films. They don't need to fix "Institute" by being better, we need to fix ourselves for being too limited in our acceptance of what a film can be. This film is a work of unbridled genius. I only say "God Bless them and give us MORE!

    A difficult and dreamlike film that mixes elements of the period squalor and steam punk expressionism of an early David Lynch, with the archaic self-awareness of Guy Maddin at his most starkly referential. Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life (1995) will surely repel just as many viewers as it excites; with its combination of slow, abstract, carefully composed black and white imagery and elliptical narrative structures filled with codes and ciphers managing to be both pretentious and fascinating in equal measures. At its best, the atmosphere is continually beguiling and often like nothing else we've ever experienced; with every single frame of this bizarre odyssey into the notions of fractured, nocturnal ambiance and closeted sensuality being tightly composed and beautiful to look at. However, at its worst, it is infuriatingly beyond comprehension; with the mood and the tone leading the film, almost like poetry, beyond the outdated notions of structure or momentum, and instead leaving us with a film that is overwhelming in its unique vision and design, but simply devoid of any sense of feeling or philosophy for an audience to fully grasp on to. This isn't a flaw in itself, as cinema is ultimately beyond the trite notions of character and plot, but even then, a film should, in my mind at least, have the potential to make us think and feel. As with all great art there should be some idea attached to it; something that stands out and resonates either emotionally or intellectually (or both) that makes the process of viewing more rewarding on an entirely personal level. You have to really search for it here, and clearly, judging from the past reviews, my fellow commentators have also struggled to unearth any overall sense of meaning from the film's emptily cryptic images and emphasis on dreamlike atmospherics. If the point of the film was simply to conjure this world within the mind of the viewer, then the film is a great success; with the meandering, drifting as if sleepwalking tone of the film being both striking and evocative from the first frame until the last. That said, there's only so far we can go with lovingly choreographed sequences of dance and movement combined with the amazing use of editing and shot construction, which finds stories in even the most minor or mundane of actions, though sadly, nothing that would point to an overall theme or interpretation. I suppose it is indicative of the directors' joint backgrounds in animation, or their fondness and appreciation for the films of Jan ÂŠvankmajer or Juraj Herz, with the emphasis placed on the look and feel of the film, rather than any kind of connection to the material. Or maybe there is and we just need to look deeper; to scratch beneath the surface and persevere with the free-flowing narrative, to see the clues that lurk beneath. Regardless of how you approach it - and with these particular "flaws" in mind - the film is still a fascinating work; with that atmosphere and somewhat Eastern European look and feel of the film being unrivalled, and again, unlike anything else we've ever experienced. Added to this, the central performances from Mark Rylance and Alice Krige are both exceptionally detailed, even within such an evasive and enigmatic construct. At any rate, Institute Benjamenta is certainly a difficult film to recommend, but an even more difficult one to dismiss; with the hints of the brothers' earlier, animated work - such as Street of Crocodiles (1986) and Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies (1988) drawing obvious parallels - and combining it with an approach that is memorable and purely cinematic.

    ...especially Alice Krige! The directing, however, I would have liked more without its over enthusiastic surreal demeanour. The story and essence of the picture as well as its atmosphere and its meaning in reference to the real world fall much to short. What a waste of attitude and art as the ideas of presenting and most acting were captivating. But in lack of a coherent story the movie became what it is...art, with a meaning somewhere to find (Dal&iacute; meets a narcissistic form of Kafka) - instead of a beautiful and moving picture with deep meaning. All just for art's sake? e.g. why is she speaking Dutch and other languages several times? Why overdoing it? Why this shabby and in a way arrogant symbolism? Didn't read the book by Robert Walser (Jakob von Gunten) - but now I'm interested and hope it's better.

    The Brothers Quay continue employ their unique style in their first feature film, except that this time around there are real people - not to mention dialog. Their first attempt at something half-way close to semi-normal turns out to be a visually excellent film, where images steal the show, while the plot (if there is one) remains known only to the Quay Brothers. The "story" is very vague, and in that way this film reminds me of "Eraserhead" (though "Eraserhead" is even more abstract); also reminds me of Lynch's movie as far as the mood and the small amount of dialog is concerned. There are some truly weird scenes here. And while watching "Eraserhead" is an intense experience, watching this film turns out to be rather relaxing at times. Additional viewings don't help much in clarifying things. Or maybe I'm just too dumb.

    Pretension with a microbudget. Larry Miller says, 'art shouldn't wring its hands': I was so happy to have found this DVD after years of searching, but got weltschmerz instead of zeitgeist. Dreary, angsty, self-congratulating symbolism, and may I never see another antler, even an ironic pair. I'm a fan of Mark Rylance's stage and most of his film work, but this is a clinker. It reminds me of another wankerish flick, Guy Maddin's 'Tales from the Gimli Hospital': same crummy film stock, same low-budget pretension, same deep need for the directors to use their audience as therapists. 'Institute' appears to have been shot with a videocam & bargain-basement special effects doubtless by the director brothers; it has the makings of an OK 4-minute video, but the occasional beautiful shot of Mark Rylance's beautiful mouth can't make up for the wanna-be Bergman antics. Nine, circles, hell, we get it. Sheesh. you don't have to hit us over the head with the cloven hoof. Run, my friends, run far, far away. Rent 'Wild Strawberries' for the Bergman, 'Angels and Insects' for the Rylance, 'Excalibur' for the Orff, and 'Blood and Donuts' for the low-budget horror passion play that *works*: you'll thank me. Two stars for Mark Rylance's mouth's acting.

    It is fairly rare that moving pictures are made with real artistic value in mind and even more rare when the endeavor pays off. Well, The Quay brothers' Institute Benjamenta is one such picture. At first sight it might appear a little too pretentious with an abounding array of hidden symbolism of a strange and antique meaning but then again, the basic thread of the picture is as old as humanity itself, pointing back to the ancestral roots of what makes us human: to love and to loose. It is remarkable the technique and the rendering of the camera in the Quay brothers' masterpiece. You cannot but help wondering if the images themselves are not centuries old and, in a sense, that is exactly the aim of the picture, to make itself look old and timeless, at the same time. I urge anyone who is really looking for that special feeling films give us, far from commercialism and hollywoodia, to see this movie. Sure, most of you will find it a little bit hard to watch but if you give it patience and let the mood of the picture fill you from within your imagination then I think this will be a rewarding cinematic experience.

    Unfortunately I was not able to watch this film through to the end. It is slow and after about 20 minutes I felt I had seen it all. This is a pity as the black and white imagery that unfolded before my eyes was breathtakingly beautiful. But somehow I expect a movie to tell me a story, to get me involved in the character's lives in some way or other. In this aspect the movie really does fail miserably. It's just a big freak show. Too much style, hardly any substance. The movie is based on a novel by Swiss writer Robert Walser. It was first published around 1910 and reads like excerpts of the author's diary. In their diaries people explore their selves and their relationship with the external world. I think the main problem with Instituten Benjamenta is its failure to distinguish between the external and the internal world Â– it's just one big stage with a kind of a waiting room atmosphere. That's very fashionable in Modern European Theatre of our days. It can also be very, very, boring. A much better introduction into Walser's world is Thomas Koerfer's movie Der Geh&uuml;lfe. No doubt the Brothers Quay are talented artists. Their movies live through the imagery, not from the narrative. This is ideal for music videos but maybe less so for a full length feature film.

    Every now and again a film like Institute Benjamenta comes along which seems to have the sole purpose of testing the endurance of its audience to the limit. I saw it at the home of art-house cinema in the UK, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and was intrigued to notice that even here, where it could reasonably expect a sympathetic viewing, over half of the (small) audience decamped to the bar well before it ground to a close. I stuck it out to the end only because my companion seemed riveted, but it turned out she was hanging on grimly thinking I was similarly entranced! Mark Rylance (a wonderful actor) goes through the film with the expression of a mildly startled rabbit on his face, as if he couldn't quite believe what he had got himself into - neither could I.

I urge anyone who is really looking for that special feeling films give us, far from commercialism and hollywoodia, to see this movie. Sure, most of you will find it a little bit hard to watch but if you give it patience and let the mood of the picture fill you from within your imagination then I think this will be a rewarding cinematic experience.

    Unfortunately I was not able to watch this film through to the end. It is slow and after about 20 minutes I felt I had seen it all. This is a pity as the black and white imagery that unfolded before my eyes was breathtakingly beautiful. But somehow I expect a movie to tell me a story, to get me involved in the character's lives in some way or other. In this aspect the movie really does fail miserably. It's just a big freak show. Too much style, hardly any substance. The movie is based on a novel by Swiss writer Robert Walser. It was first published around 1910 and reads like excerpts of the author's diary. In their diaries people explore their selves and their relationship with the external world. I think the main problem with Instituten Benjamenta is its failure to distinguish between the external and the internal world Â– it's just one big stage with a kind of a waiting room atmosphere. That's very fashionable in Modern European Theatre of our days. It can also be very, very, boring. A much better introduction into Walser's world is Thomas Koerfer's movie Der Geh&uuml;lfe. No doubt the Brothers Quay are talented artists. Their movies live through the imagery, not from the narrative. This is ideal for music videos but maybe less so for a full length feature film.

    Every now and again a film like Institute Benjamenta comes along which seems to have the sole purpose of testing the endurance of its audience to the limit. I saw it at the home of art-house cinema in the UK, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and was intrigued to notice that even here, where it could reasonably expect a sympathetic viewing, over half of the (small) audience decamped to the bar well before it ground to a close. I stuck it out to the end only because my companion seemed riveted, but it turned out she was hanging on grimly thinking I was similarly entranced! Mark Rylance (a wonderful actor) goes through the film with the expression of a mildly startled rabbit on his face, as if he couldn't quite believe what he had got himself into - neither could I.

    I am a great admirer of the brothers' work, "Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies" (1989) and the "Stille Nacht" films among my favourites of all-time. Their world is esoteric; it's organic and all the same strangely inviting with a clear hint of heartfelt humor, far from sardonic that one might expect, considering how bleak their films seem at first glance. But I've struggled with "The PianoTuner of Earthquakes" (2005), their second endeavor to long-form filmmaking. This led me to shun "Institute Benjamenta" at first, and only this spring did I man up, largely thanks to the wonderful Blu-ray edition released by the British Film Institute. Perhaps due to my skewed expectations, I didn't warm up to it the first time around. But the second time I liked it a lot more already, and now that I'm slowly starting to appreciate certain aspects of it, I think next visits will be even more enjoyable and rewarding. That said, there are two things I like about it more than anything. The first is the play on the number zero, that is, nothingness. It goes deep into Shakespearean territory of absolute darkness manifested in "King Lear", and of course carries through the centuries, sometimes playfully ("Alice's Adventures in Wonderland"). There's a well-written essay on the subject in the booklet for the Blu-ray released by the British Film Insitute, written by Samuel Frederick called "Redemption of the Miniature: The Quay Brothers and Robert Walser". This nothingness in the form of the number zero becomes a visual motif that runs throughout the film, reverberating in the very fabric of the visual design. The other utterly masterful aspect of the film is the lighting. It's animated, fleeting, foreboding, sometimes resting on the characters' faces tiredly, sometimes dancing around them and on "everyday" objects (as if there were such things in a Quay film). It's this means of expression wherein the abnormal-seeming beautiful nightmare that is their cinematic world really lives and breathes.

    it is really beautiful. fragile, cold and courageous. because it is little more than art film. or adaptation. it may be a dream fresco, a puzzle or a form of poem. it is special meeting with a delicate meeting front with profound world in which Expresionism art, Kafka lines, Surrealism and Oniric circles are frontiers of this work. crumbs of magic, dark questions confuse desires, memories from past for East European people and shadows of characters. and flavor of many nuances of acting. paper ash colors, gray feelings and strange forms of life. a parable about basic values and hole of emotions. version for a Gloomy Sunday and exploration of a trip without end.

    In reading the comments, it occurred to me that many who have watched this film have missed the point. There are some very thoughtful comments to be sure and this is a very thought provoking film. I think that the analogy between this film and Eraserhead is a valid one but not for the reasons stated. Institute Benjamenta and Eraserhead are both films that to my mind are not to be viewed in the same way as Hollywood fare where plot and story is everything. These films are meant to be appreciated in the same way you would go to a museum and look at something by Van Gogh or Dali. These films are cinema paintings designed to wash over you and envelope you in a way that a plot-based film traditional film seldom does. Most filmmakers are strapped tightly into a box which is the "Hollywood Formula". That form is very rigid and if you want to make films consistently in Hollywood you have to conform. The Brothers Quay have paid dearly for their invention and artistry. It's very hard for them to get money to make these films. They don't need to fix "Institute" by being better, we need to fix ourselves for being too limited in our acceptance of what a film can be. This film is a work of unbridled genius. I only say "God Bless them and give us MORE!

    A difficult and dreamlike film that mixes elements of the period squalor and steam punk expressionism of an early David Lynch, with the archaic self-awareness of Guy Maddin at his most starkly referential. Institute Benjamenta, or This Dream People Call Human Life (1995) will surely repel just as many viewers as it excites; with its combination of slow, abstract, carefully composed black and white imagery and elliptical narrative structures filled with codes and ciphers managing to be both pretentious and fascinating in equal measures. At its best, the atmosphere is continually beguiling and often like nothing else we've ever experienced; with every single frame of this bizarre odyssey into the notions of fractured, nocturnal ambiance and closeted sensuality being tightly composed and beautiful to look at. However, at its worst, it is infuriatingly beyond comprehension; with the mood and the tone leading the film, almost like poetry, beyond the outdated notions of structure or momentum, and instead leaving us with a film that is overwhelming in its unique vision and design, but simply devoid of any sense of feeling or philosophy for an audience to fully grasp on to. This isn't a flaw in itself, as cinema is ultimately beyond the trite notions of character and plot, but even then, a film should, in my mind at least, have the potential to make us think and feel. As with all great art there should be some idea attached to it; something that stands out and resonates either emotionally or intellectually (or both) that makes the process of viewing more rewarding on an entirely personal level. You have to really search for it here, and clearly, judging from the past reviews, my fellow commentators have also struggled to unearth any overall sense of meaning from the film's emptily cryptic images and emphasis on dreamlike atmospherics. If the point of the film was simply to conjure this world within the mind of the viewer, then the film is a great success; with the meandering, drifting as if sleepwalking tone of the film being both striking and evocative from the first frame until the last. That said, there's only so far we can go with lovingly choreographed sequences of dance and movement combined with the amazing use of editing and shot construction, which finds stories in even the most minor or mundane of actions, though sadly, nothing that would point to an overall theme or interpretation. I suppose it is indicative of the directors' joint backgrounds in animation, or their fondness and appreciation for the films of Jan ÂŠvankmajer or Juraj Herz, with the emphasis placed on the look and feel of the film, rather than any kind of connection to the material. Or maybe there is and we just need to look deeper; to scratch beneath the surface and persevere with the free-flowing narrative, to see the clues that lurk beneath. Regardless of how you approach it - and with these particular "flaws" in mind - the film is still a fascinating work; with that atmosphere and somewhat Eastern European look and feel of the film being unrivalled, and again, unlike anything else we've ever experienced. Added to this, the central performances from Mark Rylance and Alice Krige are both exceptionally detailed, even within such an evasive and enigmatic construct. At any rate, Institute Benjamenta is certainly a difficult film to recommend, but an even more difficult one to dismiss; with the hints of the brothers' earlier, animated work - such as Street of Crocodiles (1986) and Rehearsals for Extinct Anatomies (1988) drawing obvious parallels - and combining it with an approach that is memorable and purely cinematic.

    ...especially Alice Krige! The directing, however, I would have liked more without its over enthusiastic surreal demeanour. The story and essence of the picture as well as its atmosphere and its meaning in reference to the real world fall much to short. What a waste of attitude and art as the ideas of presenting and most acting were captivating. But in lack of a coherent story the movie became what it is...art, with a meaning somewhere to find (Dal&iacute; meets a narcissistic form of Kafka) - instead of a beautiful and moving picture with deep meaning. All just for art's sake? e.g. why is she speaking Dutch and other languages several times? Why overdoing it? Why this shabby and in a way arrogant symbolism? Didn't read the book by Robert Walser (Jakob von Gunten) - but now I'm interested and hope it's better.

    The Brothers Quay continue employ their unique style in their first feature film, except that this time around there are real people - not to mention dialog. Their first attempt at something half-way close to semi-normal turns out to be a visually excellent film, where images steal the show, while the plot (if there is one) remains known only to the Quay Brothers. The "story" is very vague, and in that way this film reminds me of "Eraserhead" (though "Eraserhead" is even more abstract); also reminds me of Lynch's movie as far as the mood and the small amount of dialog is concerned. There are some truly weird scenes here. And while watching "Eraserhead" is an intense experience, watching this film turns out to be rather relaxing at times. Additional viewings don't help much in clarifying things. Or maybe I'm just too dumb.

    Pretension with a microbudget. Larry Miller says, 'art shouldn't wring its hands': I was so happy to have found this DVD after years of searching, but got weltschmerz instead of zeitgeist. Dreary, angsty, self-congratulating symbolism, and may I never see another antler, even an ironic pair. I'm a fan of Mark Rylance's stage and most of his film work, but this is a clinker. It reminds me of another wankerish flick, Guy Maddin's 'Tales from the Gimli Hospital': same crummy film stock, same low-budget pretension, same deep need for the directors to use their audience as therapists. 'Institute' appears to have been shot with a videocam & bargain-basement special effects doubtless by the director brothers; it has the makings of an OK 4-minute video, but the occasional beautiful shot of Mark Rylance's beautiful mouth can't make up for the wanna-be Bergman antics. Nine, circles, hell, we get it. Sheesh. you don't have to hit us over the head with the cloven hoof. Run, my friends, run far, far away. Rent 'Wild Strawberries' for the Bergman, 'Angels and Insects' for the Rylance, 'Excalibur' for the Orff, and 'Blood and Donuts' for the low-budget horror passion play that *works*: you'll thank me. Two stars for Mark Rylance's mouth's acting.

    It is fairly rare that moving pictures are made with real artistic value in mind and even more rare when the endeavor pays off. Well, The Quay brothers' Institute Benjamenta is one such picture. At first sight it might appear a little too pretentious with an abounding array of hidden symbolism of a strange and antique meaning but then again, the basic thread of the picture is as old as humanity itself, pointing back to the ancestral roots of what makes us human: to love and to loose. It is remarkable the technique and the rendering of the camera in the Quay brothers' masterpiece. You cannot but help wondering if the images themselves are not centuries old and, in a sense, that is exactly the aim of the picture, to make itself look old and timeless, at the same time. I urge anyone who is really looking for that special feeling films give us, far from commercialism and hollywoodia, to see this movie.
