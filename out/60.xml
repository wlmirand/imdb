 <sinopse>
  A woman struggles to find a way to live her life after the death of her husband and child.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  The first part of Kieslowski's trilogy on France's national motto: Liberty, Equality, and Fraternity. 'Blue' is the story of Julie who loses her husband, an acclaimed composer and her young daughter in a car accident. The film's theme of liberty is manifested in Julie's attempt to start life anew, free of personal commitments, belongings, grief or love. She intends to numb herself by withdrawing from the world and living completely independently, anonymously and in solitude in the Parisian metropolis. Despite her intentions, people from her former and present life intrude with their own needs. However, the reality created by the people who need and care about her, a surprising discovery and the music around which the film revolves heal Julie and draws her back to the land of the living.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

First of a trilogy of films dealing with contemporary French society concerns how the wife of a composer deals with the death of her husband and child . This is a tragic film , a symphony of pain and filmed in enjoyable style , good sense and high sensitivity . Subtle details make for careful viewing but it is a rewarding watch and a visual treat . Being necessary to keep an eye on cinematographic use of the color blue . Magnificent acting by Juliette Binoche who makes a real tour-of-force , she relies on the internalized affection rather than overwhelming displays for expression . Good support cast as Benoit Regent and Florence Pernal ; both of them also make appearances on the followings . The picture has various subtle references about trilogy such as : At one point, we see Julie carrying a box which, as a close-up shows, has prominently written across it the word "blanco", Spanish for white; in the next shot we are looking at her from behind, and she pauses in the street as a man in blue passes her on her left and a woman in red passes her on her right , this is a reference to the structure of the Three Colours trilogy - blue, white, red, in that order, mirroring the French flag . During one swimming scene in the blue pool, children in red and white bathing suits run out and jump in the water . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Slawomir Idziak , it is essential to be understood the story . As well as the musical score , Zbigniew Preisner composes a rousing and impressive soundtrack .

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

Its is based on a tragedy by a car accident and the subsequent consequences on an affecting woman . Julia , Juliette Binoche, reshapes her existence after dieing her husband and their little young daughter . After surviving Julia , she has a feeling of grief and sells her properties and buys a flat in the city . She lives lonely but discovers a dark secret about her deceased husband , a former famous composer . First of a trilogy of films dealing with contemporary French society concerns how the wife of a composer deals with the death of her husband and child . This is a tragic film , a symphony of pain and filmed in enjoyable style , good sense and high sensitivity . Subtle details make for careful viewing but it is a rewarding watch and a visual treat . Being necessary to keep an eye on cinematographic use of the color blue . Magnificent acting by Juliette Binoche who makes a real tour-of-force , she relies on the internalized affection rather than overwhelming displays for expression . Good support cast as Benoit Regent and Florence Pernal ; both of them also make appearances on the followings . The picture has various subtle references about trilogy such as : At one point, we see Julie carrying a box which, as a close-up shows, has prominently written across it the word "blanco", Spanish for white; in the next shot we are looking at her from behind, and she pauses in the street as a man in blue passes her on her left and a woman in red passes her on her right , this is a reference to the structure of the Three Colours trilogy - blue, white, red, in that order, mirroring the French flag . During one swimming scene in the blue pool, children in red and white bathing suits run out and jump in the water . Colorful and evocative cinematography by Slawomir Idziak , it is essential to be understood the story . As well as the musical score , Zbigniew Preisner composes a rousing and impressive soundtrack . The 1994 Annual Cesar Awards , presented by the French Academy of Cinematographic Arts and Sciences, it is France's main national film awards, considered by many in France, and internationally, to be the French equivalent of the American Academy Awards gave two deserved Cesar to the best actress Juliette Binoche and the best film , for this above average film titled &uml;Blue&uml; . Rating : Good , worthwhile watching . The picture was followed by &uml;Trois Couleurs : Blanc&uml; , a bittersweet comedic story spiced with lasting love and vengeance , in which a bewildered Polish hairdresser is divorced by his disdainful French spouse and returning to his family in Poland when he decides to fake his death ; being starred by July Delpy and Zamachowski , including cameos by Juliette Binoche and Florence Pernal . And &uml;Trois Couleurs : Rouge&uml; starred by Irene Jacob , Jean Louis Trintignat , Frederique Feder and cameos by protagonists in the earlier film , Juliette Binoche and Benoit Regent ; &uml;Red&uml; is for fraternity in the Fench tricolor flag , dealing with emotional connections are mad between unlikely couples and director Kieslowski uses the ending to tie up loose ends .

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already?

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Polish screenwriter and director Krzysztof Kieslowski's tenth feature film which was written by Krzysztof Kieslowski, Krzysztof Piesiewicz, Agnieszka Holland, Slawomir Idziak and Edward Zebrowski, is the first part of his trilogy about the national flag of France's three colors blue, white and red which represents freedom, equality and fraternity. It tells the story of Julie Vignon, a 33-year-old woman who one day wakes up in a hospital in Paris after a car accident and learns that her husband and their five-year-old daughter has departed. In a state of shock and without the ability to react rationally Julie tries to commit suicide, but her will to live prevents her from it. After she is released from the hospital she instantly takes care of the financial formalities and moves from her old house to an apartment in the city. Julie chooses to live an isolated life, distances herself from human contact and digs herself into an introvert grieving process which cuts her of from her own existence. The main aspects in this visually exceptional and in-depth study of character from the early 1990s, is the main character's grief and the symbolic color blue. Krzysztof Kieslowski's vague allusion about the color blue symbolizing freedom may seem somewhat intangible as the protagonist's loss of her family seems to be the crucial moment which brings her back to her independent freedom. Still it becomes evident in the scenes where the color blue intertwines with Julie's being that it is only within these moments she comes close to mending her grief and thereby liberates herself from her opposition. Thus the color blue is perceived as the symbol of her soul. It's conceivable that Julie is a somewhat dependent woman who has lived her life in sheltered surroundings and always relied on having someone around her. Because of this it may seem as if Julie's loss is a key element in a greater plan life has initiated in order to test her survival skills and her will to live. With her introvert and emphatic acting performance which is one of her most memorable, French actress Juliette Binoche creates a mysterious and fascinating portrait of a grief-stricken woman. A performance which gained her the Pasinetti Award for Best Actress at the Venice Film Festival in 1993. Filmed with precision and great sense of detail, Krzysztof Kieslowski provides fragmentary insights into the soul of the central character. The sporadic editing, the poignant and multilateral atmosphere and Juliette Binoche's versatile facial expressions creates a lurking unpredictability. The compassionate and philosophical screenplay, the idyllic production design by Claude Lenoir, the prominent cinematography by Polish cinematographer Slawomir Idziak and the masterful score by Polish composer Zbigniew Preisner harmonizes within a whole that constitutes a tangible masterpiece. This international co-production between Poland, France and Switzerland which was shot on different locations in France gained amongst others seven awards at the Venice Film Festival in 1993, three awards at the C&egrave;sar Awards in 1994 and three nominations at the Golden Globe Awards in 1994. Krzysztof Kieslowski (1941-1996) tells the viewers more through images and actions in this mindful and gripping psychological drama.

    I find it very difficult to write about Blue. So much has been said about it already, especially by Annette Insdorf (who provides a superb commentary on the Miramax DVD and a video essay on the new Criterion Blu-Ray), that anything I could put forward would be mere repetition. The truth is that as dense as the film is, it's also quite simple. It doesn't require great effort to decode it, certainly not as much as Veronique. Kieslowski's ideas -- about "libert&eacute;", grief, love, the need to not be completely free of connectedness to others -- are very close to the surface. But there is such elegance to its simplicity that it never feels obvious. Only in hindsight does one think "Of course that's how it should be done" because it is all done so perfectly.

    Kieslowski's "Bleu," the first installment of the "Trois couleurs" series is a rapturous splendor, treading gracefully upon the grounds of hopelessness and disillusion experienced by Julie (Juliet Binoche) with a vibrance and intimacy that has never been matched - there is a certain parity at all times between Binoche's visceral performance and the serene metaphysical landscape painted by Salwomir Idziak's cinematography, which is constantly involved with the extraordinary aspects of the everyday that most refuse or aren't capable of seeing. Although Julie's spiritual transformation is the film's central focus, that metamorphosis isn't possible without Zbigniew Preisner's score. Like the balancing act of the camera and the performers, Preisner strikes a chord (if you'll excuse the pun) that resonates softly, initially, but as it drones on begins to echo the lingering antagonisms of consciousness that haunt the protagonist after her loss. On the other hand, it is in fact the harrowing reminder that is the music that allows Julie to reach the other side, to surface amidst the beautiful elegy that is closure and, in turn, release.

    A great movie from a famous director. For the first time, i knew "Krzysztof Kieslowski" by this this movie and suddenly, it makes me feel restless for watching more and more from him. Be specific on "Blue", this masterpiece could be watched over and over and every time it looks mysterious and challenging. Excellent directing, engaging screenplay, smooth and glazing plays especially by actress in leading role "Juliette Binoche" and last but surely not least music composed by Zbigniew Preisner make this movie unforgettable. Noteworthy, Blue is part of trilogy written and directed by "Krzysztof Kieslowski" that the other two are White and Red.

    Kieslowski's "Trois couleurs: Bleu" (1993) has been among my favourite films for as long as I can remember, yet it manages to surprise me with each viewing: it's so perfectly nuanced, emotionally heartbreaking and demanding, visually coherent and ipso fact perfect elaboration of film as art and art as something of value. The rest of the trilogy is just as mind-boggling in its brilliance, tenderly radical in its visual determination. But this! Nonpareil filmmaking only equaled in the past 20 years by Wong, Malick, Tarr and the Brothers Quay. Kieslowski sees beautifully: organically, rooted in true presence of not only the characters but us; us not only as observers but as participants. He does not only show but truly takes us there, not only refers to emotion but charges each image and sound abundantly with that which we may recognize in ourselves. Reciprocally, not patronizingly, so effortlessly. The smallest of objects become amplified in their significance, and this way Kieslowski and Tarkovsky are alike: the objects are given life much richer than what they usually are as simple d&eacute;cor. They are given memories and this makes them alive for us, since we can see them interface with the people inhabiting this lonely space. This film in particular speaks to me with such force because three things in particular it shares with me that I can share with it: music, family and death. All this in a work of art that exhibits powerful visual ingenuity and radical rethinking of the use of sound and image.

    ''There are a few shots in the film that seem to be unrelated to the story. This is yet another technique often used by Kieslowski to heighten the intellectual capacity of his films.'' This is a quote I read concerning this film and which to me sums up the pseudo-intellectual gobbledygook that seems to surround this director when he brings a new film to town. Yes, 'Blue' is a study in overcoming grief: it is also an exercise in over-indulgence. One of the 'unrelated shots' referred to would undoubtedly have been the scene where the camera pans away from a troubled Julie (Binoche) onto the street where an old lady, bent double with osteoporosis, is endeavouring to deposit a bottle into a bottle bank. The camera lingers while she labours to push the bottle through the slot. Mission accomplished the scene changes to something totally unrelated. What was the purpose of that scene? What did the pain of an crippled old lady have to do with Julie's tribulations? Is it Kieslowski's purpose in life to make you believe that every unrelated scene has some hidden symbolism or is he really having a laugh at how foolish we are. Having previous seen his 'Veronique' which was similarly puzzling I have reached the conclusion that this director now has a status, like that of many modern artists, where nobody dare criticise for fear of being called an intellectual philistine. On the credit side however is the use of classical music which engendered atmosphere something which it also achieved in 'Veronique'. Of Juliet Binoche what can be said that hasn't been said already? A superb actress with a wonderfully expressive face. In my opinion the only reason to watch this film.

    Blue is the first of Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy. It was followed by White and and Red, the colors of the French flag. Julie(Juliette Binoche) is married to a world famous classical music composer who dies along with their daughter in a car accident. She responds by almost committing suicide with pills but instead she leaves the hospital and takes an apartment by herself without telling anyone where she is going. She speaks with her senile mother on the phone, but her mother is confused and believes that her daughter is her sister. Julie destroys her husbands last composition, which was to celebrate the end of the cold war and European unity. There are hints that she actually wrote the piece. A former assistant of her husband, Olivier, is in love with her and announces on television that he will try to finish the final composition. Julie, meanwhile, discovers that her husband was having an affair. She tracks down the mistress, Sandrine, who is pregnant with the love child. This leads to an extremely unusual finale. I will not give it away; but it is well worth watching for Binoche's brilliant performance.

    "Trois Couleurs: Bleu" often ranks only second in Krzysztof Kieslowski's trilogy dealing with liberty, equality and friendship. True, the picture doesn't have the emotions on the forefront like Rouge does, but in its coldness, estrangement and portrayal of unspeakable desperation, its painful observation of someone who just cannot go on anymore lies its strength. Juliette Binoche plays a woman who epitomizes loss: her husband is dead, so is her daughter, all in an instant. Gone is what she was used to call her life, her passion for everything she ever cared for, the money has lost its importance, even her demented mother doesn't know anymore who she is, and it doesn't end there. Staggering on the brink of the abyss there is no will anymore to leap over the cliff, but even with the decision to retreat from everything the lives of others are affected... "Bleu" is the perfect combination of a visually oriented director, great script and editing (e.g. with inventive fade to blacks) - and an actress who perfectly understands how to play a grieving, inaccessible widow and at the same time the fragile being who could shatter any minute. Oh, and we shouldn't forget the importance of music in this movie, as this is what it's all about: To bring back music in someone's life in order to liberate the self from, well, let's say: being blue. It works so well that it hurts - but that's the purpose.

    Krzysztof Kieslowski explores grief and loss here with an authenticity, aided by the perfectly understated turn from Juliette Binoche, that is somehow simultaneously beautiful and ravaging. So many scenes leave a lasting impression. The moments of her succumbing to masochistic tendencies in order to feel something, anything other than the unbearable despair over her loss, are absolutely wrenching. Kieslowski doesn't lean towards melodrama for a moment here, never allowing his audience to feel as though they are watching a film take place, but rather presenting such a lived-in study of this level of devastation a person can experience. Binoche is on point every step of the way, somehow being expressive to the audience while shutting herself off from everyone around her. She is my favorite actress in the history of cinema and this is a glowing example as to why; even when she's saying nothing she is saying everything. Her face is so expressive in the most subtle of ways and here she puts that to remarkable use. Of course even if this wasn't such an emotionally profound piece, it would still manage to be a treat for the eyes, with Kieslowski making full use of his color palette in impressively vivid ways. That final shot, a hold on Binoche's face as tears quietly stream down it, was one of the few things that I had remembered from my initial viewing of the film years ago and it's easy to see why; it's haunting.
