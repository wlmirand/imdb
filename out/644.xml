 <sinopse>
  A film that successfully argued that a man was wrongly convicted for murder by a corrupt justice system in Dallas County, Texas.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Errol Morris's unique documentary dramatically re-enacts the crime scene and investigation of a police officer's murder in Dallas, Texas. Briefly, a drifter (Randall Adams) ran out of gas and was picked up by a 16-year-old runaway (David Harris). Later that night, they drank some beer, smoked some marijuana, and went to the movies. Then, their stories diverged. Adams claimed that he left for his motel, where he was staying with his brother, and went to sleep. Harris, however, said that they were stopped by police late that night, and Adams suddenly shot the officer approaching their car. The film shows the audience the evidence gathered by the police, who were under extreme pressure to clear the case. It strongly makes a point that the circumstantial evidence was very flimsy. In fact, it becomes apparent that Harris was a much more likely suspect and was in the middle of a crime spree, eventually ending up on Death Row himself for the later commission of other crimes. Morris implies ...

    A car thief. A juvenile. Someone hitching a ride. Police on patrol, a routine check. A dead officer, brutally shot - instant murder, on sight. There's bragging about a killing. And a memory gap. A search for a killer. Five witnesses. An unanimous verdict. No doubts whatsoever. A death sentence. Finally: an execution. - These at least are some facts of the case involving Randall Adams and David Harris, who met by chance at a Thanksgiving weekend on their way to Dallas. Components to form a larger picture, a picture that documentary filmmaker Errol Morris chose to redraw when he stumbled upon the case and grew more and more puzzled with its alarmingly unchallenged outcome before court. How does it all fit together, as the stories of the suspects obviously don't match? A private investigator himself at the time, Morris poses the right questions to everyone involved - Adams himself, Harris, the guy he hitched a ride from, the police, various detectives, witnesses, the attorneys. He also illustrates their versions on how the killing happened with contradicting re-enactments, usually a clear no-go for documentaries. Morris didn't know better what was expected of him at the time, but presenting the material cinematically - with close-ups, slow-motion and a haunting score by Phillip Glass - leaves a huge impact. However, except from his editing process, Morris lets the impressions stand as they are before the viewer without commenting himself. The result is intense and involving, spine-tingling, gripping and grizzly, and the last images will leave you shell-shocked and speechless. Criminals always lie, you know. Innocents usually tell the truth. Police should have an inkling in this regard. The riveting story of Randall Adams and David Harris doesn't end with the film. However, your trust in the Texan judiciary system might have reached its limits once you've seen Errol Morris' filmed investigation in the case. Now what about that thin blue line? Between good and evil, citizens and perpetrators? Where is it? Who draws it? Who blurs it? Are the interests of such people the same as yours, the citizen's? It all comes down to the question: Do you feel safe and protected by the law? Think again.

    Not to be confused with the British sitcom starring Rowan Atkinson and created by Ben Elton, this is a documentary feature film that featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew the title would be something to do with police or the law, and I was more intrigued with what I read about it. From director Errol Morris, this film documents and reconstructs the night of November 29th 1976, when during a traffic stop in Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood was murdered, the Dallas Police Department could only make an arrest after a sixteen year old Vidor, Texas resident gave information that he had told friends he was responsible for the crime. Young David Ray Harris did lead the police to the car driven from the scene of the crime and the 22 Short calibre revolver identified as the murder weapon, and the murderer was identified as twenty eight year old Ohio resident and hitchhiker Randall Dale Adams, who was living in a Dallas motel with his brother at the time. With the series of interviews from all involved in the investigation and re-enactments of the night in question, including witnesses, detectives and from Adams and Harris, and two attorneys make the case that more evidence points towards juvenile Harris then Adams who claims to be innocent and could face death under Texas law. The title of the film comes from a prosecutor comment that the police are "the thin blue line" separating society from "anarchy", also something to do with a poem by Rudyard Kipling and the colour of police uniform and their formation. Before watching this film I read that this film, made twelve years since the crime was committed, received a much more meaningful accolade than winning an Oscar or any other awards, following the release of the film the investigation was reignited and the case taken back to court, and the sentence for Adams was reversed. It is great to hear that a film could be so informative and force a retrial and the law to rethink their decision and verdict on a crime, Adams was indeed proved an innocent man and wrongly accused while Harris was executed with lethal injection in 2004 (for another unrelated crime). This is an engaging enough real life story about a murder and the routines of law enforcement and the legal system, the editing of going from interviews to re-enactments is well put together, and with some provocative stuff you do get a sense of unease sometimes, a terrific documentary. Very good!

    This is so powerful and well done! An unbelievable but true story. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen because it makes you both wonder and worry about how the justice system works. How many innocents are caught in the system and how difficult it must be when the authorities refuse to question their own judgment for fear of looking bad. Masterfully edited to hold your attention from start to finish with gripping interviews. Morris knows how to pace things just right. He doesn't belabor points that don't need it but doesn't rush through his interviews. Thank you Errol Morris for opening my eyes and feelings for the (probably many) innocents caught and still not freed. This is what a documentary should be.

    The Thin Blue Line (1988) **** (out of 4) This excellent documentary from Errol Morris features more drama than any crime movie that Hollywood could make up in their minds. This film traces the story of a murdered police officer and the arrest of Randall Dale Adams who was convicted of the crime even though most of the evidence pointed to David Harris. Through some questionable witnesses Adams was sentenced to a life term but Morris interviews him and Harris as well as the witnesses as he tries to tell what really happened. THE THIN BLUE LINE is about as perfect as a documentary can get and a lot of credit must go to Morris for the style he brought to the story. Not only do we get interviews for the majority of those involved, the director also adds some re-enactments and I really loved how he used newspaper listings to back up certain parts of the story. Just one example of this is that the men went to see a drive-in movie and Morris shows up the advertisement from the paper showing that the movies were playing. The real drama comes from the fact that everything seems to say that Adams is innocent and the only reason he was brought to trial was because people were lying. Just hearing from the "witnesses" as they talk about the lies they're telling is something so tense that you really couldn't get the same level of suspense from a made up movie. Knowing that real lives were involved in the story just makes it all the more personal and all the more dramatic. THE THIN BLUE LINE is perfectly crafted and there's no question that the story being told grabs you right from the start and never lets you go.

    The film has often been likened to Akira Kurosawa's fictive film- also about a murder, Rashomon. The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line. The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful.

    Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris, a young drifter, was initially arrested for the crime, but later testified that another man, Randall Adams, was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris, however, and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins, Adams has been in jail for 11 years, and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime. Using dramatic reconstructions and many eye-witness testimonies, Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a "Rashomon" styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints, the truth of the murder murky and shapeless, until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce, a pitiful picture begins to take shape: rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted, Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath, police incompetence is exposed, scapegoats are exonerated, corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined, the moral character of lawyers, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question, and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased, easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point: trust no one, test the gods, and keep probing until you find the truth. "The Thin Blue Line" was well received when it released in the late 1980s, but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish, noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film - talking heads, and overall aesthetic/approach would give rise to an entire documentary industry, influencing countless TV crime docs, court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting, powerful score by Philip Glass, which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose. Still, for a film purporting to "search for the truth", "The Thin Blue Line" is at times a thin work. Suspicious holes in Adams' memory are skirted over, and though the film places human faces on those ignored men and women who live on the fringes of society, either economically or psychologically, too little effort is put into delving into the lives of these characters. Subsequent writing on Harris (who has since been executed), for example, has demonstrated that he too was a victim, alcoholic and suicidal at the mere age of 11, and condemned to live with a violently abusive family. Also missing from the film is any trace of homosexuality, any trace of the psycho-sexual confusion these two men were experiencing and any understanding how their marginalization may have affected their sexuality. Indeed, psychopaths (both sexes tend to find psychopaths notoriously charming and sexy) are disproportionately bisexual, and many journalists and writers have since claimed that a bisexual or sexually confused Harris rejected Adams' sexual advances on the night of the murder, and that Adams is himself homosexual. But such avenues aren't explored in the film, nor are there any hints that Adams' sexuality played a role in the police convicting him (Texas was, and still is, renowned for its "Gay Persecution Laws"). Still, "The Thin Blue Line" is primarily interested in police corruption, and along these lines it works well. Morris makes it clear that the police failed to follow up on certain evidence merely because such evidence conflicted with the outcome they wanted to achieve. In other words, the police, like all human beings, engage in rationalizations, and tend to work backwards from their preconceived notions or expectations. Today, experts estimate that about ten thousand people in the US are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year (which is roughly between 5 and 14 percent of all convictions). Sixty four percent of the people exonerated of serious crimes had been misidentified (usually erroneous cross-racial identifications), fifteen percent had false confessions forced out of them, and 44 percent were subject to prosecution witnesses committing perjury. For a similar, and arguably better documentary covering this same topic, see "Murder on a Sunday Morning". 8/10  Though an influential and haunting documentary, time and countless imitators have rendered "The Thin Blue Line" somewhat slow and repetitive. Worth one viewing.

    This well-prepared and compelling documentary has one or two moments of brilliance that lift it above the average. The first is the reconstruction of the crime at the centre of the story. A nightmarish, abstracted scene that David Lynch might have created, this drama plays over and over again, never going beyond the perimeter of the camera's widest angle. It not only traps the event in a space but also in time. The second is the editorial care with which the director frames serial offender David Harris - only in the final shot of this man speaking do we see him reach up to scratch his face, revealing his handcuffs. The story itself is a blatant miscarriage of justice (postscripts record Adams' acquittal). The most compelling thing is to watch those involved speak about the event. The belligerent and defensive self-righteousness of bigoted Dallas officers and a self-important judge bloat the screen; the calm equanimity of defence lawyers, detective Sam Kittrell and even Adams himself are as powerful an advocate as the evidence itself. There is very little music but what there is is the stripped down, undulating underscoring of Philip Glass. It's occasionally difficult to make out exactly what's being said given the mix and the nature of the vernacular and accents but that's a minor point for a major document. 7/10

    I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised! This documentary tells the story of the murder of an innocent police officer from the different points of view of the people involved with the case. The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, and I actually felt nervous throughout the whole movie, as if I was watching a horror film! The whole case is extremely interesting, and all the twists and turns of it kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself trying to pick apart the case myself. The only problem I had with the movie, which is minor, is that it was told in a kind of fashion that had each "time period" (trial and accident) kind of mixed into each other, which is a creative way of telling the story, but I honestly don't like it in most movies because it can get very confusing. However, this doesn't really get too confusing and is still pretty easy to follow. With an ending I was not really left me speechless, I say this is a must see for anyone who is into trials or murders, likes documentaries, or is just looking for a good mystery type film (even though it is a documentary). It is one of the best documentaries I have actually seen, and so I give it 9/10 stars.

    I'm at a loss for words as to how dreadful and dreary this film is. This movie had the same pain level for me as Manos, Hands of Fate. I think the only explanation for its good reviews is that people have been led to believe that it's an artsy film and that if they don't appreciate it, then they're stupid and uncultured. Well, I can tell you that I appreciate an artfully done film and this is not one of them. It insults the intelligence of the viewer with overly long corny close-ups of mundane items such as police lights, a clock, and a milkshake on the ground. It's like being force-fed in slow motion. It moves at a geriatric pace, the music is insipid, and the crime-reenactment acting is straight out of the the junior-high play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it, I had to watch it in installments - it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up, the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated, succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawn-out painful experience. A hoakier, more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.

    Erroll Morris' groundbreaking documentary is an unlikely hybrid of investigative journalism and creative art, revisiting a Texas murder case compromised by legal errors and human ignorance. The film assembles a compelling presentation of facts, evidence, clues and speculation surrounding the arrest and conviction of (possibly) an innocent man, accused of murdering a Dallas cop. But watching it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, because all the available information points, convincingly, to another suspect, ex-con David Harris: the same witness whose testimony sent Randall Adams to death row. The film happened almost by accident: Morris became sidetracked while researching another project and began to investigate, on film, the case of Adams and Harris, two strangers whose paths crossed in Dallas one night in November of 1976. What the documentary maker discovered from his own methodical accumulation of clues, rumors, and offhand testimony was an overwhelming case against the young drifter David Harris, who clearly fingered Adams for his own crime. Morris was aided by a convincing and articulate defense presented by Adams himself, whose calm recitation of facts is often more hypnotic than the ominous Philip Glass music score. Morris reconstructs the case using old film footage, odd graphic digressions, dramatic reenactments, and interviews with almost everyone involved, including the likely true killer, who tacitly admits his guilt in the final scene. The film is more artfully arranged than most documentaries, and yet is so honest in its pursuit of the truth that it proved instrumental in correcting a miscarriage of justice (after it opened, the case against Harris was reopened, and eventually overturned). The director himself remains (as usual) all but invisible throughout the film, except for his trademark deadpan irreverence (the word blue in the title is colored red, and so forth). A tragic miscarriage of justice would seem an inappropriate source of laughs, but the streak of dark humor underlines the sometimes absurd workings of an imperfect legal system.

    The film has often been likened to Akira Kurosawa's fictive film- also about a murder, Rashomon. The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line. The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful.

    Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris, a young drifter, was initially arrested for the crime, but later testified that another man, Randall Adams, was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris, however, and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins, Adams has been in jail for 11 years, and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime. Using dramatic reconstructions and many eye-witness testimonies, Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a "Rashomon" styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints, the truth of the murder murky and shapeless, until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce, a pitiful picture begins to take shape: rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted, Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath, police incompetence is exposed, scapegoats are exonerated, corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined, the moral character of lawyers, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question, and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased, easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point: trust no one, test the gods, and keep probing until you find the truth. "The Thin Blue Line" was well received when it released in the late 1980s, but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish, noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film - talking heads, and overall aesthetic/approach would give rise to an entire documentary industry, influencing countless TV crime docs, court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting, powerful score by Philip Glass, which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose. Still, for a film purporting to "search for the truth", "The Thin Blue Line" is at times a thin work. Suspicious holes in Adams' memory are skirted over, and though the film places human faces on those ignored men and women who live on the fringes of society, either economically or psychologically, too little effort is put into delving into the lives of these characters. Subsequent writing on Harris (who has since been executed), for example, has demonstrated that he too was a victim, alcoholic and suicidal at the mere age of 11, and condemned to live with a violently abusive family. Also missing from the film is any trace of homosexuality, any trace of the psycho-sexual confusion these two men were experiencing and any understanding how their marginalization may have affected their sexuality. Indeed, psychopaths (both sexes tend to find psychopaths notoriously charming and sexy) are disproportionately bisexual, and many journalists and writers have since claimed that a bisexual or sexually confused Harris rejected Adams' sexual advances on the night of the murder, and that Adams is himself homosexual. But such avenues aren't explored in the film, nor are there any hints that Adams' sexuality played a role in the police convicting him (Texas was, and still is, renowned for its "Gay Persecution Laws"). Still, "The Thin Blue Line" is primarily interested in police corruption, and along these lines it works well. Morris makes it clear that the police failed to follow up on certain evidence merely because such evidence conflicted with the outcome they wanted to achieve. In other words, the police, like all human beings, engage in rationalizations, and tend to work backwards from their preconceived notions or expectations. Today, experts estimate that about ten thousand people in the US are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year (which is roughly between 5 and 14 percent of all convictions). Sixty four percent of the people exonerated of serious crimes had been misidentified (usually erroneous cross-racial identifications), fifteen percent had false confessions forced out of them, and 44 percent were subject to prosecution witnesses committing perjury. For a similar, and arguably better documentary covering this same topic, see "Murder on a Sunday Morning". 8/10  Though an influential and haunting documentary, time and countless imitators have rendered "The Thin Blue Line" somewhat slow and repetitive. Worth one viewing.

    This well-prepared and compelling documentary has one or two moments of brilliance that lift it above the average. The first is the reconstruction of the crime at the centre of the story. A nightmarish, abstracted scene that David Lynch might have created, this drama plays over and over again, never going beyond the perimeter of the camera's widest angle. It not only traps the event in a space but also in time. The second is the editorial care with which the director frames serial offender David Harris - only in the final shot of this man speaking do we see him reach up to scratch his face, revealing his handcuffs. The story itself is a blatant miscarriage of justice (postscripts record Adams' acquittal). The most compelling thing is to watch those involved speak about the event. The belligerent and defensive self-righteousness of bigoted Dallas officers and a self-important judge bloat the screen; the calm equanimity of defence lawyers, detective Sam Kittrell and even Adams himself are as powerful an advocate as the evidence itself. There is very little music but what there is is the stripped down, undulating underscoring of Philip Glass. It's occasionally difficult to make out exactly what's being said given the mix and the nature of the vernacular and accents but that's a minor point for a major document. 7/10

    I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised! This documentary tells the story of the murder of an innocent police officer from the different points of view of the people involved with the case. The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, and I actually felt nervous throughout the whole movie, as if I was watching a horror film! The whole case is extremely interesting, and all the twists and turns of it kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself trying to pick apart the case myself. The only problem I had with the movie, which is minor, is that it was told in a kind of fashion that had each "time period" (trial and accident) kind of mixed into each other, which is a creative way of telling the story, but I honestly don't like it in most movies because it can get very confusing. However, this doesn't really get too confusing and is still pretty easy to follow. With an ending I was not really left me speechless, I say this is a must see for anyone who is into trials or murders, likes documentaries, or is just looking for a good mystery type film (even though it is a documentary). It is one of the best documentaries I have actually seen, and so I give it 9/10 stars.

    I'm at a loss for words as to how dreadful and dreary this film is. This movie had the same pain level for me as Manos, Hands of Fate. I think the only explanation for its good reviews is that people have been led to believe that it's an artsy film and that if they don't appreciate it, then they're stupid and uncultured. Well, I can tell you that I appreciate an artfully done film and this is not one of them. It insults the intelligence of the viewer with overly long corny close-ups of mundane items such as police lights, a clock, and a milkshake on the ground. It's like being force-fed in slow motion. It moves at a geriatric pace, the music is insipid, and the crime-reenactment acting is straight out of the the junior-high play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it, I had to watch it in installments - it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up, the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated, succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawn-out painful experience. A hoakier, more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.

    Erroll Morris' groundbreaking documentary is an unlikely hybrid of investigative journalism and creative art, revisiting a Texas murder case compromised by legal errors and human ignorance. The film assembles a compelling presentation of facts, evidence, clues and speculation surrounding the arrest and conviction of (possibly) an innocent man, accused of murdering a Dallas cop. But watching it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, because all the available information points, convincingly, to another suspect, ex-con David Harris: the same witness whose testimony sent Randall Adams to death row. The film happened almost by accident: Morris became sidetracked while researching another project and began to investigate, on film, the case of Adams and Harris, two strangers whose paths crossed in Dallas one night in November of 1976. What the documentary maker discovered from his own methodical accumulation of clues, rumors, and offhand testimony was an overwhelming case against the young drifter David Harris, who clearly fingered Adams for his own crime. Morris was aided by a convincing and articulate defense presented by Adams himself, whose calm recitation of facts is often more hypnotic than the ominous Philip Glass music score. Morris reconstructs the case using old film footage, odd graphic digressions, dramatic reenactments, and interviews with almost everyone involved, including the likely true killer, who tacitly admits his guilt in the final scene. The film is more artfully arranged than most documentaries, and yet is so honest in its pursuit of the truth that it proved instrumental in correcting a miscarriage of justice (after it opened, the case against Harris was reopened, and eventually overturned). The director himself remains (as usual) all but invisible throughout the film, except for his trademark deadpan irreverence (the word blue in the title is colored red, and so forth). A tragic miscarriage of justice would seem an inappropriate source of laughs, but the streak of dark humor underlines the sometimes absurd workings of an imperfect legal system.

    A car thief. A juvenile. Someone hitching a ride. Police on patrol, a routine check. A dead officer, brutally shot - instant murder, on sight. There's bragging about a killing. And a memory gap. A search for a killer. Five witnesses. An unanimous verdict. No doubts whatsoever. A death sentence. Finally: an execution. - These at least are some facts of the case involving Randall Adams and David Harris, who met by chance at a Thanksgiving weekend on their way to Dallas. Components to form a larger picture, a picture that documentary filmmaker Errol Morris chose to redraw when he stumbled upon the case and grew more and more puzzled with its alarmingly unchallenged outcome before court. How does it all fit together, as the stories of the suspects obviously don't match? A private investigator himself at the time, Morris poses the right questions to everyone involved - Adams himself, Harris, the guy he hitched a ride from, the police, various detectives, witnesses, the attorneys. He also illustrates their versions on how the killing happened with contradicting re-enactments, usually a clear no-go for documentaries. Morris didn't know better what was expected of him at the time, but presenting the material cinematically - with close-ups, slow-motion and a haunting score by Phillip Glass - leaves a huge impact. However, except from his editing process, Morris lets the impressions stand as they are before the viewer without commenting himself. The result is intense and involving, spine-tingling, gripping and grizzly, and the last images will leave you shell-shocked and speechless. Criminals always lie, you know. Innocents usually tell the truth. Police should have an inkling in this regard. The riveting story of Randall Adams and David Harris doesn't end with the film. However, your trust in the Texan judiciary system might have reached its limits once you've seen Errol Morris' filmed investigation in the case. Now what about that thin blue line? Between good and evil, citizens and perpetrators? Where is it? Who draws it? Who blurs it? Are the interests of such people the same as yours, the citizen's? It all comes down to the question: Do you feel safe and protected by the law? Think again.

    Not to be confused with the British sitcom starring Rowan Atkinson and created by Ben Elton, this is a documentary feature film that featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew the title would be something to do with police or the law, and I was more intrigued with what I read about it. From director Errol Morris, this film documents and reconstructs the night of November 29th 1976, when during a traffic stop in Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood was murdered, the Dallas Police Department could only make an arrest after a sixteen year old Vidor, Texas resident gave information that he had told friends he was responsible for the crime. Young David Ray Harris did lead the police to the car driven from the scene of the crime and the 22 Short calibre revolver identified as the murder weapon, and the murderer was identified as twenty eight year old Ohio resident and hitchhiker Randall Dale Adams, who was living in a Dallas motel with his brother at the time. With the series of interviews from all involved in the investigation and re-enactments of the night in question, including witnesses, detectives and from Adams and Harris, and two attorneys make the case that more evidence points towards juvenile Harris then Adams who claims to be innocent and could face death under Texas law. The title of the film comes from a prosecutor comment that the police are "the thin blue line" separating society from "anarchy", also something to do with a poem by Rudyard Kipling and the colour of police uniform and their formation. Before watching this film I read that this film, made twelve years since the crime was committed, received a much more meaningful accolade than winning an Oscar or any other awards, following the release of the film the investigation was reignited and the case taken back to court, and the sentence for Adams was reversed. It is great to hear that a film could be so informative and force a retrial and the law to rethink their decision and verdict on a crime, Adams was indeed proved an innocent man and wrongly accused while Harris was executed with lethal injection in 2004 (for another unrelated crime). This is an engaging enough real life story about a murder and the routines of law enforcement and the legal system, the editing of going from interviews to re-enactments is well put together, and with some provocative stuff you do get a sense of unease sometimes, a terrific documentary. Very good!

    This is so powerful and well done! An unbelievable but true story. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen because it makes you both wonder and worry about how the justice system works. How many innocents are caught in the system and how difficult it must be when the authorities refuse to question their own judgment for fear of looking bad. Masterfully edited to hold your attention from start to finish with gripping interviews. Morris knows how to pace things just right. He doesn't belabor points that don't need it but doesn't rush through his interviews. Thank you Errol Morris for opening my eyes and feelings for the (probably many) innocents caught and still not freed. This is what a documentary should be.

    The Thin Blue Line (1988) **** (out of 4) This excellent documentary from Errol Morris features more drama than any crime movie that Hollywood could make up in their minds. This film traces the story of a murdered police officer and the arrest of Randall Dale Adams who was convicted of the crime even though most of the evidence pointed to David Harris. Through some questionable witnesses Adams was sentenced to a life term but Morris interviews him and Harris as well as the witnesses as he tries to tell what really happened. THE THIN BLUE LINE is about as perfect as a documentary can get and a lot of credit must go to Morris for the style he brought to the story. Not only do we get interviews for the majority of those involved, the director also adds some re-enactments and I really loved how he used newspaper listings to back up certain parts of the story. Just one example of this is that the men went to see a drive-in movie and Morris shows up the advertisement from the paper showing that the movies were playing. The real drama comes from the fact that everything seems to say that Adams is innocent and the only reason he was brought to trial was because people were lying. Just hearing from the "witnesses" as they talk about the lies they're telling is something so tense that you really couldn't get the same level of suspense from a made up movie. Knowing that real lives were involved in the story just makes it all the more personal and all the more dramatic. THE THIN BLUE LINE is perfectly crafted and there's no question that the story being told grabs you right from the start and never lets you go.

It insults the intelligence of the viewer with overly long corny close-ups of mundane items such as police lights, a clock, and a milkshake on the ground. It's like being force-fed in slow motion. It moves at a geriatric pace, the music is insipid, and the crime-reenactment acting is straight out of the the junior-high play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it, I had to watch it in installments - it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up, the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated, succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawn-out painful experience. A hoakier, more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.

    Erroll Morris' groundbreaking documentary is an unlikely hybrid of investigative journalism and creative art, revisiting a Texas murder case compromised by legal errors and human ignorance. The film assembles a compelling presentation of facts, evidence, clues and speculation surrounding the arrest and conviction of (possibly) an innocent man, accused of murdering a Dallas cop. But watching it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, because all the available information points, convincingly, to another suspect, ex-con David Harris: the same witness whose testimony sent Randall Adams to death row. The film happened almost by accident: Morris became sidetracked while researching another project and began to investigate, on film, the case of Adams and Harris, two strangers whose paths crossed in Dallas one night in November of 1976. What the documentary maker discovered from his own methodical accumulation of clues, rumors, and offhand testimony was an overwhelming case against the young drifter David Harris, who clearly fingered Adams for his own crime. Morris was aided by a convincing and articulate defense presented by Adams himself, whose calm recitation of facts is often more hypnotic than the ominous Philip Glass music score. Morris reconstructs the case using old film footage, odd graphic digressions, dramatic reenactments, and interviews with almost everyone involved, including the likely true killer, who tacitly admits his guilt in the final scene. The film is more artfully arranged than most documentaries, and yet is so honest in its pursuit of the truth that it proved instrumental in correcting a miscarriage of justice (after it opened, the case against Harris was reopened, and eventually overturned). The director himself remains (as usual) all but invisible throughout the film, except for his trademark deadpan irreverence (the word blue in the title is colored red, and so forth). A tragic miscarriage of justice would seem an inappropriate source of laughs, but the streak of dark humor underlines the sometimes absurd workings of an imperfect legal system.

    A car thief. A juvenile. Someone hitching a ride. Police on patrol, a routine check. A dead officer, brutally shot - instant murder, on sight. There's bragging about a killing. And a memory gap. A search for a killer. Five witnesses. An unanimous verdict. No doubts whatsoever. A death sentence. Finally: an execution. - These at least are some facts of the case involving Randall Adams and David Harris, who met by chance at a Thanksgiving weekend on their way to Dallas. Components to form a larger picture, a picture that documentary filmmaker Errol Morris chose to redraw when he stumbled upon the case and grew more and more puzzled with its alarmingly unchallenged outcome before court. How does it all fit together, as the stories of the suspects obviously don't match? A private investigator himself at the time, Morris poses the right questions to everyone involved - Adams himself, Harris, the guy he hitched a ride from, the police, various detectives, witnesses, the attorneys. He also illustrates their versions on how the killing happened with contradicting re-enactments, usually a clear no-go for documentaries. Morris didn't know better what was expected of him at the time, but presenting the material cinematically - with close-ups, slow-motion and a haunting score by Phillip Glass - leaves a huge impact. However, except from his editing process, Morris lets the impressions stand as they are before the viewer without commenting himself. The result is intense and involving, spine-tingling, gripping and grizzly, and the last images will leave you shell-shocked and speechless. Criminals always lie, you know. Innocents usually tell the truth. Police should have an inkling in this regard. The riveting story of Randall Adams and David Harris doesn't end with the film. However, your trust in the Texan judiciary system might have reached its limits once you've seen Errol Morris' filmed investigation in the case. Now what about that thin blue line? Between good and evil, citizens and perpetrators? Where is it? Who draws it? Who blurs it? Are the interests of such people the same as yours, the citizen's? It all comes down to the question: Do you feel safe and protected by the law? Think again.

    Not to be confused with the British sitcom starring Rowan Atkinson and created by Ben Elton, this is a documentary feature film that featured in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, I knew the title would be something to do with police or the law, and I was more intrigued with what I read about it. From director Errol Morris, this film documents and reconstructs the night of November 29th 1976, when during a traffic stop in Dallas police officer Robert W. Wood was murdered, the Dallas Police Department could only make an arrest after a sixteen year old Vidor, Texas resident gave information that he had told friends he was responsible for the crime. Young David Ray Harris did lead the police to the car driven from the scene of the crime and the 22 Short calibre revolver identified as the murder weapon, and the murderer was identified as twenty eight year old Ohio resident and hitchhiker Randall Dale Adams, who was living in a Dallas motel with his brother at the time. With the series of interviews from all involved in the investigation and re-enactments of the night in question, including witnesses, detectives and from Adams and Harris, and two attorneys make the case that more evidence points towards juvenile Harris then Adams who claims to be innocent and could face death under Texas law. The title of the film comes from a prosecutor comment that the police are "the thin blue line" separating society from "anarchy", also something to do with a poem by Rudyard Kipling and the colour of police uniform and their formation. Before watching this film I read that this film, made twelve years since the crime was committed, received a much more meaningful accolade than winning an Oscar or any other awards, following the release of the film the investigation was reignited and the case taken back to court, and the sentence for Adams was reversed. It is great to hear that a film could be so informative and force a retrial and the law to rethink their decision and verdict on a crime, Adams was indeed proved an innocent man and wrongly accused while Harris was executed with lethal injection in 2004 (for another unrelated crime). This is an engaging enough real life story about a murder and the routines of law enforcement and the legal system, the editing of going from interviews to re-enactments is well put together, and with some provocative stuff you do get a sense of unease sometimes, a terrific documentary. Very good!

    This is so powerful and well done! An unbelievable but true story. One of the best documentaries I've ever seen because it makes you both wonder and worry about how the justice system works. How many innocents are caught in the system and how difficult it must be when the authorities refuse to question their own judgment for fear of looking bad. Masterfully edited to hold your attention from start to finish with gripping interviews. Morris knows how to pace things just right. He doesn't belabor points that don't need it but doesn't rush through his interviews. Thank you Errol Morris for opening my eyes and feelings for the (probably many) innocents caught and still not freed. This is what a documentary should be.

    The Thin Blue Line (1988) **** (out of 4) This excellent documentary from Errol Morris features more drama than any crime movie that Hollywood could make up in their minds. This film traces the story of a murdered police officer and the arrest of Randall Dale Adams who was convicted of the crime even though most of the evidence pointed to David Harris. Through some questionable witnesses Adams was sentenced to a life term but Morris interviews him and Harris as well as the witnesses as he tries to tell what really happened. THE THIN BLUE LINE is about as perfect as a documentary can get and a lot of credit must go to Morris for the style he brought to the story. Not only do we get interviews for the majority of those involved, the director also adds some re-enactments and I really loved how he used newspaper listings to back up certain parts of the story. Just one example of this is that the men went to see a drive-in movie and Morris shows up the advertisement from the paper showing that the movies were playing. The real drama comes from the fact that everything seems to say that Adams is innocent and the only reason he was brought to trial was because people were lying. Just hearing from the "witnesses" as they talk about the lies they're telling is something so tense that you really couldn't get the same level of suspense from a made up movie. Knowing that real lives were involved in the story just makes it all the more personal and all the more dramatic. THE THIN BLUE LINE is perfectly crafted and there's no question that the story being told grabs you right from the start and never lets you go.

    The film has often been likened to Akira Kurosawa's fictive film- also about a murder, Rashomon. The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line. The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful.

    Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris, a young drifter, was initially arrested for the crime, but later testified that another man, Randall Adams, was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris, however, and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins, Adams has been in jail for 11 years, and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime. Using dramatic reconstructions and many eye-witness testimonies, Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a "Rashomon" styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints, the truth of the murder murky and shapeless, until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce, a pitiful picture begins to take shape: rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted, Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath, police incompetence is exposed, scapegoats are exonerated, corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined, the moral character of lawyers, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question, and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased, easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point: trust no one, test the gods, and keep probing until you find the truth. "The Thin Blue Line" was well received when it released in the late 1980s, but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish, noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film - talking heads, and overall aesthetic/approach would give rise to an entire documentary industry, influencing countless TV crime docs, court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting, powerful score by Philip Glass, which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose. Still, for a film purporting to "search for the truth", "The Thin Blue Line" is at times a thin work. Suspicious holes in Adams' memory are skirted over, and though the film places human faces on those ignored men and women who live on the fringes of society, either economically or psychologically, too little effort is put into delving into the lives of these characters. Subsequent writing on Harris (who has since been executed), for example, has demonstrated that he too was a victim, alcoholic and suicidal at the mere age of 11, and condemned to live with a violently abusive family. Also missing from the film is any trace of homosexuality, any trace of the psycho-sexual confusion these two men were experiencing and any understanding how their marginalization may have affected their sexuality. Indeed, psychopaths (both sexes tend to find psychopaths notoriously charming and sexy) are disproportionately bisexual, and many journalists and writers have since claimed that a bisexual or sexually confused Harris rejected Adams' sexual advances on the night of the murder, and that Adams is himself homosexual. But such avenues aren't explored in the film, nor are there any hints that Adams' sexuality played a role in the police convicting him (Texas was, and still is, renowned for its "Gay Persecution Laws"). Still, "The Thin Blue Line" is primarily interested in police corruption, and along these lines it works well. Morris makes it clear that the police failed to follow up on certain evidence merely because such evidence conflicted with the outcome they wanted to achieve. In other words, the police, like all human beings, engage in rationalizations, and tend to work backwards from their preconceived notions or expectations. Today, experts estimate that about ten thousand people in the US are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year (which is roughly between 5 and 14 percent of all convictions). Sixty four percent of the people exonerated of serious crimes had been misidentified (usually erroneous cross-racial identifications), fifteen percent had false confessions forced out of them, and 44 percent were subject to prosecution witnesses committing perjury. For a similar, and arguably better documentary covering this same topic, see "Murder on a Sunday Morning". 8/10  Though an influential and haunting documentary, time and countless imitators have rendered "The Thin Blue Line" somewhat slow and repetitive. Worth one viewing.

    This well-prepared and compelling documentary has one or two moments of brilliance that lift it above the average. The first is the reconstruction of the crime at the centre of the story. A nightmarish, abstracted scene that David Lynch might have created, this drama plays over and over again, never going beyond the perimeter of the camera's widest angle. It not only traps the event in a space but also in time. The second is the editorial care with which the director frames serial offender David Harris - only in the final shot of this man speaking do we see him reach up to scratch his face, revealing his handcuffs. The story itself is a blatant miscarriage of justice (postscripts record Adams' acquittal). The most compelling thing is to watch those involved speak about the event. The belligerent and defensive self-righteousness of bigoted Dallas officers and a self-important judge bloat the screen; the calm equanimity of defence lawyers, detective Sam Kittrell and even Adams himself are as powerful an advocate as the evidence itself. There is very little music but what there is is the stripped down, undulating underscoring of Philip Glass. It's occasionally difficult to make out exactly what's being said given the mix and the nature of the vernacular and accents but that's a minor point for a major document. 7/10

    I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised! This documentary tells the story of the murder of an innocent police officer from the different points of view of the people involved with the case. The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, and I actually felt nervous throughout the whole movie, as if I was watching a horror film! The whole case is extremely interesting, and all the twists and turns of it kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself trying to pick apart the case myself. The only problem I had with the movie, which is minor, is that it was told in a kind of fashion that had each "time period" (trial and accident) kind of mixed into each other, which is a creative way of telling the story, but I honestly don't like it in most movies because it can get very confusing. However, this doesn't really get too confusing and is still pretty easy to follow. With an ending I was not really left me speechless, I say this is a must see for anyone who is into trials or murders, likes documentaries, or is just looking for a good mystery type film (even though it is a documentary). It is one of the best documentaries I have actually seen, and so I give it 9/10 stars.

    I'm at a loss for words as to how dreadful and dreary this film is. This movie had the same pain level for me as Manos, Hands of Fate.

THE THIN BLUE LINE is perfectly crafted and there's no question that the story being told grabs you right from the start and never lets you go.

    The film has often been likened to Akira Kurosawa's fictive film- also about a murder, Rashomon. The problem with that analogy is that, in the Kurosawa film, one has no basis by which to know which of the several versions of the killing are correct. In The Thin Blue Line- both from the many tellings and the way Morris presents them, it's obvious that Adams is innocent and Harris is guilty. The only Rashomon like thing is the fact that re-enacted tellings of the shooting all vary, from the two principals, to the cops' claims, to those made by the assorted witnesses who, in actuality, saw nothing. The fact that the many re-enactments are at odds with Morris's clear view that Adams was innocent is a minor failing of the film, and shows Morris was still trying to live up to the dictum that a documentary has to be (or try to be) objective in its presentation of its facts. But, in a case where the evidence is so incontrovertibly one-sided, is such an effort worth it, dramatically or aesthetically? I think not, and films like Barbara Kopple's Harlan County, USA are proof of my claim. The title of the film comes from the old notion that a thin line of cops (hence the blue) is all that saves civilization from its own worst instincts. The judge who sentenced Adams, when recounting the summation of the DA, tells how he almost teared up at hearing the use of the term. The film, however, turns the title on its side and shows how that same line can be used as a tool for injustice, suppression of evidence, and the oppression of innocents. And it is this perversion of 'justice' that can hasten society's fall far more than the mere absence of that thin blue line. The Thin Blue Line is both a landmark and important film, but those claims are not equivalent to calling it a great film. Arguments can be made, in which case a claim for near greatness may be apt, but not greatness. Compared to the documentaries of Morris's friend and mentor, Werner Herzog, The Thin Blue Line still has a far greater affinity to the sort of straightforward documentaries to be found on PBS shows like Frontline. However, the fact that it did great things- freed an innocent man and held up the so-called justice system to the greater scrutiny it deserves (be it for capital crimes or those as trivial as phony traffic tickets issued to meet monthly quotas)- is indisputable, and that makes it an important film. From a cinematic perspective, the best thing this still rather linear film did was bridge Morris's path from his early quirky documentaries to his later, greater films, like The Fog Of War, which is more clearly in the Herzogian mode. And, for that trajectory, alone, the world of cinema should be grateful.

    Errol Morris' "The Thin Blue Line" documents the 1976 murder of Dallas police officer Robert Wood. David Harris, a young drifter, was initially arrested for the crime, but later testified that another man, Randall Adams, was actually responsible for the murder. Adams claimed to know nothing about the murder. Local authorities believed Harris, however, and Adams was eventually charged and given the death sentence. As the film begins, Adams has been in jail for 11 years, and Harris is serving time for an unrelated crime. Using dramatic reconstructions and many eye-witness testimonies, Morris' documentary dives headlong into the case. It's a "Rashomon" styled parade of conflicting testimonies and overlapping subjective viewpoints, the truth of the murder murky and shapeless, until things begin to focus. When the crime begins to coalesce, a pitiful picture begins to take shape: rampant police corruption led to Adams being falsely convicted, Harris emerges as a juvenile psychopath, police incompetence is exposed, scapegoats are exonerated, corroborating evidence and testimonies are undermined, the moral character of lawyers, psychiatrists, law enforcement officers and expert witnesses is called into question, and even the testimonies of regular civilians are seen to be wholly biased, easily swayed by personal desires for money and fame. The film's point: trust no one, test the gods, and keep probing until you find the truth. "The Thin Blue Line" was well received when it released in the late 1980s, but it would be a number of years before its influence on the documentary genre would become apparent. Morris' dramatic reconstructions of the crime  filmed in nightmarish, noirish hues and resemblant of a David Lynch film - talking heads, and overall aesthetic/approach would give rise to an entire documentary industry, influencing countless TV crime docs, court TV stations and investigative programmes. Adding weight to Morris' visuals is a mounting, powerful score by Philip Glass, which pulls portentously down on the picture like a hang man's noose. Still, for a film purporting to "search for the truth", "The Thin Blue Line" is at times a thin work. Suspicious holes in Adams' memory are skirted over, and though the film places human faces on those ignored men and women who live on the fringes of society, either economically or psychologically, too little effort is put into delving into the lives of these characters. Subsequent writing on Harris (who has since been executed), for example, has demonstrated that he too was a victim, alcoholic and suicidal at the mere age of 11, and condemned to live with a violently abusive family. Also missing from the film is any trace of homosexuality, any trace of the psycho-sexual confusion these two men were experiencing and any understanding how their marginalization may have affected their sexuality. Indeed, psychopaths (both sexes tend to find psychopaths notoriously charming and sexy) are disproportionately bisexual, and many journalists and writers have since claimed that a bisexual or sexually confused Harris rejected Adams' sexual advances on the night of the murder, and that Adams is himself homosexual. But such avenues aren't explored in the film, nor are there any hints that Adams' sexuality played a role in the police convicting him (Texas was, and still is, renowned for its "Gay Persecution Laws"). Still, "The Thin Blue Line" is primarily interested in police corruption, and along these lines it works well. Morris makes it clear that the police failed to follow up on certain evidence merely because such evidence conflicted with the outcome they wanted to achieve. In other words, the police, like all human beings, engage in rationalizations, and tend to work backwards from their preconceived notions or expectations. Today, experts estimate that about ten thousand people in the US are wrongfully convicted of serious crimes each year (which is roughly between 5 and 14 percent of all convictions). Sixty four percent of the people exonerated of serious crimes had been misidentified (usually erroneous cross-racial identifications), fifteen percent had false confessions forced out of them, and 44 percent were subject to prosecution witnesses committing perjury. For a similar, and arguably better documentary covering this same topic, see "Murder on a Sunday Morning". 8/10  Though an influential and haunting documentary, time and countless imitators have rendered "The Thin Blue Line" somewhat slow and repetitive. Worth one viewing.

    This well-prepared and compelling documentary has one or two moments of brilliance that lift it above the average. The first is the reconstruction of the crime at the centre of the story. A nightmarish, abstracted scene that David Lynch might have created, this drama plays over and over again, never going beyond the perimeter of the camera's widest angle. It not only traps the event in a space but also in time. The second is the editorial care with which the director frames serial offender David Harris - only in the final shot of this man speaking do we see him reach up to scratch his face, revealing his handcuffs. The story itself is a blatant miscarriage of justice (postscripts record Adams' acquittal). The most compelling thing is to watch those involved speak about the event. The belligerent and defensive self-righteousness of bigoted Dallas officers and a self-important judge bloat the screen; the calm equanimity of defence lawyers, detective Sam Kittrell and even Adams himself are as powerful an advocate as the evidence itself. There is very little music but what there is is the stripped down, undulating underscoring of Philip Glass. It's occasionally difficult to make out exactly what's being said given the mix and the nature of the vernacular and accents but that's a minor point for a major document. 7/10

    I went into this movie not knowing what to expect, and boy was I surprised! This documentary tells the story of the murder of an innocent police officer from the different points of view of the people involved with the case. The whole movie has a very creepy feel to it, and I actually felt nervous throughout the whole movie, as if I was watching a horror film! The whole case is extremely interesting, and all the twists and turns of it kept me on the edge of my seat. I found myself trying to pick apart the case myself. The only problem I had with the movie, which is minor, is that it was told in a kind of fashion that had each "time period" (trial and accident) kind of mixed into each other, which is a creative way of telling the story, but I honestly don't like it in most movies because it can get very confusing. However, this doesn't really get too confusing and is still pretty easy to follow. With an ending I was not really left me speechless, I say this is a must see for anyone who is into trials or murders, likes documentaries, or is just looking for a good mystery type film (even though it is a documentary). It is one of the best documentaries I have actually seen, and so I give it 9/10 stars.

    I'm at a loss for words as to how dreadful and dreary this film is. This movie had the same pain level for me as Manos, Hands of Fate. I think the only explanation for its good reviews is that people have been led to believe that it's an artsy film and that if they don't appreciate it, then they're stupid and uncultured. Well, I can tell you that I appreciate an artfully done film and this is not one of them. It insults the intelligence of the viewer with overly long corny close-ups of mundane items such as police lights, a clock, and a milkshake on the ground. It's like being force-fed in slow motion. It moves at a geriatric pace, the music is insipid, and the crime-reenactment acting is straight out of the the junior-high play. Many times I wondered if the crew of this film were on serious drugs. I had to watch this for a class assignment and to get through it, I had to watch it in installments - it was that painful to endure. The entire case could have been summed up, the miscarriage of justice exhibited in a much more sophisticated, succinct manner. Instead it was just one long drawn-out painful experience. A hoakier, more godawful production I've yet to see. Do yourself a favor and read the book. It's better and much more interesting than this dung heap of a film.

    Erroll Morris' groundbreaking documentary is an unlikely hybrid of investigative journalism and creative art, revisiting a Texas murder case compromised by legal errors and human ignorance. The film assembles a compelling presentation of facts, evidence, clues and speculation surrounding the arrest and conviction of (possibly) an innocent man, accused of murdering a Dallas cop. But watching it can sometimes be a frustrating experience, because all the available information points, convincingly, to another suspect, ex-con David Harris: the same witness whose testimony sent Randall Adams to death row. The film happened almost by accident: Morris became sidetracked while researching another project and began to investigate, on film, the case of Adams and Harris, two strangers whose paths crossed in Dallas one night in November of 1976. What the documentary maker discovered from his own methodical accumulation of clues, rumors, and offhand testimony was an overwhelming case against the young drifter David Harris, who clearly fingered Adams for his own crime. Morris was aided by a convincing and articulate defense presented by Adams himself, whose calm recitation of facts is often more hypnotic than the ominous Philip Glass music score. Morris reconstructs the case using old film footage, odd graphic digressions, dramatic reenactments, and interviews with almost everyone involved, including the likely true killer, who tacitly admits his guilt in the final scene. The film is more artfully arranged than most documentaries, and yet is so honest in its pursuit of the truth that it proved instrumental in correcting a miscarriage of justice (after it opened, the case against Harris was reopened, and eventually overturned). The director himself remains (as usual) all but invisible throughout the film, except for his trademark deadpan irreverence (the word blue in the title is colored red, and so forth). A tragic miscarriage of justice would seem an inappropriate source of laughs, but the streak of dark humor underlines the sometimes absurd workings of an imperfect legal system.
