    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    A classic because of its social tone for its time

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU

    Just the title of the movie would and/or should indicate the subject matter of the movie. (As a boy of ten in 1956, I guessed that it was about Texas, and my guess was verified.) This spectacle, based on Edna Ferber's best-seller had quite an all-star cast-composed of Rock Hudson, Elizabeth Taylor, James Dean (who died in 1955 shortly before the completion of the movie's filming), Carroll Baker, Chill Wills, Sal Mineo, Earl Holliman, Dennis Hopper, and Mercedes MacCambridge (who sometimes seemed more masculine than a lot of men)-and certainly contributed to it success. Of course, the producer George Stevens was definitely successful. Therefore, Warner Brothers should be proud of this, one of the studio's most outstanding productions. It follows well a quarter-of-a-century time frame, all the way from about 1925 to circa 1950, dealing well with familial difficulties, acceptable and unacceptable marriages, tragedies of WWII and prejudice toward the Mexicans in Texas. (Of course, Jordan Benedict, played by Hudson, was not, to say the very least, a bit fond of Jett Rink, played by Dean.) For the most part, though not completely, Dean, Hudson and Taylor were "aged" well in this movie. There was in this movie a fair share of romance, outstanding dramatic action, and occasional modern-day western action. The scenery was beautiful, in its own Texas way, with the dusty dry ground. For those who like downtown Dallas, it was drawing. It should have won the Best Picture Award, but sadly it did not. It had all the elements of a great production. Personally, I believe it is a must-see.

    This excellent 1956 film touches on many social issues-bigotry, the rights of women, alcoholism, a changing America, wealth, greed, you name it. A near perfect chemistry existed between Elizabeth Taylor and Rock Hudson. Mercedes McCambridge, as Hudson's sister, represents the dying breed of a Texas woman. Strong, gritty and bigoted along the way, McCambridge was only on screen here for about 40 minutes, but memorable here as she garnered a best supporting actress nomination. James Dean, always great, personified what wealth does to someone. Footnotes here include: Both Hudson and Dean were up for best actor for this film. Neither won. Hudson was in 2 pictures that year that gave us a best supporting actress nominee: McCambridge in this one, and winner Dorothy Malone in "Written on the Wind." Sal Mineo, who appeared with Dean the year before in "Rebel Without A Cause," shows up in the picture as a minority soldier and hardly uttered a word. The cinematography is absolutely sprawling and justice was certainly done to Edna Ferber's book.

    Giant 1956 A movie to see even with its flaws. Movie of that era, and stars of that era are never to return. They seemed bigger than life which coincidently was also the movie's title. This was a time when adult men get up for hostess at the dinner table; this was a time when there was no gender confusion - women know how to be women and men would be men. You see a pristine Elizabeth Taylor and brawny handsome Rod Hudson. They make a very attractive couple on screen. Robert Mitchum was also considered but would be a bad choice because he lacks the appeal of Hudson to match the beautiful Taylor. The early scenes were the best, Taylor flirting with Hudson at her father's house when he came to purchase her prized stallion. In contrast to the rich verdant fields of Maryland, the Texas ranch where Hudson returned to with new bride Leslie (Taylor) appears almost desolate, absent of any vegetation and strewn with rolling moss. But Taylor did not seem to mind and looked genuinely determined to make a new life there. Hudson's Bick was laconic,actually a simply man, steeped in tradition. His sudden transformation to total acceptance of the "lower" Mexican class was not apparent. Director Stevens could have used Taylor's successful effort in providing health care to poor Mexicans as a boon for change in Bick. That did not happen. Taylor is in her full glory here. Lively,eastern-cultured turned Texan, she is smoldering and lifts the whole story. How would Grace Kelly do had she been casted no one knows. But I personally think a tall cool blonde is not what is needed here. Now about Dean, never understand his dislikes of the Benedicts. The movie does little in explaining that conflict. If Dean is envious of Bick he is doing little to get out of the mode he is in. Not until he inherits a piece of land bequeath to him does he finds incentive to improve himself. But then he only manifests it in front of Taylor and no one else. Why was Dean's role necessary ? It only comes to light the day after I saw "Giant". Dean was there to draw a difference. He is destroyed by his sudden riches. Bick, on the other, laments the past when his family ruled a cattle empire, but he adapts to the future and makes peace with himself, even when he lost a fight with a bigoted ex- army cafe owner. That, my friend is priceless. Something needed to be said about other considerable talents here: the great Rod Taylor no relation to Elizebath used only sparingly in the first scene. He could have provided some counter punches when Hudson comes to steal his love interest. Sal Mineo as grown-up Angel whom Taylor helped when he was a sick baby had barely any speaking part. Yet overall you want to see "Giant" for its grandeur and big-ness, and to appreciate a past era and the fledgling, social, economic change for that time, which would give way to the psychedelic years of the 60's and beyond.

    The epitome of the Hollywood epic soap opera, immortalised by the premature death late in the production by its enigmatic star James Dean. Dean plays a brooding ranch-hand bequeathed a parcel of supposedly arid land upon the death of his employer, but rather than exchange it for a handsome sum, turns it into a profitable oil interest much to the chagrin of his former employer's son (and heir to the estate) Hudson. Elizabeth Taylor co-stars as Hudson's wife (affecting a reasonable southern drawl), while notable supporting cast features Dennis Hopper and Carroll Baker as the Hudson/Taylor brood (nevermind the age issues), and Chill Wills, Rod Taylor and the very young Sal Mineo have supporting roles of various importance. I'm not sure if "Giant" would've become so revered had it not been for the fatal accident that claimed Dean's life before its release, suffice to say it's best seen with an intermission to digest the mammoth three hours plus duration. Overall the story is engaging and the cast is attractive, but the execution is all show and little substance.

    The two disk DVD, by Warner Brothers, is a pretty good package. Disk Two has two hour long documentaries on the film, called Memories Of Giant and Return To Giant. Both are making of films. Both include interviews with surviving members of the cast and crew, mostly minor players like the director's son, George Stevens Jr., and actors like Jane Withers, Earl Holliman, and Carroll Baker, with archival footage of Hudson. There are several theatrical trailers for the film, a TV special of the film's New York and Hollywood premieres, and the Gig Young TV show, Behind The Cameras, about life on the set. Disk One has the film, broken at its intermission, into two parts, the first of which is one side one, and the second on side two. There is also an Introduction to the film by George Stevens, Jr.; a series of interviews with other filmmakers on their thoughts about George Stevens, as a filmmaker; and then an audio commentary track by Stevens, Jr., film critic Stephen Farber, and the film's screenwriter, Ivan Moffat. Of the three, this bland commentary only has moments of interest when Moffat, who was actually part of the film's creation, speaks. Steven, Jr. seems to busy being in awe of his father's work, and Farber just seems happy to be getting recognized as a film critic. Some good points that pop up in the commentary (at over three hours in length, even a few chimps would entertain a few times, eh?) are discussions of why Stevens abjured Cinemascope, so he could have height in his films, as well as width, and why the two Luz Benedicts seem to be obsessive over Jett Rink. Giant is not a film that will stick long in one's memory, and it is not a film of any real political nor historical import, despite the claims made by many of the people featured in the bonus features of the DVD. It's a well made soap opera, a grand entertainment that has a few moments, in its sprawl, that stand out. In brief, it is that old saw: a good solid movie that one turns to when down, and in need of relief from reality. It will make a lousy, rainy afternoon a little bit more enjoyable. After all, rain does have its charms, even if little of the wet will quench the soul, much less mind.

    I knew that this was the last film to star the iconic James Dean before his tragic death at the age of twenty four in a car crash, and it was good to know it was featured in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and besides him it had a great cast list, so I had to see it, from director Oscar winning, and Golden Globe director George Stevens (Swing Time, Gunga Din, Shane, The Greatest Story Ever Told). Basically in the early 1920's in Texas head of the rich Benedict ranching family Jordan 'Bick' Benedict Jr. (Oscar nominated Rock Hudson) goes to buy a stud horse in Maryland, and there he meets and gets close to socialite Leslie Lynnton (Dame Elizabeth Taylor) who was originally to marry diplomat Sir David Karfrey (The Birds' Rod Taylor) but breaks off the engagement to marry Bick. They return the family ranch Reata in Texas to start a family life, Bick's sister Luz (Oscar nominated Mercedes McCambridge) keeps the household in order but resents Leslie and tries to intimidate her, and there is also trouble with Luz's worker Jett Rink (Oscar nominated Dean) hopes to find his own fortune and has secret love for Leslie. Luz dies suddenly after being bucked by the purchased horse War Winds, and in her will Jett is given the plot of land within the Benedict ranch, and he refuses to sell it back to Bick, while Leslie over time gives birth to children, twins Jordan 'Jordy' Benedict III (Dennis Hopper) and Judy (Fran Bennett), and younger daughter Luz II (Carroll Baker). Jett makes his fortune when he discovers oil and drills for it and he boasts about it to the Benedicts, and Bick punches him when making rude sexual remarks and they have a fight as well, and as World War II goes on Bick refuses any offer to drill with Jett and wants to remain a cattle rancher. With the Benedict children grown up they all want to pursue somewhat different paths causing tensions, with Jordy wanting to be a doctor rather than running the ranch, Judy wants to study animal husbandry at Texas Tech rather than attending finishing school in Switzerland, and these decisions made Bick gives in to a deal with Jett to allow oil production on his land to help the war effort. Both Bick and Jett develop problems with alcoholism, and Luz II starts to flirt with Jett, and as expected the family become much wealthier than before, so much so that they can afford a large swimming pool next to the house. The war ends, but the Benedict-Rink rivalry continues, and it gets worse when Luz II is revealed to be dating the older Jett, and Jordy tries to fight him when his Mexican-American wife Juana (Elsa C&aacute;rdenas) is given racist insults by the staff Jett employs, but he only ends up getting thrown out. There is a point when Bick wants to end the rivalry with a fistfight, but facing Jett he cannot come to doing it, and Jett just ends up drunk and falling over to sleep, and after the party guests leave Luz II finds him talking to himself about his sexual interests about her mother. The next day the family, apart from Jordy, drive to have a normal dinner without the feeling of a rich lifestyle in a diner, and with proprietor Sarge (Mickey Simpson) racially insulting again directed at an old Mexican man they all end up in a fight, most of the family are disgusted by Bick's behaviour, but Leslie applauds him standing up to bullies and she had some fun for one, and the last few scenes see Bick and Leslie with their grandchildren and reflecting on their family life. Also starring Sal Mineo as Angel Obreg&oacute;n II, Jane Withers as Vashti Snythe, Chill Wills as Uncle Bawley, Judith Evelyn as Mrs. Nancy Lynnton, Paul Fix as Dr. Horace Lynnton, Alexander Scourby as Old Polo, Earl Holliman as 'Bob' Dace and Robert Nichols as Mort 'Pinky' Snythe. Hudson is charming and manly, Taylor is beautiful and sweet, and Dean does well acting and looking older than his real age, I agree one of the best sequences is him striking oil, the film has no plot as such, it is simply seeing the life of a family throughout the years, all their happy moments, their relationships, their important and meaningful decisions, their heartache and traumas, and experiencing all emotions you can think of, it could be seen as a melodrama almost, it is a little long, but an enjoyable epic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Costume Design, Best Film Editing, Best Music for Dimitri Tiomkin, Best Writing, Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama. Dame Elizabeth Taylor was number 77, and Dean number 64 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Taylor was number 7 on Britain's Finest Actresses, Rock Hudson was number 79, Dean number 27, and Taylor number 13 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, Taylor was number 11 on The 50 Greatest British Actresses, Taylor was number 7 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Women, Dean was number 50 on The World's Greatest Actor, Dean was number 18 on 100 Years, 100 Stars  Men, and Dean was number 22 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!

    'Giant' is the feel-good George Stevens soap opera based on the Edna Ferber novel of the same name. Ferber may have projected some of her own liberal sensibilities on the story of her protagonist, Texas patriarch Jordan 'Bick' Benedict. The Hollywood screenwriters then went a step further, exaggerating the protagonist's liberal bent and turning the novel's more complex antagonist, into a doomed alcoholic. Benedict is a rich Texas rancher played by a young Rock Hudson, who travels to Maryland to purchase a stud horse and while there meets and courts Leslie Lynnton (Elizabeth Taylor), a socialite from a very well-off Maryland family. In the blink of an eye, a courtship develops and before you know it, Bick takes Leslie back to Reatta, the family ranch, as his wife. The first third of 'Giant' is quite slow-moving, focusing on the conflict between Bick's sister, Luz (who basically runs the ranch) and Leslie, whom Luz feels is attempting to usurp her long-held position as head honcho. Luz unfortunately is killed while riding the horse which Bick purchased back in Maryland. Things don't end there, as Luz cedes her small amount of property to Jett, her loyal ranch hand. Bick attempts to buy the property from Jett but he decides to hold on to it. At the midpoint, Jett discovers oil on his land and arrogantly returns to the Benedict ranch proclaiming that he's now rich, makes a crude sexual remark to Leslie, which leads to Bick and Jett exchanging blows. One of the primary weaknesses of the 'Giant' screenplay is that you expect the conflict between Bick and Jett to develop exponentially, but that never occurs. Rather, domestic discord in the Benedict household becomes the primary focus of the second half of Act II. Bick's inflexibility drives Leslie to return to Maryland for a break with the children. But underneath Bick is not so bad all the time, as he shows up unannounced in Maryland, to woo Leslie back. Bick still has a hard time accepting the idea that his son Jordy doesn't want to succeed him running the ranch and really wants to be a doctor. Similarly, Leslie would like daughter Judy to go to a fancy finishing school in Switzerland but she would rather take animal husbandry at Texas Tech. The parents learn an important lesson about tolerance, end up giving in, and allow both Jordy and Judy to pursue their career goals. The conflict between Bick and Jett is further delayed when Bick finally agrees to give up the oil rights to his land at Jett's behest. This makes Bick a multi-millionaire as evidenced by the new swimming pool on their property. Jett finally comes back in the picture when Bick and Leslie are confronted with the possibility that he may now become their son-in-law due to daughter Luz's new found infatuation with the tycoon. The Benedicts attend a gala for Jett where Jordy becomes enraged that his new Mexican-American wife is barred from getting a facial by Jett's employees at a salon in the hotel where they're staying. Jett arrives at the dinner hall intoxicated and is confronted by Bick, who picks a fight over Jett punching and throwing Jordy outside earlier, incensed over his wife's treatment. After Jett knocks Bick down in front of everybody at the dinner, they agree to meet in a stock room and duke it out. But Bick walks out when he sees that Jett is in no condition to fight him. Jett is so intoxicated that he passes out on the dais and is unable to give his acceptance speech. Hours later, after everyone has left, he suddenly wakes up, still in a drunken stupor. Luz is there to see him pining away for Leslie and realizes that he was only using her as a substitute for her mother, who he always desired, but never attained. The fall of Jett at film's end proves to be a 'Giant' undoing. The Hollywood screenwriters end up 'punishing' their antagonist by turning Jett into a pathetic alcoholic who in effect wins a Pyrrhic victory against Bick (this in contradiction to Feber's more complex portrait of the antagonist). Instead of making Jett into a guy who likes himself and utilizing his position of power to get his way, he becomes a laughingstock in front of all his peers (Orson Welles uses a similar strategy to slander William Randolph Hearst in 'Citizen Kane', by portraying him as pathetic and dissolute). The Hollywood scenarists now must improbably place their protagonist on a pedestal by having Bick fight the bigoted proprietor at a segregated diner. Even though he loses the fight, Leslie proclaims him a winner for sticking up for an old Mexican man and his family who the proprietor attempts to throw out. Yes, there may have been a few enlightened oil tycoons and ranchers who believed in civil rights for minorities in a 1950s Texas, but they were probably few and far between. Bick becomes a stand-in for the wish-fulfilling views of Hollywood, but not Ferber, whose view of both Bick and Jett, are decidedly more complex. 'Giant' certainly wins points for speaking out about prejudice against Mexican-Americans, not exactly a popular cause at the time the film was made (unfortunately, blacks do not get the same treatment here). Despite this, Giant meanders as Jett unfortunately never becomes a worthy adversary to Bick, leading to a much needed life and death struggle. Jett remains a weak antagonist even in the novel, as Ferber never was able to successfully integrate the character into the Benedict sagahe pretty much remains a peripheral figure throughout. Finally, I'll conclude this review by judging James Dean the winner in the make-up department. Unlike Hudson and Taylor (who have a sprinkle of gray in their hair to age them), Dean actually looks older with a mustache and hair parted and cut to suggest a thinning coiffure.

    Decades before the Ewing oil barons redefined the word "greed" on the TV screens in "Dallas" and half a century before P.T. Anderson dug even deeper in "There Will Be Blood" there was George Stevens' "Giant". The epic saga clocks in at over 200 minutes, and there's of course the mentioned oil drama, where people get rich and drown in their greed, but this is just one of the many facets of Edna Ferber's rich novel, and all of them made it to the screen in this multi-layered gem. "Giant" also offers a lot of social commentary on dubious morals, racism and tolerance, it shows men being men and women standing up, it's about national and personal pride and generations growing up and learning to live with each other despite their apparent differences. It had something to say back then, and still has today. On the side of such calibers like Rock Hudson and Liz Taylor "Giant" furthermore features James Dean in his very last performance, as a young cowboy first and then as the embittered aged millionaire, whose money cannot buy everything. The cast, among them as well Rod Taylor and the young Dennis Hopper, add authenticity, which becomes perfected due to the characters' period costumes, the strong accent, alongside the magnificently shot Texas scenery, and an art direction that really sets you right into a story of epic proportions spanning several decades. Characters grow up, live, and change over the years, and we get the chance to observe them in just three hours. Granted, "Giant" has a few cheesy moments here and there and it walks a fine line between soap opera and monumental depth, but then again: This is Texas in all its glory, and George Stevens paid tribute to that visually and by portraying characters deeply rooted in the soil they came from. And by raising necessary issues about Texas - past and future.

    This 200 minute monster turns up on cable every now and then, and it always reaffirms my original opinion. How did this get made, and why would anyone think it requires over three hours? The art direction, sets and lighting are all so humorously fake, as bad as the acting. After some local color shots early in the film, it goes mostly indoors with a lot of languorous suffering and unhappiness. Is it an amazing, dense epic that requires its 3 hours? Not a chance. Your time is wasted by things like a caf&eacute; fight scene where Rock gets in a fistfight with the racist owner. It goes on relentlessly, with one facial meat-punch after another as these two fly over tables and chairs and not one person in the place gets up to stop it or flee. After maybe three solid minutes of this poorly enacted brutality, we cut to Rock at home in a family scene with a light bruise on his face. Anyone knows that a few face punches leads to stitches and probably broken hand bones, but he is chuckling with his baby. Well, that is but one example of the weird surrealism of this stinker.

    This is of course a classic. All films with James Dean are. But this is a social classic about the emergence of the USA as a first rank industrial power. The Benedicts are one of these super big families in Texas who bought Mexican land for a pittance, mind you something like a dime or a quarter per acre and bunches like half a million, one million or more acres. In other words they were the few rich people who had that kind of cash under their hands and who were able to buy a kingdom for the price of a pigsty. The last male heir of the family marries a wealthy girl from Washington DC or that vicinity, a girl with an education and a life style who has learned how to be genteel and at the same time empathetic to other people. When she arrives in Texas she is at once shocked by the way Mexican servants are treated and later by the way Mexican servants and workers are living in misery and squalor with absolutely no care from the rich white people from the super enormously big ranch. She is shocked by a baby who is sick and bound to die just because the doctor of the white people is not supposed to take care of the Mexican servants of the estate. She will bring a Mexican doctor later on for them. Equal but separate and with the means each group has. The poor are equal but poor, so they die young and they are looked down upon as if they were some kind of rattle snakes. She is also surprised by the fact that the husband goes along with the Texan tradition that women are not in any way taking part in politics, business and the managing of the ranch. She runs into the sister who defends her house and kitchen prerogatives, and she does so well that she will exhaust, mistreat and maim the wife's horse who will of course get rid of her in the good old bronco style and she will die by diving head first onto a piece of rock. The husband will shoot his wife's horse because it is maimed but also out of pure spite. She will be shocked from the very start how everyone in the family treats the white jack of all trades on the house and ranch, the one who takes care of machines, cars and other practical matters. He is young and purely trodden upon every single time they can do it. The sister in her will gives him a piece of land that is worth nothing. They try to buy him out but he refuses and keeps the piece of land. They do not shoot him on the spot because that happens with a hundred people around for the funeral. And afterwards they just look over him and do not see him at all. He becomes transparent, invisible. Only the wife keeps some distant contact with him. The husband is a bad father who has decided that his son, out of three children will have to be a rider and a cowboy of some kind. He frightens the boy out of his wits by forcing him to ride a horse at the sweet age of four or so. The wife decides to go back home for a little while with the children. There we have another image of genteel life: Thanksgiving. The three children feed Pedro, the turkey, and they are seized with unquenchable sadness when they discover the beautiful turkey that is served roasted and all for Thanksgiving dinner is Pedro. The wife's sister gets married in that period and the wife is the lady of honor or something like that when her husband arrives unannounced. That's a good moment and the two and their children can go home to Texas The last moment of social hatred comes when the jack of all trades of old who has become the owner of a piece of valueless land gets oil out of his water well and is then rich and that will devastate the old ranch life and their 40,000 or so heads of cattle. But when he comes to announce the good news to the Benedicts, all covered with oil, they don't seem to understand, at least they don't acknowledge the situation and Mr Benedict only finds the occasion amusing enough, or disturbing enough, to punch the man in the face. He gets away though before going he brings the Benedict feudal lord down with three punches. The moral is given by some member of that rich band: "You should have shot him a long time ago before he got rich." Texas the beautiful in all its splendid imbecility. Remember the Indians and their starving reservations that now are the zones where rare earths, silver, uranium and a few other natural resources are concentrated giving the Indians today the economic power that makes them great and powerful, and yet without paying one cent of federal or state taxes since Indian reservations are beyond federal and state law. That's typical of how the whites shot a bullet in their own feet when they had the power to exterminate those they did not like, and now find out that the survivors and descendants of these pariahs are able to turn the course of history around to their own benefit and profit. Never did the whites think that maybe some good equal negotiation and collaboration could have guaranteed a better future. They did not even think of the future. The word "future" was not even in their redneck-bigot dictionary. Dr Jacques COULARDEAU
