 <sinopse>
  A 1960s hipster secret agent is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his greatest enemy in the 1990s, where his social attitudes are glaringly out of place.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Austin Powers is a 60's spy who is cryonically frozen and released in the 1990's. The world is a very different place for Powers. Unfortunately for Austin, everyone is no longer sex-mad. Although he may be in a different decade, his mission is still the same. He has teamed up with Vanessa Kensington to stop the evil Dr. Evil, who was also frozen in the past. Dr. Evil stole a nuclear weapon and is demanding a payment of (when he realises its the 90's) 100 billion dollars. Can Austin Powers stop this madman? or will he caught up with Evil's henchman, with names like Alotta Fagina and Random Task? Only time will tell!

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.

He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.

    Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again. This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.

    The first of the Austin Powers movies is also the best. A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.

    The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot. Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like "The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's "Black Dynamite", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else. It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. "Powers" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied. After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man Â– the plot is essentially "Demolition Man". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies.

Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm. Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to "International Man of Mystery" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.

    An intermittently enjoyable spy spoof with Mike Myers as swinging secret agent Austin Powers, cryogenically frozen in the 1960s and thawed out decades later in order to do battle with his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers), the gag being that their methods are hopelessly outdated. It's 'Demolition Man' with jokes at the expense of the Bond films. The problem I have with this movie, and it's a big one, is that the parts that are genuinely funny and inspired are run into the ground by constant repetition and explanation. There's a scene in which one of Dr. Evil's henchmen is run over by a steamroller, after which we see his family getting the phone call to break the bad news. It's very funny at first - but it goes on and on, milking the idea to the last drop, and then it's repeated later. It's a frustrating and irritating habit and it kills much of the movie. Many of the other gags shoot fish in a barrel - Bond villains concoct overly elaborate plans to kill him, well well - but it's fun some of the time and George Clinton's score bounces around with more zip than the screenplay can provide.

    1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter. They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars..... It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well. The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic. The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases. Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet. It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected. Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most. Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.

    As summarized, I did actually laugh out loud. Mike Myers never fails to make it happen. i suppose that i went into watching it with a little bit of high expectancy, but even with that i was just genuinely amused the entire time. Also i was surprised with all of the references that people actually used today, the "danger is my middle name" business that is just classic. how i haven't seen many of Austin Powers but i really don't know why, i really wish that i could see them all in order. now what i really didn't like, was how the female main character, what ever her name is, was,SPOILER***, just another fem-bot at the beginning, what ever the story is with that, that's probably more about the spy who shagged me plot. END SPOILER**. In summation I recommend it.

    A decent comedy. Definitely some unique moments in here. Some were over the top, but some lines were definitely memorable. Acting was great for what it was intended to be. Although sometimes cheesy and just plain stupid, it is obviously meant to be that way for this movie. I feel this was a decent parody and not too much should be expected here. Lots of the events making fun of Bond clich&eacute;s are great and helped make things funnier. This was actually my least favorite Austin Powers film, though. I really don't know why I end up liking the least liked films in trilogies.

    "Groovy, Baby!" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did. Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four. We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to "today's times" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas. I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before. And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies. This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting. Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.

    Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York, Robert Wagner, Mimi Rogers, Mindy Sterling, Seth Green and Will Ferrell star in this 1997 comedy. This begins in 1967, where we meet suave, secret agent, Austin Powers (Myers) and his nemesis, Dr. Evil (Myers). After a failed attempt on Austin's life, Dr. Evil escapes and freezes himself. Austin also freezes himself in case Dr. Evil comes back. After 30 years, Dr. Evil threatens the United Nations for money and soon, Austin is thawed to capture him while adjusting to living in the 90's. Hurley plays Austin's partner, Vanessa Kensington who falls for him, Rogers plays her mother, Mrs. Kensington, York plays Austin's boss, Basil, Wagner plays Dr. Evil's henchman, Number 2, Sterling plays Dr. Evil's associate, Frau, Green plays Dr. Evil's son, Scott and Ferrell plays henchman, Mustafa who also appears in the sequel. This is a good spy spoof, Myers is great as both characters and he and Hurley have good chemistry. I recommend this.

    Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious. Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book. There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did. It's just one of those comedies you will like or you won't, and I luckily did.
