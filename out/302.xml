 <sinopse>
  As corruption grows in 1950s LA, three policemen - the straight-laced, the brutal, and the sleazy - investigate a series of murders with their own brand of justice.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  1950's Los Angeles is the seedy backdrop for this intricate noir-ish tale of police corruption and Hollywood sleaze. Three very different cops are all after the truth, each in their own style: Ed Exley, the golden boy of the police force, willing to do almost anything to get ahead, except sell out; Bud White, ready to break the rules to seek justice, but barely able to keep his raging violence under control; and Jack Vincennes, always looking for celebrity and a quick buck until his conscience drives him to join Exley and White down the one-way path to find the truth behind the dark world of L.A. crime.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    "Rollo Tamasi is the reason I became a cop. I wanted to catch the guys who thought they could get away with it. It's supposed to be about justice." L.A. Confidential was a very pleasant surprise. I had been waiting a long time for a crime drama like this one and somehow I had never been able to see this classic film from 1997. They don't make crime dramas like they used to in the 90's anymore. L.A. Confidential belongs in the same rank as Se7en, The Usual Suspects, and Heat in my opinion. Unfortunately, in the last decade this genre has faded away. This is director Curtis Hanson's best film and despite directing many more movies in the last decade they have been decent or misses. None of his films compare to the set and mood he's established here with LA Confidential. The film is full of suspense, thrills, and has several twists along the way. This is just the kind of film I love to see. The performances were also all really strong thanks to a spectacular cast and a fabulous adapted screenplay written by Hanson and Brian Helgeland (42, Man on Fire, Mystic River). The script was adapted from James Ellroy's crime novel and it incorporates several true events from the 1950's crime world in L.A. Fans of film noir and crime thrillers will be in for a treat here because this is a really special movie and it deserves all the awards it has received because this is a very satisfying film. The last hour of this thriller is really intense and will leave you at the edge of your seat. The build up is also very satisfying because the characters and events are all well developed. The film takes place in LA during the early 50's right after the arrest of the well known gangster, Mickey Cohen. The LA police department is as popular as ever thanks to this arrest and a TV drama glorifying them. They are prepared now to face the war over the control of the drug trade that Cohen's arrest has provoked. Among the best men in the department we have the hot headed cop, Bud White (Russell Crowe) who is willing to do what it takes as long as the guilty pay for their crimes. He's extremely sensitive towards abused females and is ready to punish the criminals. Jack Vincennes (Kevin Spacey) on the other hand is always looking for fame considering he's a consultant for the cop TV show. Jack has close ties with Sid Hudgens (Danny DeVito) a magazine editor who makes deals with him to cover some high profile arrests after setting up their victims. Then there is the promising young officer Edmund Exley (Guy Pearce) who does things by the books and has impressed the DA and high officials for his smarts. Exley is ambitious and is looking for a big arrest in order to climb the ranks. These three men despite being very different from each other will have to join forces if they want to solve the brutal crime that has just taken place near a local cafe. Their main suspect is the millionaire, Pierce Patchett (David Strathairn), who runs a sort of high profile prostitution net involving Hollywood star look a like hookers. One of these hookers, Lynn Bracken, is played by Kim Bassinger and begins to be romantically involved with Bud. James Cromwell plays a supporting role as one of the Sergeant's in the police department. This film received 9 Academy Award nominations including best picture and director, but only won two (Kim Bassinger for best supporting actress and Hanson for best adapted screenplay). There is something unique about this film despite the fact that the subject matter has been dealt with before a million times (corrupt cops and gangsters) and I think it has to do with the fact that there is no main character here. All three officers have the same amount of screen time and they all kind of play out like anti heroes. They are not your usual heroic cops, instead they are all flawed but easy for the viewer to identify with and root for. I was interested in what was going to happen to each one of the characters in this film. There are good enough twists for the audience to enjoy this film based on the action alone, but the performances from Spacey, Pierce, and Crowe are all so good that they just elevate this film and take it to an entire other level. Basinger is really good here as well, but I don't think she was better than the male actors in this film. L.A. Confidential is one of the best crime dramas I've seen thanks to a great script, some incredible performances, memorable characters, and a lot of thrills. This film is a must see.

    L.A. Confidential is a neo-noir film from the mid 90's that should have won the all the Academy Awards instead of Titanic. It's as brilliant as Chinatown and ranks up with the best noir films like Touch of Evil. It creates an interesting world with complex characters, grey morality and enough mystery and intrigue that would make your head spin. The acting is very strong, the highlights being Kevin Spacey and Kim Basinger. The script is absolute dynamite, giving us great lines of dialog, interesting mystery and very strong characters. The direction and visuals perfectly compliment the story and time period the film was set. L.A. Confidential showcases what can be done with good source material put on screen by people who really know what they are doing. L.A. Confidential did everything right that all films that followed couldn't capture not a single drop of that brilliance. A key to good noir film is great story with interesting characters, not violent bloodbaths, slick suits and flashy direction. Go watch L.A. Confidential if you haven't seen it. If you like films like Chinatown, Touch of Evil, Maltese Falcon or really enjoyed L.A. Noir video game this is a must see. Unless you have attention deficit and need explosions, gore, boobs and unfunny Adam Sandler to keep you entertained.

    L.A. Confidential is an excellent film that immerses the viewer with an excellent grasp on atmosphere, music, and characters, which helps fill the movie with very satisfying feel. While the movie's pace may come in to question for some, I felt that the exponential growth in pacing was more than appropriate for this kind of film, few films in the modern era are able to capture the magic of the genre that is Noir, and even fewer seem to do it while still remaining in it's investigator story style roots, The actors are apparently well aware of the role the are seeking to fill and that knowledge is another amazing aspect of L.A. Confidential because the acting is attuned for the genre, The mixture of all these well adjusted aspects makes it a classic and enjoyable film.

    while i was watching this movie,a retro cop persona was taking over my mind,while i was admiring the it's screenplay and the actors.especially Guy Pearce,Russel Crowe and Kim Basinger giving crisp performances. i was quite sure about this coming out as the best cop movie i have ever seen.BUT as soon as the suspense of 'who's organizing the crime in Los Angie' is revealed...the movie starts to show glimpses of being half baked from there. another thing that bothered me was,why the hell should Kim basinger's character be shown having some intimate feelings about Edmund J Exeley during his award ceremony.they never had an affair..just an one night stand,and that too because Lynn was paid to do it.for me that was very lame..a great script otherwise. for me la confidential still stands out as one of the most authentic cop movies of all times.

    LA Confidential is a great film, based on a great book of the same name by James Ellroy. It is filled with fabulous characters from the 1950's LA police department each with their own subplots. The three main characters will have to work together to bring down corruption in the LA police department. All the actors in LA Confidential are excellent and the three leading men all went on to star in their own great films after this. Kevin Spacey, Russell Crowe, and Guy Pearce. LA confidential on paper sounds boring, but give it a chance and you will be caught up in its deep and intriguing plot as it unfolds. Special mention to Kin Basinger who puts in a Oscar winning performance as Lyn Brackett. Supporting roles for the always great Danny Devito, and James Cromwell. I highly recommend LA Confidential as one of the best films of the 90s, it was unlucky to come out the same year as Titanic as it would of certainly won more Oscars then it did.

    After watching Hollywood virtually incapable of producing a convincing period piece during the stultifyingly self-conscious '80s, what a relief to see that the 1990s didn't have the same problem. LA CONFIDENTIAL is a splashy, game cinematic display of slime, corruption and intrigue set to the backdrop of 1950s showbiz-obsessed Los Angeles and its infamously dirty police department. With Jerry Goldsmith's CHINATOWNesque score adding immeasurably to the thing. Oh, I suppose it's not perfect. But darn near close to it. Don't be turned off by (as a result of expecting too much from) Kim Basinger's Oscar'd performance: she's okay and certainly acceptable given the role, but her award-winning stature was largely over-hyped because, as 1997 was the year of horrid TITANIC (which was guaranteed an Oscar sweep due to block voting from two studios) the much-superior LA CONFIDENTIAL was thrown a conciliatory bone which landed in Kim's lap... Again, she's just fine, but don't sit down to watch this thinking she's going to be the main attraction; she's really a lesser light in the picture. Anyway, it's interesting how rarely Tinseltown has ever managed to do a really captivatingly gossipy, warts-and-all (if fictionalized) expose on itself. But LA CONFIDENTIAL has succeeded in doing exactly that. I have essentially no complaints. Except, perhaps, for the Lana Turner scene: Turner was far too famous not to hire a model who more closely resembled her; as a result of not doing so, the moment is nowhere near as funny as it could've been.

    A movie that pretty much launched Russel Crowe and Guy Pearce, L.A. Confidential provides some of the best in character development in films post 1990. A group of Los Angeles police officers in the late 1940s find themselves unraveling and involved with a brutal mass murder. Is it the mob, led by famous LA gangster Mickey Cohen? African American hoodlums, who the police initially target? Or the cops themselves. Every cop character in this movie has a different personality, and a different motive for why he is good, bad, or both. Crowe's performance was nothing short of outstanding, as was Pearce. These were two guys who hated each other and couldn't be more opposite, but both out for doing right. Pearce's character often annoying and nerdish. Crowe, a very likable tough guy. James Cromwell, the smart, straight, but really shady captain, outstanding. Grahem Beckel as Crowe's dirty cop partner, outstanding. Kevin Spacey, a cop torn between his love for being the consultant for a Hollywood TV cop show and making a buck selling stories and following the law in important cases, outstanding. David Stratherin and Danny DeVito, outstanding. The only question. Why did Kim Bassinger win an Academy Award for this movie? There was nothing really outstanding in her performance, and the role wasn't all that important to the film. The writing, outstanding, better than outstanding, as was the direction. There were so many better performances in this film that warranted the award.

    L.A Confidential is an excellent neo-noir detective film. Set in the 50's heyday of the original noirs, it is able to recall the past while updating it for the 90's. The fantastic production design oozes period detail perfectly and captures both the Hollywood glamour but also the dark underbelly of L.A. The look and feel is one of its chief pleasures, creating an atmosphere and mood all of its own. The story is a typically convoluted murder mystery with the influence of the hard-boiled detective novels that inspired the original film-noirs. It's a very well controlled narrative which keeps the mystery enticing while introducing the characters brilliantly. They are a typical array of types you would expect to see in such films, such as the femme fatale and the cynical cop. But the beauty of the film is that it gives us the ingredients we are used to and want but fleshes them out in ways that makes it all feel very fresh. The performances by the key players are hugely instrumental here. Russell Crowe, Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey are the three very different policemen involved in the case and all give exemplary work. While Kim Basinger and James Cromwell impress in important support roles. It's a real ensemble film. And with a very written script you have the final piece in the jigsaw, making this a film that works as a mystery and dramatically; a film that mixes the glamour with the darkness. In this sense it resembles a 90's Chinatown and you don't get much better than that.

    People seem to feel the need to compare this remarkable film with the film noir genre as well as with the time honored classic Chinatown. Although they are not wrong in their comparisons, LA Confidential should be taken as a great film in its own right. A movie like this has a plot so well woven, with acting to support, and a cast that will blow you away, that it can't help but stand out. Everything from the great acting to the fantastic direction to the remarkable screenplay (which contains some truly great lines... "Go back to Jersey..."), is so perfectly executed that I find it amazing how studios consistently release such mediocre junk these days when they could elect to finance films like this. Gritty homage to film noir about three detectives, Spacey, a big hotshot T.V. police adviser, Crowe, a defender of women against abusers and Pearce, an ambitious yet naive detective are involved in a complex case of sex, scandal, and murder. Strange, fascinating mystery in the best Hammett/Chandler tradition is vivid and atmospheric, all thanks to the superb cast including Bassinger, who richly won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar as the Veronica Lake-ish fem me fatale who's surrounded by her Oscar-worthy costars including Cromwell as the police captain who's more important than you think. Directed by Hanson, who with Brian Helgeland won a well deserving Best Adapted Screeplay Oscar. A modern masterpiece of film-making based on James Ellroy's novel. The movie plays out like a series of events that seem to be separate but is eerily connected, and a plot like that holds the most commendment I can award a film with. This movie totally kicks Titanic's butt! This should have won best picture (just my personal view). It had an excellent story, acting, and set design. All in all it has something for everybody, action, romance, comedy, suspense, mystery, crime, drama and anything you name it. My Rating 9/10

    "L.A. Confidential" is so glossy it gleams. Director Curtis Hanson knows how to shoot the stuff that great crime movies are made of, and with style: bloodstained diners, ritzy villas, grody slumhouses, paper- strewn police departments--this movie makes them all look good. The soul of noir is in these places, but they are flooded with brightness instead of cloaked in shadows, and there always seems to be a magic hour glow around the actors. The casting is almost absurdly spot-on: Kevin Spacey as a smarmy egoist, Danny DeVito as a fast-talking sleaze merchant, Russell Crowe as a brooding bruiser. These are big stars of the best sort, ones who make their names and their money on serious projects that please both crowds and critics. Everything about "L.A. Confidential" fits that bill, and it all works just as well here as it does in the best action thrillers, from the corrupt cops and the green rookies to the gangland executions and the epic shootouts. It's a genre piece, but an impeccable one. In a different year, one when "Titanic" wasn't sweeping up practically every award in sight, it could have netted half a dozen Oscars instead of just two from nine nominations.
