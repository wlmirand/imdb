 <sinopse>
  A mild-mannered chemist and an ex-con must lead the counterstrike when a rogue group of military men, led by a renegade general, threaten a nerve gas attack from Alcatraz against San Francisco.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Stanley Goodspeed, who lives in Washington D.C., is a biochemist who works for the FBI. Soon after his fianc&eacute;e Carla Pestalozzi announces that she is pregnant, Stanley gets a call from FBI director James Womack. Womack tells Stanley that San Francisco's Alcatraz Island has been taken hostage, along with 81 tourists, by marine General Francis Xavier Hummel who, for years, has been protesting the government's refusal to pay benefits to families of war veterans who died during covert military operations. The death of his wife Barbara Hummel on March 9, 1995 drove General Hummel over the edge, and now he's holding hostages in order to get his point across. Stanley is needed because General Hummel has stolen some VX gas warheads and has announced that he will launch them onto San Francisco unless his demands are met. Stanley knows how to disarm the bombs, but Stanley needs someone who knows Alcatraz well enough to get him inside. That man is former British intelligence agent John Patrick ...

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes. When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

    The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

    The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes. When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

    The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes. When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe

    The Rock is a action fans dream. It has action from basically beginning to end, a never ending supply of big guns, corny Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery lines that really only they can get away with. Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

Add in Ed Harris and all the other amazing actors that were chosen to play in this movie and it really is the total package! What I believe makes this movie better than other movies similar to it is the depth that each character brings to the table. It's unclear at times who is truly the "bad guys!" That makes this movie so much more interesting. The movie came out in 1996 which I believe is around the real turning point in graphics and such. The blood looks like real blood and the explosions look realistic not exaggerated. All in all, I very much enjoyed this movie and it is definitely one that belongs in any action lovers collection!

    Story/Plot - Alcatraz Island has been taken over by a group of marines led by General Francis Xavier Hummel. They also have taken 81 tourists who were on the island as hostages. He is using these hostages as his leverage in his bid to make the government pay benefits to those who have lost loved ones in secret military operations. His wife died recently and this pushed him far over the edge, hence the hostage taking. An FBI biochemist whose partner has just announced that she is pregnant gets the call that Alcatraz is now under terrorist control. His name is Stanley Goodspeed. Stanley discovers that the general has a selection of deadly warheads containing a gas called VX. The general has threatened to use these nukes on American soil unless his demands are met. Luckily Stanley nows how to disarm these nukes. The only down side is that he doesn't know his way around Alcatraz island. This is where John Patrick Mason comes in handy. An ex MI5 or 6 operative, John is the only person to have ever escaped from Alcatraz so is the best suited man for the job. Although John is currently in prison for supposedly stealing the personal files of ex president Hoover. However John even though he would love to see the FBI fail he joins forces with Stanley to put an end to the generals terrorism. Together John and Stanley enter Alcatraz island with a team of highly trained US Navy Seals. As the move through the prison facility the seal team are killed, leaving John and Stanley to finish this themselves. Will they reach the hostages and free them, will they neutralize the bombs and take down the general and his men?? The answer is .........................watch the film to find out. My verdict - Nicholas Cage as Stanley and Sean Connery as John make a perfect pair. The explosive match they have is perfect to this film. This is such a great film and is one I personally could watch over and over again.

    I don't understand how so many people can say this movie is great. I thought it was terrible. This is the kind of movie where cars blow up for no reason and create unrealistically huge fireballs. Not only that, but the dialogue is cheesy, with typical one liners like "I'm too old for this." The plot is reminiscent of one of the not as good seasons of 24, but not as developed. As stated by other users, the villain was the best part of the movie. Perhaps I'm biased because this movie had been hyped up to me for so many years, and when I finally watched it I was extremely disappointed. But regardless, the movie was bad (although there are plenty worse out there). I probably would have rated the movie lower, but it was entertaining enough that I was able to get through it, despite being tempted to turn it off several times.

    The Rock is an absolutely brilliant film which is jam packed with excitement, humour, tension and it also contains characters with plenty of depth. The film begins with General Francis X Hummel (Ed Harris) at his wife's grave apologising to her saying that he 'is sorry and that he has to do this'. Hummel is the leader of the US Marines and we see in the beginning that he gains access to Alcatraz to steal biological weapons under the pretence that they are carrying out a security check. Once they have the weapons, this then sets up the second act where Hummel and his men seize control of Alcatraz by appearing to be on a tour of Alcatraz with a group of civilians. Once inside the prison, Hummel and his men take their opportunity and hold the civilians and the tour guide hostage. Hummel makes his demands to the FBI and the government and demands a substantial amount of money within 40 hours otherwise he will unleash the biological weapons onto San Francisco Bay. What makes the Rock stand out as a good thriller is that this isn't just a case of a lunatic just holding people hostage for no apparent reason? We get to learn that Hummel and his men all feel cheated by the government - members of their platoon lost their lives with seemingly no acknowledgement from the government. They are also angry as there was no compensation from the government for the victims of those men who lost their lives. This sets Hummel and his men up sort of as 'vigilantes'. So whilst what they are doing is wrong, in a way they feel that they are on a 'moral crusade' - they don't see why they should value other people's lives when the government clearly didn't care about the lives of any of their men that were killed. This not only gives the story depth, but it also gives the characters depth too. Due to the intelligence that the Marines have, the government and the FBI know that they need to send the 'best' that they have in order to infiltrate the Marines and free the hostages. They feel they need a chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Cage) in order to disarm the bombs, but in order for the weapons expert to be able to disarm the bombs they'll need someone who knows the prison inside and out and thus they also send in the only man to ever escape Alcatraz John Mason (Connery) who has been incarcerated for over 30 years. Mason is reluctant to help at first and only agrees to help in order to get a pardon - a lot of fun in the Rock comes from Mason's numerous escape attempts (which are usually quite creative). It is also amusing to see the 2 men constantly trying to 'out do' each other. Another thing that I enjoyed was the 'tongue in cheek' approach that Michael Bay has taken when making this film. Not only have we got a film with a strong plot and good character development, but it is clear that both Bay and the cast had fun when making this film. There were so many funny moments and great one liners that I just can't remember all of them. Then we come to the acting. Sean Connery is one of my favourite actors and he always seems to bring that little something extra in any film he appears in. I predicted before I started watching the film that he would have some of the funniest lines and I was right. Nicolas Cage is a bit of a hit and miss actor in my book, but I thought he was great in this as well. I felt that him and Connery played off each other really well. This is an outstanding film with lots of tension, plenty of funny scenes, good plot and is packed full of great characters and is definitely not to be missed!

    The Rock opens with a military funeral, intercut with explosions, and with Hans Zimmer's dramatic score in the background. Yep, it's pure Michael Bay: just about all of the man's films feature huge, overblown action scenes, big fiery explosions, energetic car chases, silly humor, and a hyperactive style. It's made for a rather shallow experience for some of his films, but in his second full-length feature film, all the excesses align perfectly, crafting one of the purest and most thrilling action movies of all time. You can certainly expect lots of action: the shootouts are loud and intense, there is one awesome car chase, and there are quite a few major explosions. Characters often exchange witty lines throughout. And when the bullets aren't flying, the film still maintains furious momentum with its suspense and political intrigue. It's a perfectly loud and explosive picture, but without being too overblown (especially not as much as Bay's Transformers trilogy). Thankfully, The Rock is not all about endless gunfire and pyrotechnics. The film utilizes pretty common elements of action movies: terrorists take some hostages, good guys have to rescue them and stop the chemical missiles from causing widespread death. The Rock offers some clever variations though, especially by having the terrorists take over Alcatraz, turning the titular prison (and in some parts, San Francisco) into a massive action setpiece. Above all, the characters propel the film into above-average fare: the protagonists are an unlikely pair, sharing entertaining chemistry, and each one has likable traits and personal stakes attached to them. The villains are especially noteworthy, because they're not just mindless nameless bad guys: they have a patriotic motivation, and they show surprising humanity at times. The plot overall is pretty well-built and evenly-paced. This film has solid photography, which includes a lot of cool-looking camera angles and movements. It gets really shaky during the big car chase, but it's far from unbearable. Editing can be fast at times, but once again, it's not too unbearable. Acting is solid: Nicholas Cage dishes out a lot of humor, but he's appropriately serious when he needs to be; Sean Connery is at his most badass here, and Ed Harris really nails his role. Writing is pretty good. This production uses some very cool and real-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Hans Zimmer's music score is the essence of action-movie music. In fact, the movie overall embodies the essence of an action movie. Recommended! 4.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Good | Film: Very Good)

    Honestly, there is no surprise, no suspense, no heartbeat moment for me at all. Just like the other million of gun movies showing on every year, two agents here become our heroes. When I saw Sean Connely, there were some feeling that am I seeing 007 series. After knowing that he plays a British agent in the movie, I am definitely sure that the director shows us the prisoned James Bond. However, if you want to see the acute fight scene of him in this pic, it will be a little disappointed, after all he is an old man, how can we expect him to do well in the things belonging to youngsters. I think he has already done his best in this performance, gets to the level where an old actor should be. Here I do not want to talk about the plot, as it is a stereotype, gets nothing to tell. There are some words for our main male actor Nicol, his performance is not as good as our old man. Sometimes you can see the scary he expressed in this film seems like not real enough. Of course, some deficiency of the film can not be his responsibility, such as a professional biological chemistry expert can unexpectedly put the most toxic weapon in the sewer. Maybe I can understand if I were in his situation, but I am still feel bad about some details. To my surprise, a platoon of marine can be easily killed by an old man spending half of life in prison and just coming out. Anyway, if I get time and want to see some movies without brainstorms, this one would on my list.

    The Rock is a "today they don't make movies like this anymore" movie. It is a 90's movie. The Rock is also Michael Bay's best film by far to date. Bad Boys was a good action film, but just good. It was a pretty stylish, but average film. Armageddon was almost a disaster for me personally. It had its moments, the cast was strong, the visual effects, some of those were jaw dropping at that time, but in the end, that movie seriously disappointed me. I liked Pearl Harbor, but in comparison with Tora Tora Tora, it was just another good but not great Michael Bay film. It was epic, it was grand, but that's all. Bad Boys 2 was much better than the first one as expected, because the first one wasn't that great, I enjoyed it, but again I can't say that it was a great or a remarkable action film. The Island, it was Michael Bay's second best film, after The Rock. It has a solid story, an amazing Bay style chase sequence, good action, a solid cast... As for Transformers trilogy, I enjoyed it, especially the first installment, but the sequels were uneven, too big, too noisy, too exaggerating, an empty and overdone fun ride let's say! However, The Rock is very different than all of those! The Rock is a great, subtle action film. It is almost an epic action movie from the first minute till the last. The action is very well done here. The direction is subtle, controlled and stylish. It has an original, solid story, may be the best film about Alcatraz (for example much better than Escape from Alcatraz if you ask me) The Rock also has one of the best soundtracks ever! I just have no comment on that. Sean Connery is great as always, but Nicolas Cage is very good too. In those years, Nicolas Cage wasn't an action star, as I know, his first debut as an action star was Snake Eyes, then The Rock. However, despite he was an amateur in those years, at the same time despite he wasn't an experienced action star, he is much better than in this movie than all of his recent movies. He is more subtle in The Rock. Ed Harris, what an I say? may be he is as great as Connery. And the man of those kind of roles, David Morse who fits his role perfectly again is your bonus! Also we see "Candyman" there as one of the henchmen of Ed Harris's character! The car chase sequence is one of the best ones ever I believe. Honestly, I prefer this one than the ones in Transformers movies. There is not too much militarism in this movie in comparison with the other Michael Bay movies which is good! Also the film never tries to be politically correct which is great! In addition, this isn't a propaganda movie like some Peter Berg movies. The jet scene makes you get goose bumps and it was an iconic moment in Michael Bay cinema that was later used a few times by the director himself. And I will never forget those green balls!

    Michael Bay is well-known for making bad movies like Pearl Habor or Armageddon or the Transformers movies but I have to say this is one of his rare action movies that are actually good and worth-watching. One of the main reasons is because it has two of my favourite actors, Nicolas Cage and Sean Connery team up together as Stanley Goodspeed and John Mason. Sean Connery (who was 66-years-old when he did this movie), really showed that despite his age, he's really great and badass in The Rock. Nicolas Cage was kind of corny at times but I still think he did well and he and Connery were a very good duo. In fact, it was probably Sean Connery's best duo since he teamed up with Harrison Ford in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. The story is good, but nothing special though and the acting is generally done well as well and the dialogue is entertaining. And the action sequences tremendous and have you at the edge of your seat and it's not too overdone or over-the-top. Ed Harris did great as well but I think he was more of an anti-hero than a villain. Also I wish we could've seen more of Michael Biehn because his character was killed off too soon. But I'd say any fan of Sean Connery or Nicolas Cage or action movies in general will love this movie.

    As far as I am concerned this is a great action/thriller movie. The fact that one of my all-time favorite actors, Sean Connery, plays in it is of course a good start. Despite Nicholas Cage having done quite a few crappy movies I still like him as well. At least when he plays in decent movies. I first watched this movie sometime around when it came out. I did not watch it in a theater though so it must have been on VHS or TV. I thought it was a great movie already then. When I re-watched it yesterday onW9 HD I did not find any reason to change my opinion. I was surprised at how much action, especially the blowing-up-cars kind of action, there are in this movie though. I did not remember those parts but more of the stealth and breaking into Alcatraz parts. But then, considering that it had Michael Bay as director I guess this one have to be considered quite moderate in the blowing-things-up department after all. The story is actually not too unbelievable and the bad guys are not so ridiculously freaked out as they are in many movies of this type. Sean Connery is great as always but the acting in general is of high standard throughout the movie. The dialogue between him and Nicholas Cage as well as other people in the movie is definitely entertaining. The action, as I have already partly mentioned, is great and not too overdone either. It is an action/thriller movie though (maybe with some more emphasis on action than thriller) so do not expect to be intellectually stimulated. The movie is meant to entertain and that it does with flying colors. Despite it being 136 minutes long it certainly did not feel too long. Actually I do not know why this movie is not in my DVD/BD collection. I think I will get it even though I have just seen it on TV.

    Some time after the untimely death of his wife, vengeful Vietnam veteran Ed Harris (as Francis X. Hummel) and his gang of disgruntled Marines bust unto the legendary prison Alcatraz. They want reparations for unrecognized service. "The Rock" (also known as Alcatraz) has been closed since 1963 and is presently a tourist attraction. Taking 81 visitors hostage, Mr. Harris plans to hit San Francisco with weapons of mass destruction unless his demands are met. The US government doesn't want to pay Harris and the Marines. Instead, they assign two men to break in to Alcatraz and disarm Harris. Yes, it's a daunting task... First called is Beatlemaniac and chemical weapons expert Nicholas Cage (as Stanley "Stan" Goodspeed), notified while simulating intercourse with top girl Vanessa Marcil (as Carla Pestalozzi). Second called is thick scraggly-haired Sean Connery (as John Patrick Mason), the only man to have escaped from Alcatraz. Released after 30 years in prison, Mr. Connery cleans up well. Producers are careful to show many of Connery's innocent victims survive otherwise certain death. Connery knows details about Roswell aliens and the JFK assassination. Michael Bay's direction is action-packed. It all ends in an orgy of violence... Of the sprightly supporting cast, William Forsythe (as Ernest Paxton) deserves special mention; he is credited twice during the opening credits. This error (or, perhaps not because Mr. Forsythe is very good in his role) can be seen in the print being shown to "Charter" customers in the Los Angeles area. The first credit seems to be on screen more briefly. After a relative long pause, William Forsythe is credited again. Maybe he'll receive a double residual check during this showing... ****** The Rock (6/7/96) Michael Bay ~ Nicholas Cage, Sean Connery, Ed Harris, William Forsythe
