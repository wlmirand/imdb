 <sinopse>
  Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude at a funeral.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Self-destructive and needy but wealthy teenager Harold is obsessed with death and spends his leisure time attending funerals, watching the demolition of buildings, visiting junkyards, simulating suicides trying to get the attention of his indifferent, snobbish and egocentric mother, and having sessions with his psychologist. When Harold meets the anarchic seventy-nine-year-old Maude at a funeral, they become friends and the old lady discloses other perspectives of the cycle of life for him. Meanwhile, his mother enlists him in a dating service and tries to force him to join the army. On the day of Maude's eightieth birthday, Harold proposes to her but he finds the truth about life at the end of hers.

    This film is about a young man with a morbid fascination with death. He meets an 79 years old woman and connects with her in many ways. "Harold and Maude" begins with a suicide scene which is powerful and haunting. The shock of the suicide, and the even more shocking response of the mother makes "Harold and Maude" captivating right from the start. Harold's innovative ways to die continue to shock me, and I find myself screaming at the visually disturbing acts. The unlikely friendship with Maude is quite amazing, as they break social norms and bond because they really get along with each other. The ending is rather open, but I take it as Harold being transformed by Maude. "Harold and Maude" is not the usual comedy, it is very dark and yet engaging and captivating.

    This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of "the greatest generation" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from "Let It All Hang Out" to "Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes. The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons. This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film "IQ". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.

    Everything about this show was great- the writing, the casting, the story, and, of course, Cat Stevens! This is one of the most uplifting stories ever. This is a story about life, love, and learning to love life, yourself, and others. It is about learning to grab life with both hands and experiencing as much as you can. The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a "must see". If your spirit is in need of being lightened, then this is your movie. It delivers its message without being sappy, trite or overly sentimental.

    When I first heard about 'Harold and Maude', I thought it seem like it would be an awfully strange and disgusting movie that I was easily going to hate, but I sat down with an open mind and found it to be (like I said) pretty fascinating. The weirdness of 'Harold and Maude' surrounds a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), who is royally and oddly obsessed with death. Some of his favorite hobbies are attending funerals of people who Harold doesn't even know and staging these fake suicide acts; like hanging himself on a noose, shooting himself, setting himself on fire, and so forth. He does those acts just to get a reaction from his mother (Vivian Pickles). What makes the movie even weirder is when Harold is attending a funeral and meets an 80-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who is obsessed with life. So, they start having this relationship with each other, and Harold starts to get a sense from her, which starts to change his own life forever. The main focus of this movie is the two main actors: Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both do a brilliant job interpreting the meaning of life and death. They both had great chemistry and they are both interesting characters. This movie has a dark sense of humor. There are scenes that make you laugh-out-loud just how odd they truly are. For instance, Harold's suicide acts, Maude stealing other people's vehicle, and what not. I know people are probably going to be quite offended by its humor, but maybe the others will be oddly amused by the humor, like I was. I loved the cinematography; it's some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring songs by Cat Stevens . . . what more do you need from a movie that has to do with life? The songs are just very meaningful and fit the themes perfectly. 10/10

    Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold (Bud Cort) finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral. My biggest problem with this film was the abuse of Cat Stevens. Did we need an entire soundtrack from him? No. Did we need to hear the same song three (or more) times? No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought. It gets more complicated when you make the friendship into a romantic bond -- was this a bad idea, a good idea, pushing the envelope or what?

    Twenty-year-old man finds his soul mate in 80-year-old woman. This is a movie of its time. The main point of the film is that eccentricity is good; authority is bad. As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

    I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.

    This film is about a young man with a morbid fascination with death. He meets an 79 years old woman and connects with her in many ways. "Harold and Maude" begins with a suicide scene which is powerful and haunting. The shock of the suicide, and the even more shocking response of the mother makes "Harold and Maude" captivating right from the start. Harold's innovative ways to die continue to shock me, and I find myself screaming at the visually disturbing acts. The unlikely friendship with Maude is quite amazing, as they break social norms and bond because they really get along with each other. The ending is rather open, but I take it as Harold being transformed by Maude. "Harold and Maude" is not the usual comedy, it is very dark and yet engaging and captivating.

    This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of "the greatest generation" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from "Let It All Hang Out" to "Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes. The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons. This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film "IQ". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.

    Everything about this show was great- the writing, the casting, the story, and, of course, Cat Stevens! This is one of the most uplifting stories ever. This is a story about life, love, and learning to love life, yourself, and others. It is about learning to grab life with both hands and experiencing as much as you can. The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a "must see". If your spirit is in need of being lightened, then this is your movie. It delivers its message without being sappy, trite or overly sentimental.

    When I first heard about 'Harold and Maude', I thought it seem like it would be an awfully strange and disgusting movie that I was easily going to hate, but I sat down with an open mind and found it to be (like I said) pretty fascinating. The weirdness of 'Harold and Maude' surrounds a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), who is royally and oddly obsessed with death. Some of his favorite hobbies are attending funerals of people who Harold doesn't even know and staging these fake suicide acts; like hanging himself on a noose, shooting himself, setting himself on fire, and so forth. He does those acts just to get a reaction from his mother (Vivian Pickles). What makes the movie even weirder is when Harold is attending a funeral and meets an 80-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who is obsessed with life. So, they start having this relationship with each other, and Harold starts to get a sense from her, which starts to change his own life forever. The main focus of this movie is the two main actors: Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both do a brilliant job interpreting the meaning of life and death. They both had great chemistry and they are both interesting characters. This movie has a dark sense of humor. There are scenes that make you laugh-out-loud just how odd they truly are. For instance, Harold's suicide acts, Maude stealing other people's vehicle, and what not. I know people are probably going to be quite offended by its humor, but maybe the others will be oddly amused by the humor, like I was. I loved the cinematography; it's some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring songs by Cat Stevens . . . what more do you need from a movie that has to do with life? The songs are just very meaningful and fit the themes perfectly. 10/10

    Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold (Bud Cort) finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral. My biggest problem with this film was the abuse of Cat Stevens. Did we need an entire soundtrack from him? No. Did we need to hear the same song three (or more) times? No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought. It gets more complicated when you make the friendship into a romantic bond -- was this a bad idea, a good idea, pushing the envelope or what?

    Twenty-year-old man finds his soul mate in 80-year-old woman. This is a movie of its time. The main point of the film is that eccentricity is good; authority is bad. As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

    I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.

    This film is about a young man with a morbid fascination with death. He meets an 79 years old woman and connects with her in many ways. "Harold and Maude" begins with a suicide scene which is powerful and haunting. The shock of the suicide, and the even more shocking response of the mother makes "Harold and Maude" captivating right from the start. Harold's innovative ways to die continue to shock me, and I find myself screaming at the visually disturbing acts. The unlikely friendship with Maude is quite amazing, as they break social norms and bond because they really get along with each other. The ending is rather open, but I take it as Harold being transformed by Maude. "Harold and Maude" is not the usual comedy, it is very dark and yet engaging and captivating.

    This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of "the greatest generation" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from "Let It All Hang Out" to "Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes. The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons. This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film "IQ". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.

    Everything about this show was great- the writing, the casting, the story, and, of course, Cat Stevens! This is one of the most uplifting stories ever. This is a story about life, love, and learning to love life, yourself, and others. It is about learning to grab life with both hands and experiencing as much as you can. The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a "must see". If your spirit is in need of being lightened, then this is your movie. It delivers its message without being sappy, trite or overly sentimental.

    When I first heard about 'Harold and Maude', I thought it seem like it would be an awfully strange and disgusting movie that I was easily going to hate, but I sat down with an open mind and found it to be (like I said) pretty fascinating. The weirdness of 'Harold and Maude' surrounds a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), who is royally and oddly obsessed with death. Some of his favorite hobbies are attending funerals of people who Harold doesn't even know and staging these fake suicide acts; like hanging himself on a noose, shooting himself, setting himself on fire, and so forth. He does those acts just to get a reaction from his mother (Vivian Pickles). What makes the movie even weirder is when Harold is attending a funeral and meets an 80-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who is obsessed with life. So, they start having this relationship with each other, and Harold starts to get a sense from her, which starts to change his own life forever. The main focus of this movie is the two main actors: Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both do a brilliant job interpreting the meaning of life and death. They both had great chemistry and they are both interesting characters. This movie has a dark sense of humor. There are scenes that make you laugh-out-loud just how odd they truly are. For instance, Harold's suicide acts, Maude stealing other people's vehicle, and what not. I know people are probably going to be quite offended by its humor, but maybe the others will be oddly amused by the humor, like I was. I loved the cinematography; it's some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring songs by Cat Stevens . . . what more do you need from a movie that has to do with life? The songs are just very meaningful and fit the themes perfectly. 10/10

    Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold (Bud Cort) finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral. My biggest problem with this film was the abuse of Cat Stevens. Did we need an entire soundtrack from him? No. Did we need to hear the same song three (or more) times? No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought. It gets more complicated when you make the friendship into a romantic bond -- was this a bad idea, a good idea, pushing the envelope or what?

    Twenty-year-old man finds his soul mate in 80-year-old woman. This is a movie of its time. The main point of the film is that eccentricity is good; authority is bad. As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

    I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.

    This film is about a young man with a morbid fascination with death. He meets an 79 years old woman and connects with her in many ways. "Harold and Maude" begins with a suicide scene which is powerful and haunting. The shock of the suicide, and the even more shocking response of the mother makes "Harold and Maude" captivating right from the start. Harold's innovative ways to die continue to shock me, and I find myself screaming at the visually disturbing acts. The unlikely friendship with Maude is quite amazing, as they break social norms and bond because they really get along with each other. The ending is rather open, but I take it as Harold being transformed by Maude. "Harold and Maude" is not the usual comedy, it is very dark and yet engaging and captivating.

    This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of "the greatest generation" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from "Let It All Hang Out" to "Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes. The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons. This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film "IQ". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.

    Everything about this show was great- the writing, the casting, the story, and, of course, Cat Stevens! This is one of the most uplifting stories ever. This is a story about life, love, and learning to love life, yourself, and others. It is about learning to grab life with both hands and experiencing as much as you can. The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a "must see". If your spirit is in need of being lightened, then this is your movie. It delivers its message without being sappy, trite or overly sentimental.

    When I first heard about 'Harold and Maude', I thought it seem like it would be an awfully strange and disgusting movie that I was easily going to hate, but I sat down with an open mind and found it to be (like I said) pretty fascinating. The weirdness of 'Harold and Maude' surrounds a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), who is royally and oddly obsessed with death. Some of his favorite hobbies are attending funerals of people who Harold doesn't even know and staging these fake suicide acts; like hanging himself on a noose, shooting himself, setting himself on fire, and so forth. He does those acts just to get a reaction from his mother (Vivian Pickles). What makes the movie even weirder is when Harold is attending a funeral and meets an 80-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who is obsessed with life. So, they start having this relationship with each other, and Harold starts to get a sense from her, which starts to change his own life forever. The main focus of this movie is the two main actors: Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both do a brilliant job interpreting the meaning of life and death. They both had great chemistry and they are both interesting characters. This movie has a dark sense of humor. There are scenes that make you laugh-out-loud just how odd they truly are. For instance, Harold's suicide acts, Maude stealing other people's vehicle, and what not. I know people are probably going to be quite offended by its humor, but maybe the others will be oddly amused by the humor, like I was. I loved the cinematography; it's some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring songs by Cat Stevens . . . what more do you need from a movie that has to do with life? The songs are just very meaningful and fit the themes perfectly. 10/10

    Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold (Bud Cort) finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral. My biggest problem with this film was the abuse of Cat Stevens. Did we need an entire soundtrack from him? No. Did we need to hear the same song three (or more) times? No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought. It gets more complicated when you make the friendship into a romantic bond -- was this a bad idea, a good idea, pushing the envelope or what?

    Twenty-year-old man finds his soul mate in 80-year-old woman. This is a movie of its time. The main point of the film is that eccentricity is good; authority is bad. As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

    I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother.

It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.

    This film is about a young man with a morbid fascination with death. He meets an 79 years old woman and connects with her in many ways. "Harold and Maude" begins with a suicide scene which is powerful and haunting. The shock of the suicide, and the even more shocking response of the mother makes "Harold and Maude" captivating right from the start. Harold's innovative ways to die continue to shock me, and I find myself screaming at the visually disturbing acts. The unlikely friendship with Maude is quite amazing, as they break social norms and bond because they really get along with each other. The ending is rather open, but I take it as Harold being transformed by Maude. "Harold and Maude" is not the usual comedy, it is very dark and yet engaging and captivating.

    This movie is sooo 1971 - and that is not a bad thing. It was directed by a member of "the greatest generation" (Hal Ashby) about a member of his parents' generation (Maude) helping a member of the baby boomers' generation (Harold) choose to seize life rather than go on embracing a kind of living death. The details of the film have been rehashed by several hundred previous reviewers, so I won't do that once again. I will point out that it is interesting that the intended audience for this film - the baby boomers of 1971 who were then in their teens and twenties who so embraced this film then and still do through all of the websites dedicated to its nostalgia - have become what they claimed to abhor in this movie over the last 35 years. They have, in fact, become the most prudish bunch of old people since the Puritans landed at Plymouth Rock. Their collective slogan has changed from "Let It All Hang Out" to "Let All Who Do Not Conform Be Hanged!". Thanks to the collective legislative efforts of the baby boomers - shortly to begin their second stint in diapers - we do not dare let a 20 year old (Harold's age in the movie) drink one beer even in the bedroom of his own house. We do not dare let bar owners allow smoking in their establishments by anyone no matter what their age, and worst of all the land is dotted with zero-tolerance policies in which a child who shows up to school with an unauthorized aspirin is often treated the same as a child who shows up to school with crack cocaine or a gun as far as expulsion goes. The point of my rant is this - If the Maude of the film were somehow brought back to life today, more than likely she would find Harold acting more like his mother than even his mother did and would likely want to take that handful of pills that ended her life a second time - for completely different reasons. This really is a great film, and I would really hope that when I am 79 I am a cross between the Maude of this movie and Einstein and his compadres in the film "IQ". More than that though, I watch this film to remind me how it is a daily battle to stay young at heart and open to the simple pleasures of life. A battle that so many of my older fellow baby boomers have long since lost.

    Everything about this show was great- the writing, the casting, the story, and, of course, Cat Stevens! This is one of the most uplifting stories ever. This is a story about life, love, and learning to love life, yourself, and others. It is about learning to grab life with both hands and experiencing as much as you can. The beginning is a little slow. There is nothing flashy at all about this movie. It is as straightforward as Maude. Unfortunately I have a feeling that the story would be lost on today's youth which is a true shame. This movie got me through some of my lowest points in life. It is tied with The Wall for my all-time favorite movie which is interesting because one would be hard-pressed to find two such diametrically opposed films. This is a "must see". If your spirit is in need of being lightened, then this is your movie. It delivers its message without being sappy, trite or overly sentimental.

    When I first heard about 'Harold and Maude', I thought it seem like it would be an awfully strange and disgusting movie that I was easily going to hate, but I sat down with an open mind and found it to be (like I said) pretty fascinating. The weirdness of 'Harold and Maude' surrounds a young man named Harold Chasen (Bud Cort), who is royally and oddly obsessed with death. Some of his favorite hobbies are attending funerals of people who Harold doesn't even know and staging these fake suicide acts; like hanging himself on a noose, shooting himself, setting himself on fire, and so forth. He does those acts just to get a reaction from his mother (Vivian Pickles). What makes the movie even weirder is when Harold is attending a funeral and meets an 80-year-old woman named Maude (Ruth Gordon), who is obsessed with life. So, they start having this relationship with each other, and Harold starts to get a sense from her, which starts to change his own life forever. The main focus of this movie is the two main actors: Ruth Gordon and Bud Cort. They both do a brilliant job interpreting the meaning of life and death. They both had great chemistry and they are both interesting characters. This movie has a dark sense of humor. There are scenes that make you laugh-out-loud just how odd they truly are. For instance, Harold's suicide acts, Maude stealing other people's vehicle, and what not. I know people are probably going to be quite offended by its humor, but maybe the others will be oddly amused by the humor, like I was. I loved the cinematography; it's some of the most beautiful cinematography I've seen. The soundtrack is simply awesome. Featuring songs by Cat Stevens . . . what more do you need from a movie that has to do with life? The songs are just very meaningful and fit the themes perfectly. 10/10

    Young, rich, and obsessed with death, Harold (Bud Cort) finds himself changed forever when he meets lively septuagenarian Maude (Ruth Gordon) at a funeral. My biggest problem with this film was the abuse of Cat Stevens. Did we need an entire soundtrack from him? No. Did we need to hear the same song three (or more) times? No. I am not opposed to Stevens and his music, but it never felt right and always brought me out of the film. Roger Ebert gave the film a lukewarm review, and I can sympathize. I love the concept of a man obsessed with death, and the suicide attempts were pure genius... even the idea of a young man who is turned on to life by someone who is elderly is a beautiful thought. It gets more complicated when you make the friendship into a romantic bond -- was this a bad idea, a good idea, pushing the envelope or what?

    Twenty-year-old man finds his soul mate in 80-year-old woman. This is a movie of its time. The main point of the film is that eccentricity is good; authority is bad. As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

As such, it became a cult favorite with the hippie generation, but it is a chore to sit through it now. Harold and Maude are two of the most self-absorbed characters in the history of cinema. They are meant to be endearing but are extremely annoying, particularly Maude, as she is played by Gordon, an actress with annoying mannerisms. The humor is forced and unfunny and the emotions are phony. The scenes featuring Pickles, as Harold's mother, provide very mild amusement. Everything else is lame.

    I remembered this very well from the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, and reading about the plot it sounded like a suitable film to be featured, and definitely one I was up for for trying, from director Hal Ashby (Being There). Basically Harold Chasen (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Bud Cort) is a wealthy twenty year old young man living a very unusual existence, he likes to attend (gatecrash) funerals, watch building demolitions, visit junkyards, and he is obsessed with death, including simulating suicide attempts to get attention from his snobbish mother Mrs. Chasen (Vivian Pickles), and he sees a psychologist. It is at a funeral that his life starts changing when he meets equally eccentric and anarchic seventy nine year old Maude (Rosemary's Baby's Golden Globe nominated Ruth Gordon) who has the opposite attitude to life, she takes every life as it comes and gives him a new zest for life, as they have lots of small adventures and fun together. While Harold's mother is trying to find him a woman he will eventually marry, inviting some to the house and all being scared away by his committing fake suicides, Harold as he spends time with her is finding a close connection with Maude. After three attempts at finding Harold a wife, and trying to get him to join the army like his father did, he comes to the decision that he is in love with and will be happy with Maude, so as her eightieth birthday approaches he plans to propose marriage, and he tells his disturbed mother this too, and he ends up seeing more psychologists who advise him against it. On the night of Maude's birthday she is given a surprise party, and she says she can't think of a better farewell, as she reveals she has overdosed on sleeping pills, she states that her age is the appropriate time to die, but he rushes her to hospital. In the end Maude is treated, but the attempt to save her is unsuccessful and she dies, and the final sequence sees Harold supposedly driving his car fast over a seaside cliff and crashing on the beach, but we see that he calmly sitting on the cliff with his banjo, and he dances away. Also starring Cyril Cusack as Glaucus, Charles Tyner as Uncle Victor, Ellen Geer as Sunshine Dor&eacute;, Judy Engles as Candy Gulf, Shari Summers as Edith Phern, Mousehunt's Eric Christmas as Priest and Alien's Tom Skerritt as Motorcycle Officer. Cort is brilliant with his almost completely expressionless performance as the depressed young man given a new lease on life, and of course Gordon is lovable as the old free spirit who lives life to the fullest and proves you can find love at any age, also worth mentioning is Pickles as the wonderfully snobbish, bored and ignorant mother. The moments that made me laugh the most were the teenager and his wacky fake suicides, obviously there are plenty of funny dark moments as well, but there are also the tender moments between the young man and the elderly woman, all in all it adds up to a great black comedy drama. It was number 45 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Very good!

    I am a teenager and my mother sat me down to watch this movie. I loved it. It was strange and ever so slightly outdated but its message and storyline was incredible. I feel in love with both characters and intrigue by their relationship. It was definitely worth watching and it should be more popular than it is. This will always be one of my favorites. The only downside to this movie was when I watched it my mother didn't tell me about the ending at all, so when it happened I burst out crying because it came as such a shock.

    Hal Ashby's 'Harold and Maude' fits into a genre of it's own. Too serious to be a comedy, and too funny to be a drama. The story centers around Harold (Bud Curt), a lonely and depressed teenager obsessed with staging fake suicides. In his spare time, he gets his kicks out of attending funerals, to people he has never seen or met. He befriends another frequent funeral attendee, Maude (Ruth Gordon), nearly his total opposite, an older woman who wants to get the most out of life. The script here is great. Taking somewhat of a lubricious subject matter, and making it completely believable. Ashby, the film's director, should also be credited, as the film is very vibrant and full of life. But, mostly, the film is carried by Curt and Gordon, who play off one another to nearly perfection. Their relationship never comes off as simplistic, as these actors add another layer to make it an even deeper and more fulfilling experience. The film's end, without giving it away, left me very disappointed. It's totally predictable, only to serve as melodrama and get an emotional reaction out of the audience. It really left a sour taste in my mouth when the film does wrap up, after the first hour and twenty-five minutes are very solid, then the last five minutes totally veers off the track. That aside, 'Harold and Maude' is an extremely charming film that holds up to is cult following. Worth seeing. 8/10

    I'm not entirely sure why this has such a high rating on this site. Harold and Maude is certainly a unique piece of work, but once you get past the novelty of a 79-year-old woman having a relationship that eventually turns sexual with a psychologically disturbed 19-year-old boy, this story is something of an old chestnut. After all, it's really just another tale of a repressed male who has his life turned around by a free-spirited female. Bud Cort and Ruth Gordon are surprisingly believable as the film's eponymous odd couple. Cort, looking about thirteen-years-old much of the time, has no trouble portraying a disturbed mind even when he's simply looking at another actor deliver their lines. Although the film's humour is extremely dark, it's careful to ensure Harold's problems can only ever be perceived as a humorous vehicle to enhance the life-affirming transformation he undergoes thanks to Maude. Gordon is wonderful as Maude, looking years younger than both her character's age and her own real age (about 75 when the film was shot). The film might make uncomfortable viewing for some, but it hasn't aged particularly well, and I suspect that future years won't be any kinder to it. Personally, I felt the story didn't really work because I never felt particularly close to the characters or their feelings, and because for most of the film they seem to live in some kind of cocoon, unseen by the rest of the world.
