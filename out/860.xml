    "The Believers" is a murder mystery thriller integrated with a pervasive voodoo horror scenario. Solid casting and smooth acting combined with fine cinematography and staging carry this movie along, making it reasonably compelling and competent. The greatest weakness lies in a story that has some implausible elements (coincidences), is at times contrived, and doesn't have enough twists to it. Martin Sheen is a police psychiatrist who gets called onto a case that involves the sacrificial slayings of several young boys. He himself has a young son (Harley Cross). He has lost his wife but maintains cordial relations with her parents. Sheen gets called in because a cop (Jimmie Smits) is severely disturbed over voodoo threats to his life that he perceives. Sheen sets out to find out what's going on, and that's where the mystery sets in as he uncovers the mysterious doings of Harris Yulin and his voodoo man (Malick Bowens). Richard Masur is a convenient lawyer friend of Sheen. Months pass and Sheen develops a romantic interest in Helen Shaver, who like Sheen and his son, become voodoo targets. Sheen's maid (Carmen Ruiz) provides some counter-voodoo mojo, but not enough. Being made in 1987, there are some shocking scenes that would never have been shown in movies of old. That changed certainly by the time of Alien (1979).

    Martin Sheen plays police psychologist Cal Jamison, who moves to New York with his young son after the sudden accidental death of his wife(vividly shown early on!) He soon is called into a case involving voodoo cult rituals involving the death of chickens, but soon discovers that they want to escalate things with sacrificing children, which will include his own son... Helen Shaver plays his potential love interest, who also becomes a target by the cult. Mediocre thriller has a sensational opening, but soon becomes overly convoluted and unbelievable, though the actors are fine, and director John Schlesinger does create some effective atmosphere, the problems are too many to overcome.

    Co-producer / director John Schlesinger of "Midnight Cowboy" fame is at the helm of this interesting film that takes a look into the religion of Santeria. Martin Sheen plays Cal Jamison, a police psychiatrist who moves with his young son Chris (Harley Cross) from Minnesota to New York after a horrible accident involving his wife. Soon they find that the terror isn't over as they get mixed up with various members of a cult that believes in the sacrifice of children. As in any film of this kind, it does get fascinating to see characters partake in rituals and utilize assorted items. The story is based on a novel by Nicholas Conde, condensed here by Mark Frost of 'Twin Peaks' fame, and it's fairly meaty stuff that runs close to two hours. It gets appropriately surreal and while it may not always make absolute sense, that isn't such a bad thing in a film of this kind. The cast is above average and quite convincing. Supporting Sheen are the lovely, under-rated Helen Shaver, and old pros such as Robert Loggia, Lee Richardson, Elizabeth Wilson, Harris Yulin, and Richard Masur. Jimmy Smits has a great, memorable, small but pivotal part as a detective who's part of the puzzle; he's found flying off the handle after being discovered at a murder scene. Also appearing are the excellent Raul Davila and the striking Malick Bowens; co-star Carla Pinza, who plays Carmen the housekeeper, was also the films' cultural adviser. Despite a deliberate pace, this story just draws the viewer right in with its weird atmosphere, attention to detail, and its sense of doom and gloom; after a while, one has to wonder if there is anyone that Cal can trust. The special effects are generally good, especially when insects emerge from a sore on a persons' face. The music by J. Peter Robinson is likewise good. The finale is well executed on impressive sets by Simon Holland and the cinematography is the work of the great Robby Muller. The characters are compelling; it's refreshing that our hero is not a perfect one. For one thing, he's prone to nasty outbursts. Worth a look overall; the finale would seem to be setting up a sequel but no sequel ever got made. For another look at Santeria, check out the 1972 film "The Possession of Joel Delaney". Seven out of 10.

    Wow is this movie dumb! You will hate the superstitious Latin characters they have running around yelling and carrying on in over the top Latin accents. Sheen is a concerned father and police detective investigation some child murders in NYC. These murders are linked to a voodoo/santoria type religion that seems to be 'believed' by an unbelievably big underground community in New York City! A scary black guy with albino contacts lurks around scaring the bejesus out of the increasingly frightened latins who can only speak broken English, shriek and writhe in increasing desperation for Sheen/someone/anyone to listen to them and their need for pro-tect-C-own. There are bizarre suicides, deaths, mind control trances (at just a glance), animal sacrifices, oh, and other European American believers who wear suits and ride around in limousines who are apparently in charge of this 'religion'. I also left out a kidnapping, curses, electrocutions, and Sheen's character's rebellious, uncontrollable little kid who is constantly in danger and behaves not unlike he's suddenly had a bad reaction to angel dust!

    John Schlesinger was best known for movies like "Darling", "Midnight Cowboy", "Sunday Bloody Sunday", "The Day of the Locust" and "Marathon Man". But now he directs something totally different. To understand what happens in "The Believers", it helps to have foreknowledge of Santer&iacute;a, a syncretic religion practiced widely in the Caribbean. It is based in the Yoruba culture (in present-day Nigeria), but includes influences from Roman Catholicism and the indigenous American cultures. The movie depicts a satanic offshoot of Santer&iacute;a mixed with brujer&iacute;a (Spanish for "witchcraft"), that is sacrificing children in New York, and is now targeting the son of Martin Sheen's character. If you expect a slasher movie, this is nothing of the sort. There is some violence, but no guts getting torn out or anything -- only one scene can truly get called shocking (you'll know it when you see it) -- and there's limited sex/nudity. I'd say that the movie's strength is its depiction of how Sheen's character slowly but surely learns about a culture with which he was previously unfamiliar. The movie does make clear that the religious cult is not Santer&iacute;a, but a different group. After all, every religion is bound to have its wackos. Does the movie have any downsides? Well, Robert Loggia's cop came across as a little silly, but I'd call that the only true downside. Otherwise, this is a good one. Also starring Helen Shaver, Richard Masur, Jimmy Smits and Harris Yulin (who I at first mistook for Richard Jenkins, aka Nate Sr. on "Six Feet Under").

    After the death of his wife, police psychiatrist Cal Jamison moves to New York. There he has to help in the investigation of the murder of two youths, who seem to have been immolated during a cult ritual. Jamison believes it's been Voodoo and, ignoring the warnings of his housekeeper, enters the scenery and soon gets under their influence. They try to get him to sacrifice his own son.... A very worthy and sometimes very unsettling thriller, that has to be seen to really appreciate the subject matter. Sheen excels as the doubting doctor, who has to contend with the loss of his wife, and bringing up his son alone. The film is quite long and can be slow at times, but this just adds to the tension, as Schlesinger has crafted a very unsettling beginning scene, which sets the tone for the rest of the film. The first act concentrates on Sheen and his coping mechanisms, but when Palo enters the US, the film goes for a more macabre turn. Pal is a convincing creation, but a lot of the time, he stands around looking like a lonely Terminator, which sorts of crushes his sinister side. As always with film like this, there is a little twist that throws the audience, and while it is explained well and the rationale justified, the final act is a little too obscure, but still very well made. I would have rated this higher, the narrative and all the performances are great, and it is very tense throughout, but the final scene, which to be fair, looks like it was thrown in for a final 'they could be still around' scene, is out of place in this, and kind of spoils the rest of the film. Do yourself a favour, and if you see this, turn it off when you see Sheen stroking the dog, you will appreciate it a lot more.

    Religion and Hollywood don't always make a great match. So often movies dealing with it lack accuracy, instead giving it a more style over substance treatment. Most of the time this has been successful in the Horror genre, like in classics such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Rosemary's Baby.' Children targeted by cults became a small trend in the 1980s. Based on a novel called 'The Religion' by Nicholas Conde, 'The Believers' is not in the same league as the films mentioned, but is not one to dismiss either. Pros: Solid work by the cast. Excellent, sometimes chilling score. Fabulous cinematography. Pretty suspenseful. Paces moves along fine most of the time. A few really good creepy sequences. A few good twists and turns. Feeling of doom hangs over the film. Cons: Midsection drags some. Script has some half-baked ideas. Little you haven't seen before. Lame ending that feels like it was tacked on. Final thoughts: Though not a great film, 'The Believers' is worlds better than a lot of genre films from the period. It's really nothing new, but is competent on most levels, which helps it stay afloat. If these kind of moves give you the chills then this is definitely up your alley. My rating: 3.5/5

    I was expecting some horror to be sure, I just was not expecting a full blown horror movie with some supernatural stuff thrown in to boot. I was more expecting a serious thriller dealing with cults or something. The movie seems to have a plot device similar to a Dean Koontz book I have heard about in that a cult is out to get the child of a man whose wife dies in a rather unpleasant way right at the beginning of the movie. The cult is sort of on the voodoo side of things and the movie has them doing things in their power to not only to sacrifice the guy's son, but to get him to do it. Add a bit more to it and you have yourself a really good horror movie. There still is a bit to much thriller and drama in it to be a really good horror movie though and I have never been wild about Martin Sheen. I actually always enjoyed watching his son's movies more. So in the end you get a movie that seems to not quite know what it really wants to be, but it had enough horror elements in it for me to overall enjoy.

    THE BELIEVERS is completely useless and fails as even a mild effort in entertainment. The work features a storyline that is loosely based upon horrors allegedly to be found within the Afro-Cuban belief system Santeria. As someone who is a friend of several houses in the tradition of Santeria, I was appalled by the bent of these film makers, which was the usual Hollywood crap. Suffice it to say that if a film this slanderous were made about the documented abuses and excesses of good old U.S. fundamentalist Christianity, those film makers would be excoriated on every talk show circuit between Honolulu and Pittsburgh. THE BELIEVERS is a stupid film, marketed towards people who already don't have any problems figuring out reasons to be afraid of the indigenous traditions of black and Latino folks in the Americas. Watch this if you must, but don't walk away from the premises of the film makers, which are embarrassingly racist.

THE BELIEVERS is a stupid film, marketed towards people who already don't have any problems figuring out reasons to be afraid of the indigenous traditions of black and Latino folks in the Americas. Watch this if you must, but don't walk away from the premises of the film makers, which are embarrassingly racist.

    I was expecting some horror to be sure, I just was not expecting a full blown horror movie with some supernatural stuff thrown in to boot. I was more expecting a serious thriller dealing with cults or something. The movie seems to have a plot device similar to a Dean Koontz book I have heard about in that a cult is out to get the child of a man whose wife dies in a rather unpleasant way right at the beginning of the movie. The cult is sort of on the voodoo side of things and the movie has them doing things in their power to not only to sacrifice the guy's son, but to get him to do it. Add a bit more to it and you have yourself a really good horror movie. There still is a bit to much thriller and drama in it to be a really good horror movie though and I have never been wild about Martin Sheen. I actually always enjoyed watching his son's movies more. So in the end you get a movie that seems to not quite know what it really wants to be, but it had enough horror elements in it for me to overall enjoy.

    "The Believers" is a murder mystery thriller integrated with a pervasive voodoo horror scenario. Solid casting and smooth acting combined with fine cinematography and staging carry this movie along, making it reasonably compelling and competent. The greatest weakness lies in a story that has some implausible elements (coincidences), is at times contrived, and doesn't have enough twists to it. Martin Sheen is a police psychiatrist who gets called onto a case that involves the sacrificial slayings of several young boys. He himself has a young son (Harley Cross). He has lost his wife but maintains cordial relations with her parents. Sheen gets called in because a cop (Jimmie Smits) is severely disturbed over voodoo threats to his life that he perceives. Sheen sets out to find out what's going on, and that's where the mystery sets in as he uncovers the mysterious doings of Harris Yulin and his voodoo man (Malick Bowens). Richard Masur is a convenient lawyer friend of Sheen. Months pass and Sheen develops a romantic interest in Helen Shaver, who like Sheen and his son, become voodoo targets. Sheen's maid (Carmen Ruiz) provides some counter-voodoo mojo, but not enough. Being made in 1987, there are some shocking scenes that would never have been shown in movies of old. That changed certainly by the time of Alien (1979).

    Martin Sheen plays police psychologist Cal Jamison, who moves to New York with his young son after the sudden accidental death of his wife(vividly shown early on!) He soon is called into a case involving voodoo cult rituals involving the death of chickens, but soon discovers that they want to escalate things with sacrificing children, which will include his own son... Helen Shaver plays his potential love interest, who also becomes a target by the cult. Mediocre thriller has a sensational opening, but soon becomes overly convoluted and unbelievable, though the actors are fine, and director John Schlesinger does create some effective atmosphere, the problems are too many to overcome.

    Co-producer / director John Schlesinger of "Midnight Cowboy" fame is at the helm of this interesting film that takes a look into the religion of Santeria. Martin Sheen plays Cal Jamison, a police psychiatrist who moves with his young son Chris (Harley Cross) from Minnesota to New York after a horrible accident involving his wife. Soon they find that the terror isn't over as they get mixed up with various members of a cult that believes in the sacrifice of children. As in any film of this kind, it does get fascinating to see characters partake in rituals and utilize assorted items. The story is based on a novel by Nicholas Conde, condensed here by Mark Frost of 'Twin Peaks' fame, and it's fairly meaty stuff that runs close to two hours. It gets appropriately surreal and while it may not always make absolute sense, that isn't such a bad thing in a film of this kind. The cast is above average and quite convincing. Supporting Sheen are the lovely, under-rated Helen Shaver, and old pros such as Robert Loggia, Lee Richardson, Elizabeth Wilson, Harris Yulin, and Richard Masur. Jimmy Smits has a great, memorable, small but pivotal part as a detective who's part of the puzzle; he's found flying off the handle after being discovered at a murder scene. Also appearing are the excellent Raul Davila and the striking Malick Bowens; co-star Carla Pinza, who plays Carmen the housekeeper, was also the films' cultural adviser. Despite a deliberate pace, this story just draws the viewer right in with its weird atmosphere, attention to detail, and its sense of doom and gloom; after a while, one has to wonder if there is anyone that Cal can trust. The special effects are generally good, especially when insects emerge from a sore on a persons' face. The music by J. Peter Robinson is likewise good. The finale is well executed on impressive sets by Simon Holland and the cinematography is the work of the great Robby Muller. The characters are compelling; it's refreshing that our hero is not a perfect one. For one thing, he's prone to nasty outbursts. Worth a look overall; the finale would seem to be setting up a sequel but no sequel ever got made. For another look at Santeria, check out the 1972 film "The Possession of Joel Delaney". Seven out of 10.

    Wow is this movie dumb! You will hate the superstitious Latin characters they have running around yelling and carrying on in over the top Latin accents. Sheen is a concerned father and police detective investigation some child murders in NYC. These murders are linked to a voodoo/santoria type religion that seems to be 'believed' by an unbelievably big underground community in New York City! A scary black guy with albino contacts lurks around scaring the bejesus out of the increasingly frightened latins who can only speak broken English, shriek and writhe in increasing desperation for Sheen/someone/anyone to listen to them and their need for pro-tect-C-own. There are bizarre suicides, deaths, mind control trances (at just a glance), animal sacrifices, oh, and other European American believers who wear suits and ride around in limousines who are apparently in charge of this 'religion'. I also left out a kidnapping, curses, electrocutions, and Sheen's character's rebellious, uncontrollable little kid who is constantly in danger and behaves not unlike he's suddenly had a bad reaction to angel dust!

    John Schlesinger was best known for movies like "Darling", "Midnight Cowboy", "Sunday Bloody Sunday", "The Day of the Locust" and "Marathon Man". But now he directs something totally different. To understand what happens in "The Believers", it helps to have foreknowledge of Santer&iacute;a, a syncretic religion practiced widely in the Caribbean. It is based in the Yoruba culture (in present-day Nigeria), but includes influences from Roman Catholicism and the indigenous American cultures. The movie depicts a satanic offshoot of Santer&iacute;a mixed with brujer&iacute;a (Spanish for "witchcraft"), that is sacrificing children in New York, and is now targeting the son of Martin Sheen's character. If you expect a slasher movie, this is nothing of the sort. There is some violence, but no guts getting torn out or anything -- only one scene can truly get called shocking (you'll know it when you see it) -- and there's limited sex/nudity. I'd say that the movie's strength is its depiction of how Sheen's character slowly but surely learns about a culture with which he was previously unfamiliar. The movie does make clear that the religious cult is not Santer&iacute;a, but a different group. After all, every religion is bound to have its wackos. Does the movie have any downsides? Well, Robert Loggia's cop came across as a little silly, but I'd call that the only true downside. Otherwise, this is a good one. Also starring Helen Shaver, Richard Masur, Jimmy Smits and Harris Yulin (who I at first mistook for Richard Jenkins, aka Nate Sr. on "Six Feet Under").

    After the death of his wife, police psychiatrist Cal Jamison moves to New York. There he has to help in the investigation of the murder of two youths, who seem to have been immolated during a cult ritual. Jamison believes it's been Voodoo and, ignoring the warnings of his housekeeper, enters the scenery and soon gets under their influence. They try to get him to sacrifice his own son.... A very worthy and sometimes very unsettling thriller, that has to be seen to really appreciate the subject matter. Sheen excels as the doubting doctor, who has to contend with the loss of his wife, and bringing up his son alone. The film is quite long and can be slow at times, but this just adds to the tension, as Schlesinger has crafted a very unsettling beginning scene, which sets the tone for the rest of the film. The first act concentrates on Sheen and his coping mechanisms, but when Palo enters the US, the film goes for a more macabre turn. Pal is a convincing creation, but a lot of the time, he stands around looking like a lonely Terminator, which sorts of crushes his sinister side. As always with film like this, there is a little twist that throws the audience, and while it is explained well and the rationale justified, the final act is a little too obscure, but still very well made. I would have rated this higher, the narrative and all the performances are great, and it is very tense throughout, but the final scene, which to be fair, looks like it was thrown in for a final 'they could be still around' scene, is out of place in this, and kind of spoils the rest of the film. Do yourself a favour, and if you see this, turn it off when you see Sheen stroking the dog, you will appreciate it a lot more.

    Religion and Hollywood don't always make a great match. So often movies dealing with it lack accuracy, instead giving it a more style over substance treatment. Most of the time this has been successful in the Horror genre, like in classics such as 'The Exorcist' and 'Rosemary's Baby.' Children targeted by cults became a small trend in the 1980s. Based on a novel called 'The Religion' by Nicholas Conde, 'The Believers' is not in the same league as the films mentioned, but is not one to dismiss either. Pros: Solid work by the cast. Excellent, sometimes chilling score. Fabulous cinematography. Pretty suspenseful. Paces moves along fine most of the time. A few really good creepy sequences. A few good twists and turns. Feeling of doom hangs over the film. Cons: Midsection drags some. Script has some half-baked ideas. Little you haven't seen before. Lame ending that feels like it was tacked on. Final thoughts: Though not a great film, 'The Believers' is worlds better than a lot of genre films from the period. It's really nothing new, but is competent on most levels, which helps it stay afloat. If these kind of moves give you the chills then this is definitely up your alley. My rating: 3.5/5

    THE BELIEVERS is completely useless and fails as even a mild effort in entertainment. The work features a storyline that is loosely based upon horrors allegedly to be found within the Afro-Cuban belief system Santeria. As someone who is a friend of several houses in the tradition of Santeria, I was appalled by the bent of these film makers, which was the usual Hollywood crap. Suffice it to say that if a film this slanderous were made about the documented abuses and excesses of good old U.S. fundamentalist Christianity, those film makers would be excoriated on every talk show circuit between Honolulu and Pittsburgh.

    I was expecting some horror to be sure, I just was not expecting a full blown horror movie with some supernatural stuff thrown in to boot. I was more expecting a serious thriller dealing with cults or something. The movie seems to have a plot device similar to a Dean Koontz book I have heard about in that a cult is out to get the child of a man whose wife dies in a rather unpleasant way right at the beginning of the movie. The cult is sort of on the voodoo side of things and the movie has them doing things in their power to not only to sacrifice the guy's son, but to get him to do it. Add a bit more to it and you have yourself a really good horror movie. There still is a bit to much thriller and drama in it to be a really good horror movie though and I have never been wild about Martin Sheen. I actually always enjoyed watching his son's movies more. So in the end you get a movie that seems to not quite know what it really wants to be, but it had enough horror elements in it for me to overall enjoy.
