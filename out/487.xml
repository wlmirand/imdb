  Princess Anne embarks on a highly publicized tour of European capitals. When she and her royal entourage arrive in Rome, she begins to rebel against her restricted, regimented schedule.

She is found by Joe Bradley, an American newspaper reporter stationed in Rome. He takes her back to his apartment. The next morning Joe dashes off to cover the Princess Anne press conference, unaware that she is sleeping on his couch. Once he realizes his good fortune, Joe promises his editor an exclusive interview with the Princess.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

    While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

    If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    grace of Audrey Hepburn presence. grace of story. grace of science of detail. and metamorphose of old princess myth. nothing else. a pure joy. and magnificent masterpiece in which humor, tension and admirable end are parts of beautiful homage to Rome. because Rome is central character and first actor. a Rome in romantic clothes but seductive arena of a love story very strange for our time. because its heart is pure joy. because the cocktail between play, discover of different aspects of ordinary life, the trip in city, Boca de la Verita and fight scenes as new versions of mute film are precious jewels. it is a really delight. but more. a way to define a time as mirror of present. to show the glamor of Hollywood and performance of remarkable cast, to understand the magic presence of Hepburn and the ironic -wise work of Peck. and to live the charm of another fairy - tale.

The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

    While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

    If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads.

Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

    While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

    If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    grace of Audrey Hepburn presence. grace of story. grace of science of detail. and metamorphose of old princess myth. nothing else. a pure joy. and magnificent masterpiece in which humor, tension and admirable end are parts of beautiful homage to Rome. because Rome is central character and first actor. a Rome in romantic clothes but seductive arena of a love story very strange for our time. because its heart is pure joy. because the cocktail between play, discover of different aspects of ordinary life, the trip in city, Boca de la Verita and fight scenes as new versions of mute film are precious jewels. it is a really delight. but more. a way to define a time as mirror of present. to show the glamor of Hollywood and performance of remarkable cast, to understand the magic presence of Hepburn and the ironic -wise work of Peck. and to live the charm of another fairy - tale.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

    While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

    If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome.

The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.

    "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954) were Audrey Hepburns two best movies....but "Roman Holiday" was the best of the two. Both movies were about royalty and servants interacting, intriguing, scheming, always in interesting settings beautifully presented. The audience gets to see where royalty in both Rome and New York City work and play and "do their thing" with the help of very smart, self-interested servants. The two movies are packed with actor talent. Audrey Hepburn, Gregory Peck, Humphry Bogart, and William Holden were all Best Actor/Actress Academy Award winners, assisted with wonderful support from old time actor pros including Eddie Albert, Walter Hampton, and Francis X. Bushman (who co-starred in the "Ben Hur" Ramon Navarro silent spic in 1923). Both screenplays are interesting, well written, and present a story line totally unpredictable and compelling. The reason "Roman Holiday" (1953) is the best of the two wonderful movies is the difference between New York City and Rome. New York City isn't beautiful, and Rome is. At least the way these two great movies show the two cities (I was born in NYC and lived there.....I know NYC has its good points). The royalty shown in Rome know and love good art, dance, and varied good times, and take the time off from their burdens to taste those things. The "royalty" shown in New York City (the "Larrabee" family industrialist millionaire socialites....America's version of "royalty") are dull, efficiency expert, profit hungry machines who object to beauty and loveliness, and try to assassinate it (her) when it (she)...."Sabrina" played by the incredible Audrey Hepburn....gets in their way. Roman royalty (played by Hepburn) is better than USA royalty (played by Bogart and family). Hepburn comes out on the good side in both movies...classy princess in one and classy servant in the other, and was never better in her entire actor career. But her "Roman Holiday" (1953) movie was the best of all. She played "good royalty" (with good values) in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and a "good servant chauffeur's daughter training to become a cook" in "Sabrina" (1954). A role model lady for all to see and savor, the likes of whom have seldom ever been portrayed as well, or with as much class (in both movies) as in "Roman Holiday" (1953) and "Sabrina" (1954). ----------- Written by Tex Allen, SAG Actor.

    Roman Holiday is a romantic comedy directed and produced by William Wyler. It stars Gregory Peck as a reporter and Audrey Hepburn as a royal princess out to see Rome on her own. The screenplay and costume design also won. It was written by John Dighton and Dalton Trumbo, though with Trumbo on the Hollywood blacklist, he did not receive a credit; instead, Ian McLellan Hunter fronted for him. Trumbo's credit was reinstated when the film was released on DVD in 2003 and in 2011, full credit for Trumbo's work was restored.Eddie Albert,Hartley Power,Harcourt Williams,Margaret Rawlings,Tullio Carminati,Paola Borboni and Laura Solari co-star to play key supporting roles. Princess Anne is weary of protocol and anxious to have some fun before she is mummified by "affairs of state". On a diplomatic visit to Rome, Anne escapes her royal retainers and scampers incognito through the Eternal City. She happens to meet American journalist Joe Bradley, who recognizing a hot news story, pretends that he doesn't recognize her and offers to give her a guided tour of Rome. Naturally, Joe hopes to get an exclusive interview, while his photographer pal Irving attempts to sneak a photo. And just as naturally, Joe falls in love with her. The film itself is a classic of romantic wish fulfillment, exactly the sort of beautiful lie that Hollywood specialized in.Audrey Hepburn gives the popular old romantic nonsense a reality it has seldom had before.Maybe it doesn't quite live up to its sterling reputation, and maybe the leading man and director were slightly miscast. But who cares? Roman Holiday is the film that brought Hepburn to prominence, and the world movie audience went weak at the knees.That is why it was a great fun watching as the location shooting is irresistible, and Hepburn embodies an image of chic style that would rule for the rest of the 1950's.Finally, this romantic comedy ranks as one of the most enjoyable films of all times.

    grace of Audrey Hepburn presence. grace of story. grace of science of detail. and metamorphose of old princess myth. nothing else. a pure joy. and magnificent masterpiece in which humor, tension and admirable end are parts of beautiful homage to Rome. because Rome is central character and first actor. a Rome in romantic clothes but seductive arena of a love story very strange for our time. because its heart is pure joy. because the cocktail between play, discover of different aspects of ordinary life, the trip in city, Boca de la Verita and fight scenes as new versions of mute film are precious jewels. it is a really delight. but more. a way to define a time as mirror of present. to show the glamor of Hollywood and performance of remarkable cast, to understand the magic presence of Hepburn and the ironic -wise work of Peck. and to live the charm of another fairy - tale.

    Hollywood Glamour has never permeated in a film's atmosphere as the films of William Wyler or Audrey Hepburn. The latter figure has especially been idolized to the max by pop culture, which has caused an over-exposure of the movies she's starred in, such as "Breakfast At Tiffany's", and the movie at hand, "Roman Holiday", in which she co-stars with another Hollywood icon Gregory Peck. During a European tour, a young princess arrives at Rome to attend various royal ceremonies: it is apparent from the beginning however that she just wants to be a normal person and do normal things. So, she escapes the villa she's been welcomed in, and wanders through the city at night. She meets an American journalist who gives her a place to stay for the night. When he comes to find out she's the princess visiting the city, he tries to exploit her for an article, but he falls for her instead. One of those films that emphasizes romance and glamour over plot and character development: what seems to matter the most here are the sparks between Peck and Hepburn, the comedy, and the romanticized portrayal of Rome. It's a film for the people who are interested in seeing what was so great about Audrey Hepburn- who of course has the charms and looks of an angel-, and it certainly doesn't disappoint on that account. But the film's narrative progression does feel outdated and flawed, causing a quasi-somnolent flow to the film. Nevertheless, it's a handsome movie full of glitter.

    While I know that I'm in the minority here, I found this 1953 film to be utterly boring.Audrey Hepburn won an undeserved Oscar here for her role as a bored princess who runs away to find love with a newspaper reporter, the always reliable Gregory Peck. Hepburn was far better the following year in "Sabrina," for which she was again nominated. Of course, she should have won easily for "The Nun's Story," in 1959 and gave another great performance as a blind woman victimized by thieves in 1967's "Wait Until Dark," her final Oscar bid. How the Academy ignored Barbara Stanwyck's phenomenal performance in 1953's "Titanic" was beyond me. To add insult to injury, Stanwyck wasn't even nominated along with the equally great Clifton Webb. "Roman Holiday" had magnificent cinematography and that was about it. To me, Hepburn was often childish in the film and that scene in the cave was just a little too much for me. Eddie Albert received a best supporting Oscar bid here and I think only the Lord knows why. His chance for Oscar was foiled two years later when he failed to be nominated for his memorable turn as Burt McGuire in the magnificent "I'll Cry Tomorrow." "Roman Holiday" should have been in color. This really would have uplifted the great cinematography.

    This sparkling movie turns a royal tour into a very funny behind-the-scenes romance after a glorious, wedding cake opening. Audrey Hepburn as the princess of a small country plays the role of a royal icon on a visit to Rome. The royal visitor manages to escape for some fun with journalist Joe Bradley (Gregory Peck) and photographer Irving Radovich (Eddie Albert). Made shortly after a youthful Elizabeth II came to the throne of Great Britain, this movie shows how public and media fawned over young royals. To a large extent, this is still as true as ever. A number of vignettes liven up this wonderful romantic comedy. The shoe scene is a light treatment of the perfection required by royals at every public moment. The hand in the mouth of the ogre gag is nicely pulled off by Gregory Peck. A night out dancing by the Tiber turns into a hilarious brawl. The spontaneous decision to have a haircut turns into a delightful change of hairstyle for the young princess. The show is still enjoyable today because royal ornamentation is always stunning and the story is a classic. Filmed entirely in Rome, the DVD version I saw is sharp in black and white with landmarks like the Spanish Steps and the Trevi Fountain making grand backgrounds as action takes the viewer from palace to marketplace to bachelor apartment. This has to be one of Audrey Hepburn's signature roles, even though she was very young. Peck had already made his mark but is still youthful enough to pursue the princess. He is a great actor who always seemed to move and perform almost effortlessly in his early roles during the forties and fifties, as he does in this one. Eddie Albert is outstanding as his press buddy assigned to the royal tour. Another achievement in the great body of work by director William Wyler.

    The film comes off oddly credible despite depicting a time when journalists weren't bereft of morals and romance consisted of more than getting drunk at a Jersey Shore club for a few hours together before having sex. Audrey Hepburn exudes girlish charm and doesn't reflexively show us her navel in every scene as she would have to if this were a modern film. Gregory Peck actually plays someone on the horns of a moral dilemma instead of someone who simply follows where the money takes him. You get the sense that in 1953 Italy an English princess could still just about disappear on the streets instead of being torn apart as today's huddled masses would. In short, this breezy, beautiful shot romantic comedy stands as testament to the decline of Western civilization and some of those things that were once good about it.

    If you are a sucker for a 1950's romantic comedy like I am, than you will adore this film. Audrey Hepburn's charm shines in this 1953 Oscar winning film. This coming of age movie reminds us to take time for ourselves to remember who we really are and to follow our hearts once in a while. Hepburn plays a sheltered young Princess Anne whose life is structured and planned down to the very last second by her royal staff. While on the Rome stop of a goodwill tour of Europe, the stress of her controlled life finally gets to her. She is given a shot to help calm her down and sleep but before feeling the full effects of the drug, she sneaks out of her room and into the night streets of Rome. Gregory Peck plays a tall dark and handsome struggling American reporter stationed in Rome named Joe Bradley. After a late night of cards, he stumbles upon Princess Anne sleeping on the streets. He attempts to help the young lady home, not yet knowing of her royal status, but realizes she is far to intoxicated to help herself so he brings her to his apartment to sleep it off on his couch. It's not until the next day that Joe realizes that he has the biggest story of his career sleeping in his apartment. He encourages Anne to spend the day out doing everything and anything she has ever wanted to do, all the while Anne thinks she has fooled Joe into thinking she is Anne Smith, the student, but Joe's intentions are to sell his princess story to the press. As the day goes by, he realizes that this private day they have shared means more to him than the price he would get for the story. Spoiler! Anne's day in Rome with Joe helps her discover herself in more ways than she expected. She lives, laughs, and loves her way through Rome with Joe by her side. Most of the scenes with Anne and Joe are shot from a lower angle, I believe this was done to make Joe appear taller and more like a protector to Anne. But, like Cinderella, Anne rushes back by midnight to her royal responsibilities and she must say goodbye to her beloved Joe. In the closing scene, Joe is walking out of the royal press conference being held in a lavish and large room. You see the empty throne over his shoulder getting further and further away. He stops at the end of the room and looks over his shoulder. This signifies the distance and impossibility of his relationship with Princess Anne. The movie is only shot over a 3 day period but you feel as though you have witnessed Anne grow up in front of your eyes from a spoiled Princess to a lovely young woman.

    An overprotected princess travels to Rome, where she befriends an American journalist ... that's the story told in William Wyler's Roman Holiday (1953), a romantic comedy classic starring Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. It is a tender story that is about the desire you have to find the person who you really are, your desire to get out of social pressures and be yourself. It is narrated in a linear fashion and we see how the characters evolve throughout history, learn through everything they live. The story is simple and flows through the personality of the characters, how they react to the situations they face. We see the characters astonished to do things for the first time, go through changes to start over, trying to be someone else for people to accept them for who they really are ... all to finally build confidence and trust. It's a movie that offers a glimpse into the life of a person "lucky" by his social position, which apparently seem more extraordinary and simple for the luxuries and comforts, but despite that fails to be happy and admire the grandeur of the life "common", is surprised by what others do may seem ordinary. While Wyler directs this classic with great performances of Hepburn and Peck, in this story that could be a rare version of "Cinderella" but that account so that the characters generate empathy with the viewer and make him spend some quality time.

    This is a very delightful movie about a young princess who, tiring from her perfect life, escapes one day from her palace and the journalist who finds her. On recognizing that this can be the scoop of a lifetime, he hides her identity and they proceed to spend a truly memorable time in the streets and among the monuments of Rome. They are accompanied by his friend who is a photographer. Hepburn won an Oscar for her portrayal of the princess but for me Gregory Peck was the best part of the movie. He is excellent in the comic scenes and truly mind blowing in the romantic ones. The scenes are shot lovingly and the direction by Wyler who would go on to create the epic Ben Hur six years down the line is masterly.The one scene which still lingers in my mind is the first kiss between the two leads. It will give you goosebumps. This is a true classic, one which hasn't lost its magnificence even 70 years down the line. 4 out of 5 for this. Very highly recommended for all the rom-com lovers.
