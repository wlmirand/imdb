    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result.

I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done.

There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date.

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

    Exquisite and yet dark, pungent, unforgiving. The best, the most cinematic kind of period drama since Visconti's "Senso'. Martin Scorsese is, without question, the master of his generation. After his dark paintings of New York, the New York of "Taxi Driver" or "The King Of Comedy" this look back at a time when not just New York, but America was defining its identity. Daniel Day Lewis is sublime and Michelle Pfeiffer gives the performance of her life. I was also profoundly moved for that glimpse of Alexis Smith in her last film appearance and the wonderful voice of Joanne Woodward narrating Edith Wharton's words. Thank you!

    In the early nineties Martin Scorsese's reputation was largely that of a maker of tough, gritty and violent films about the underworld or modern-day urban street life, often with a maladjusted, anti-social loner at their heart. He had, admittedly, made occasional films on other subjects, notably "The Last Temptation of Christ", but even so he was not the most likely candidate to direct an adaptation, in best Merchant-Ivory "heritage cinema" style, of a novel by Edith Wharton. "The Age of Innocence" was to reveal him as a more versatile director than many had hitherto realised. "Heritage cinema" is often regarded as something uniquely British, although this is a misconception; there are, for example, a number of fine French examples. A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.

    Martin Scorsese time travels to New York, 1870, to depict a period piece of romantic proportions and to ensure his versatility as a director. Scorsese is a historian when it comes to the setting of any of his films. "The Age of Innocence" is one of his most refined movies. The d&eacute;cor of the 19th century, the languages and accents of its people, and even the fine dining instruments are all accounted for. In many ways, Scorsese's eye for detail is a wakeup call for contemporary New Yorkers today. The Age of Innocence is meaningful in title and it acts as a precursor, in Scorsese-lore, to the myriad of other New York pictures the director would collect in his repertoire. Newland Archer (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a humble New Yorker and a lawyer in his profession. It is a profession that rivals entrepreneurs, aristocrats, bankers, and architects; there is no hostility among the men, but they fraternize as if they were Gods. Although Archer appears well situated and indignant, he is actually suffering profusely inside from the suffocation and inexorable norms of "high society". This characterization fits well with Scorsese's usual motifs. In "The Age of Innocence", Newland Archer is an insider looking out. One of the "outsiders" that catches Archer's attention is Countess Ellen Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer), the cousin of his fianc&eacute; May (Winona Ryder). Ellen flouts high society and as a result is the topic of malevolent gossip that pervades the closely knit families. Archer falls for Ellen but cannot abandon his feelings (or image) for May Welland. Matters complicate when Ellen wishes to divorce her husband and Archer must facilitate the separation with legality. Between all of these stressful emotions, he only wants to be with and to love Ellen until the very end. But reality is merciless. Ellen remains an angelical dream to Archer throughout the film. He goes on with his duties deadpanned. All the while Ellen slips in and out of his desires. But there is a problem here. Day-Lewis and Pfeiffer never convinced me that they were truly radiant for each other. Perhaps that's how extra-marital affairs were run in the "old fashioned days"inconspicuous and strained. But Archer's affections for Ellen to endure a lifetime (even after having many children) become too Shakespearean even for Scorsese to translate. Ellen became an alibi for Archer to leave the life of ritzy, high society. Nevertheless, "The Age of Innocence" will not disappoint any Scorsese fan. It's pleasant to the eye, and the aesthetics of the camera movement (from the graceful tracking shots to the zoom ins) are unusually effective in illustrating a period piece stereotyped for BBC territory. Despite being a period piece, the themes here are also relative to Scorsese (from the social outcast to the importance of family). I think Scorsese effectively created a film that embodied some of New York's oldest social statuses. It was the constipated love story that hampered Scorsese's direction. Maybe unrequited love is universal, but this is the age of innocence.

    An adaptation of Edith Wharton's 1920 novel of the same name, Martin Scorsese's 'The Age of Innocence' is A Masterpiece! A heart-breaking, devastating film that depicts love & betrayal magnificently. 'The Age of Innocence' Synopsis: Tale of 19th century New York high society in which a young lawyer falls in love with a woman separated from her husband, while he is engaged to the woman's cousin. 'The Age of Innocence' is master-class filmmaking. Scorsese is an impeccable Story-Teller & 'The Age of Innocence' is amongst his greatest films to date. He narrates a story that is heart-breaking & equally devastating. His conviction & self-confidence, however, empowers the film & takes it to an all-time high. The Adapted Screenplay Written by Scorsese himself & Jay Cocks, is magnificent. Cinematography is elegant. Editing is crisp. Art & Costume Design are marvelous. Performance-Wise: Daniel Day-Lewis is restrained. Winona Ryder is splendid. She delivers a career best performance. Michelle Pfeiffer is outstanding. Miriam Margolyes is effective. Jonathan Pryce & Michael Gough are dignified. On the whole, 'The Age of Innocence' is unmissable cinema!

    The Age of Innocence is centered within the "cr&egrave;me de la cr&egrave;me" of New York's society during the second half of the nineteenth century. There is absolutely no scarcity of means for its dwellers. They lunch, dine and amuse themselves almost like royalty. The meals are divided in many courses, they are always wearing tuxedos and ball dresses, the gentlemen change their pair of gloves for each lady they waltz with. But there seems to be a price for such an exquisite way of living. The uneasiness of the story begins when Newland Archer (Daniel Day Lewis), already groomed to the fresh young, loving May Welland (Winona Ryder), begins to tilt his attraction for Countess Olenska (Michelle Pfeiffer) who has just arrived from Europe, after splitting with her husband. The matter is that Mrs Olenska, although having lived in New York before marring, never really got used to its usages. Also, her possible divorce seems to hang over the entire society as a true scandal. For his part, Newland accepts her misfortune and understands it as a challenge to the solid old conventions they all endure. Thus, the natural, slight, almost unperceivable, retraction everybody seems have towards the Countess is nonexistent within Newland. This boundless relation between them allows him to envisage her as an escape from a living he soon describes as the taste of "cinders in his mouth". The Age of Innocence is about incarceration without bars, at least for the protagonist. He lives on a society where people have "no character, no colour, no variety", where they cannot truly speak their minds. When Newland realizes he is in love for the Countess, and starts to act like it, all this society moves discreetly and almost imperceptibly to prevent him from reaching his goal. In spite of this general effort, Archer is not prevented solely by his peers, but ultimately due his and the Countess's countenance. Chance also plays a part on this decorum prevention, as it happens on the beautiful lighthouse scene. This movie is also, and mostly, about choices, and the right ones. Much later, when the whole stillborn romance is over for all, we are somehow struck with the summing up of Archer's life, and the positive outcome that he kept the respect for his wife, family and even for himself, by refusing to be subdued to what could have been the great love of his life, and, simultaneously, the rejection of his entire self as how he lived it. In the end we are granted with the notion that life doesn't resume only to passionate love above all else. The inevitable association is with that scene on "Closer" when Natalie Portman's character, on knowing Jude Law's betrayal, says to him: "There's a moment, there's always a moment, "I can do this, I can give into this, or I can resist it"". Closer's protagonist gave in, Newland Archer did not. Another obligatory comparison is with "The Bridges of Madison County". On this movie Maryl Streep's character, married for many years, is bound in a few days long romance. Much later, when she dies and her already grown up daughter searches through her mother's closed-for-decades trunk, the most precious things to be found are the letters exchanged by the deceased and her mistress. "The Bridges of Madison County" presents upside-down, implausible, ethics, as the woman keep on being married, sharing a whole life together with her husband, but, alas, the altar of her existence rests on a weekend affair. Therefore, on "The Age of Innocence" the protagonist follows an entirely different path, much more credible by all means, as his lustful aspirations are sublimated throughout his marriage, full of its typical nuances, hardships and achievements that keeps binding the two of them together. This is what coming of age really is about!

A number of Americans have played a part in the development of the genre in Britain; James Ivory is American by birth, as was Joseph Losey who directed one of the earliest examples of the style, "The Go-Between". "The House of Mirth" (also based on a Wharton novel) is a film in this style on an American subject, but made in Britain by a British director, Terence Davis. "The Age of Innocence", by contrast, is a piece of genuinely American heritage cinema, although several of the cast are British or Irish. The story is set among the affluent classes of 1870s New York. Newland Archer is a lawyer engaged to be married to the beautiful young socialite May Welland but who finds himself attracted to May's cousin, Countess Ellen Olenska. Ellen is something of a controversial figure in New York's high society. She is separated from her abusive and unfaithful husband, a Polish count. Worse still, rumour has it that she herself has had an adulterous affair with her husband's (male) secretary. Newland first meets Ellen when she consults his firm about a possible divorce, although she eventually decides not to go through with it in order to spare her family further scandal. (Although American law at this period permitted divorce, American high society strongly disapproved of it). As their friendship deepens into love, Newland has to decide whether to follow the desires of his heart or the expectations of society. When I first saw this film in the cinema, back in 1993, I remember thinking that Newland must be mad if he could contemplate leaving the lovely Winona Ryder, with her fragile, haunting beauty, even for someone as undoubtedly attractive as Michelle Pfeiffer. I must say that my wife is still of that opinion, but having seen the film again recently I began to understand his feelings more. Ryder's May, for all her loveliness, is someone who comes across as shallow, conventional and slightly dull. Pfeiffer's Ellen, by contrast, is a woman of greater maturity, experience and worldly wisdom. Her air of exoticism and sophistication might make her suspect in the eyes of society, but it is precisely these characteristics which make her so fascinating to Newland. Newland is not what I have come to think of as a typical Daniel Day-Lewis character. Perhaps there is no such thing as a "typical Day-Lewis character", but the roles I most associate him with are those where he has to play individuals who are angry, outspoken or in some respect social outsiders. In some cases these figures are excluded from society by causes beyond their control, such as Christy Brown in "My Left Foot", excluded by his disabilities, or Gerry Conlan in "In the Name of the Father", excluded by an unjust conviction for a crime he did not commit, or Hawkeye in "The Last of the Mohicans", who feels more at home in Indian society than in the white society to which he belongs by birth. In other cases, however, he plays characters who can be considered anti-social personalities, such as Bill the Butcher in "Gangs of New York" (also made by Scorsese) and Plainview in "There Will Be Blood". In this film, however, Day-Lewis shows his versatility by playing a man who is very much a social insider, one who is fascinated by social outsiders like Ellen but who fears becoming an outsider himself. There is, in fact, some very subtle acting from all three of the leads. Pfeiffer also showed her versatility; her two previous roles before this one, Catwoman in "Batman" and the blue-collar housewife Lurene in "Love Field" had been about as different from Countess Olenska as one could imagine, although she had earlier played another period-drama heroine in "Dangerous Liaisons". The film's only acting Oscar nomination, however, went to Ryder for "Best Supporting Actress", which I felt was appropriate. Although May is the quietest of the three main characters, she is very much at the heart of the drama. (The "innocence" of the novel's title surely refers to her). As the film develops we realise that she might, in fact, be less naive and superficial, and more strong and determined, than she initially seems, making her a surprisingly complex character, and all these complexities are inherent in Ryder's performance. Another good performance in a supporting role comes from Miriam Margolyes as May's formidable grandmother Mrs. Mingott The film is visually sumptuous with strong, bright colours, especially reds, pinks, yellows and greens, much in evidence. Again, these are qualities one would not automatically associate with Scorsese's earlier works, which were often visually dark. ("Raging Bull", for example, was largely shot in black-and-white). Since 1993, however, these qualities have been seen in some of his later works, especially his other period dramas "Gangs of New York" and "The Aviator". "The Age of Innocence" can be seen as a fine example of Scorsese's skills as a film-maker. It is not entirely typical of his work- there is less physical action than in many of his films- but it perhaps seems less untypical today than it did in 1993. 8/10

    This tale is gripping, tantalizing and intriguing. However, it is very sad. Essentially the main characters work against what their gut, what their heart tells them to. In the end they choose blending in with the crowd to live bland, fake lives. They live in hypocrisy out of fear of what others will think. You watch in hopes they will do themselves a favor, but they never do. Behind the scenes they desire to live in truth, but they never do, which leaves for a miserable and empty ending that favors "duty" above all else. It is extremely painful to watch all the opportunities that Newland could have taken to get out of the lie he was living... that he either misses or attempts to take too late. He is engaged, he can get out of it, because he is miserable and loves someone else... but he denies it. He gets married and has many an opportunity early on to admit to himself before it's too late that he's made a mistake. When you get to a point when you wish your wife would catch a death of cold and die, you know things are going wrong. Then ... May gets pregnant. At risk of being a jerk, he gives up on the idea of letting May go. He loves his children, grows to love and miss May, but in the end he knows still that his life is blending in and based on lies. He has one final opportunity after May has passed on (even encouraged by his son) to UNDER HONEST CIRCUMSTANCES see if she would give him a chance, but he would rather remember how she was than see how she is and give himself a chance at honest happiness. How would I describe it overall? Heartbreaking.

    Scorsese has made a audio novel with pictures. So very little action happens, the movie could as readily been a series of still shots. Almost anything of import is narrated of over shots of ornate dinnerware or cut flowers in vases worth more than most Cadillacs. None of the actors need much emotional range. Most of their time is spent sitting looking at each other about the say things in a monotone. No one shouts or giggles. A baby cries during one of the narrations at his christening and by the time the narration is over, he has already graduated from college with a degree in architecture. The music is lovely. The settings and actors resplendent. But one might as well read Wharton's novel while playing the sound track as to waste time watching this movie.

    The cinematography in this movie is often breathtakingly beautiful. And the performance and pacing often leaden, which kills it. It was as if the whole movie were one long funeral dirge. Which is not at all how the novel reads. It is VERY hard to deal with a novel where most of the action happens in the thoughts of the characters, rather than in dialogue and action. Scorsese did not solve that dilemma here. Yes, Wharton saw most of these characters as having superficial lives, but when they spoke their words, they spoke them naturally. But these actors, most of them, though very fine in other movies, deliver too much of this dialogue - which, I realize, was taken directly from the novel - as if they were not native speakers of English, or at least not native speakers of that English. It is, in short, the problem some actors have with Shakespeare. The great Shakespearean actors manage to deliver their lines with perfect naturalness. Too often, in this movie, the lines came off as very stilted. There were lots of other problems as well. But, in general, it was all too funereal, too leaden. That is not the world Wharton paints. What a shame to have wasted so much talent with so unimpressive results.

    Martin Scorsese's The Age of Innocence is a slightly interesting departure for him, trading in his mean streets and firearms for the 19th century and romantic affairs. Co-adapted by Jay Cocks from the novel by Edith Wharton, the director has been known to say that this is his most violent film, an obvious reference to the emotional violence that takes place as opposed to the more direct, physical confrontations in the majority of his films. It's an interesting idea and that violence is played out by a superb cast topped by Daniel Day-Lewis, Michelle Pfeiffer and Winona Ryder. Day-Lewis takes on the role of Newland Archer, who is recently engaged to Ryder's May Welland but finds himself having difficulty masking his desires for her cousin, Pfeiffer's Ellen Olenska. It's your standard set up for this kind of period piece and it's not told in any way that makes it stand out, but the acting is enough to keep it relatively engaging throughout. Day-Lewis has gotten worlds of acclaim and two Oscar statues for his theatrical, outlandish performances but I've honestly always preferred him in his more subtle, intimate displays and here is another example of him showing what a great actor he can be when he holds things in. The emotions are mostly underneath the surface in this film, and Scorsese was smart enough to cast three actors who were superb at portraying them in the perfect tone, expressing those emotions quietly without overdoing it to the audience or to the other characters on screen. They remain true to their characters and to the time period. Michelle Pfeiffer is the most open character, often questioning the ideals of the time period, and she gets to show the most outward emotion, which she does extremely well. She's a woman torn apart by her desires and what she believes is right, expertly portraying that ongoing internal conflict. Winona Ryder may just be the most impressive of the cast, though, which is something I wasn't expecting to say because at first she felt incredibly miscast in this period setting. Over time she developed her character so well and it's the perfect contrast to Pfeiffer's Olenska. While Olenska is more of an adult an an intellectual equal to Archer, his fianc&eacute;e Welland is naive and childish. She's not necessarily immature, but she succumbs so quickly to what everyone else wants of her and spends much of her life just trying to not upset others. It's a performance that doesn't allow her to do much on the surface, but what Ryder does underneath is wondrous to behold. There's a scene where Welland informs Archer that Olenska is leaving New York to back to Europe, and in his reaction she finally realizes his feelings for her cousin. Ryder doesn't say a word addressing this realization, but through her eyes and the way her face sinks, through the slight change of tone in her voice, she absolutely breaks your heart. Scorsese has always been adept at crafting an atmosphere for his films, but I don't think that particular skill of his shines through here at all. It seems like he's lost in this period setting and as a result it all falls a little flat. The acting keeps it together, but there isn't anything memorable in terms of the tone and it essentially just feels like an Ivory clone at the end of it. There are a few stylistic choices that he takes to set it apart, but these end up being the biggest flaws of the film. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus takes an interesting approach by shooting most of the early scenes from the far side of the room they're set in. He rarely uses close-ups, instead framing the whole room in the shot in order to give the audience a richer look at all of the sets and production design. It provides for a deliberately picturesque atmosphere that I found quite impressive. Although it only works because the actors are competent enough to work in this format, performing almost as if they were on stage. However, they stopped doing this somewhere down the line and things got significantly less interesting as a result. There are still some very beautiful shots used throughout the later stages of the film, but they weren't as unique or interesting as what he had been doing earlier on. I thought the characters trips to the theater were interesting, allowing for a contrast between the large emotions on stage and the restrained ones that our characters portrayed, but they didn't utilize this theme nearly enough. My main problem with the film though, lies in the narration, which is absurdly over-done. The film relies far too much on it, using the voice-over work to spoon feed every drop of background information to the audience. It felt practically as if there was more narrated dialogue than there was delivered by the actual characters on screen. There was a welcome reprieve every time I got to see a character begin to speak, but this only lasted a few minutes before we went right back into the crutch of presenting nice images while the narration rambled on and on endlessly. This over-reliance also forces the film to present any scenes of characters reading letters by shooting the character who wrote the letter and having them read it directly to the audience, staring straight into the camera, a system that is incredibly awkward and distracting. The Age of Innocence was a nice attempt by Scorsese and it was good of him to try to stretch himself out of the niche he had built, but ultimately I don't think he was very successful.

    This 90s period drama is often derided for being dry and slow-moving. Perhaps the real problem though is the misguided attempts to liven it up. Director Martin Scorsese, best known for his snappy crime flicks, seems unable to allow his style to take a step back for a more sedate story. The Age of Innocence is, from start to finish, essentially one long parade of fancy camera-work. The second scene features a lengthy tracking shot, floating gracefully from one character to the next as a voice-over reads an extract from the novel. It's all expertly done, but it's too artificial, shows too much of the mind behind the camera. At other times he is even more overt. What should have been the most poignant moment is spoiled by a series of quick edits to an earlier scene, spelling out the significance and puncturing the emotion. I don't see why Edith Wharton's novel deserves such treatment  it's a good enough story without such gilding. Scorsese was of course set to direct Schindler's List that year, before handing over control to Steven Spielberg. I shudder to think what he might have done to that movie. It's a pity Scorsese chose to be so ostentatious for The Age of Innocence, all the more so because there are a lot of nice things going on here. The art direction is a gorgeous mass of flowers, paintings and assorted fripperies, dominating every set to an extent that is almost surreal. The cast is a treat too. The role of Newland Archer doesn't tease the best out of Daniel Day-Lewis, but he manages it well, with pursed lips conveying his stifled emotions. Michelle Pfeiffer is exceptional in one crucial scene, venting anger without going over-the-top, leading neatly into her first kiss with Day-Lewis. Winona Ryder's performance works really well in a bright innocence totally free of clich&eacute;. It's also wonderful to see piquant British players Miriam Margolyes and Michael Gough. But overall, this picture is just too gimmicky for such things to shine through. The spoken-word extracts from the novel seem not so much to move the plot along but to plug holes in the narrative. Then there is the clunky device of having letters read out, to-camera, by the characters who wrote them. Such cheap tricks divorce the movie from the story's world. This is what makes The Age of Innocence seem dull.
