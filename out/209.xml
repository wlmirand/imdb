  In 1982 legendary British heavy metal band Spinal Tap attempt an American comeback tour accompanied by a fan who is also a film-maker.

    It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that "School of Rock" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately. This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ("I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.") Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is "the entertainment industry" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme. So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

    In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the "rockumentary" film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!

The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!

    It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that "School of Rock" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately. This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ("I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.") Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is "the entertainment industry" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme. So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

    In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the "rockumentary" film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!

    It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that "School of Rock" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately. This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ("I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.") Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is "the entertainment industry" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme. So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

    In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the "rockumentary" film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!

    It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that "School of Rock" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately. This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ("I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.") Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is "the entertainment industry" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme. So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

    In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the "rockumentary" film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!

    It's funny to read the few comments here such as those saying that "School of Rock" was a great film about Rock and Roll. That pretty much sums up the limits of some of the viewers, unfortunately. This film is about a genre in Rock and Roll. If you lived through the 70s, 80s or even the early 90s as a teenager or adult, you can related to the perfect satire of this genre. Many of the jokes are so funny and have some basis in a little bit of what makes people well rounded that they may fly right over the head of younger viewers ("I prize the rent from the local Hebrews.") Without a doubt, if you're a musician you will love this film. If you're not a musician you might not get all the jokes but it is still a hilarious, fun ride. It takes you through everything from the political correctness that is "the entertainment industry" to the image conscious era of 60s/70s rock bands where sexuality reigned supreme. So my guess is that if you're a younger viewer or not at all into the music scene, you may not fully relate. Regardless, this is the movie that started all the mockumentaries and for good reason. The performances are stellar - the actors ARE the band. I enjoyed this film and remember all the lines just because it defined so many great inside jokes of what was. Every cut is hit on this soundtrack.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump".

It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    The funniest thing about this is Rob Reiner's earnestness as a filmmaker trailing hard-rockers Spinal Tap on tour. The band members are so vapid and dim that the idea of their being documented at all is laughable. So when you hear Derek (Harry Shearer) describe his mates as "visionary" it IS sort of funny. Christopher Guest and Michael McKean do OK as the shaggy-haired Nigel and David, and the band generates a few laughs in clips of cleaner-cut incarnations, a la early Beatles. It was semi-entertaining to witness the band's venues gradually deteriorate, to the point of a military hall where clean-cut recruits tend to prefer slow dancing. I didn't find the dialogue overall to be as clever as I expected. The biggest surprise for me was how poorly this "cult classic" has held up.

    What a feast! What a marvelous little parody of a movie. Great work, great casting, great songs, great band members, hilarious moments, excellent dialogs, crazy jokes, real life situations - every little thing here is awesome. I am a rock drummer myself and I loved every second of this great parody. Why, this is a true thing - many bands have fallen victims of similar misadventures - lost backstage, lost with props, lost with song list, lost with band members changes, lost with sound, lost with managers, lost with sense of humor. And the immortal These go to eleven moment is simply The Top. As well as the famous cocoon section with poor bassist trapped inside. Very funny, very wild and riveting. The songs are highly competent, too, and the psychedelic gem Flower People is great in its own right. This is a movie that deserves a high praise and real prize - love of film fans. Must see

    The mockumentary is a rare thing in movies and easy to get wrong. My first experience was with the excruciating "Confetti", a film about as funny as a TV charity appeal. Praise the gods for this, arguably the film that popularised the term and easily the most recognisable example of the niche. You don't need to be a fan of heavy metal to recognise any number of acts in this film - indeed, watching the likes of "Anvil" makes you realise how close to reality this might be. Marty DiBergi (director Rob Reiner) catches up with Britain's loudest rock band Spinal Tap as they launch a comeback tour of the US to promote their latest album "Smell The Glove". The band have had their ups and downs since their initial success in the Sixties but for front-man David St. Hubbins (Michael McKean), lead guitar Nigel Tufnel (Christopher Guest) and bassist Derek Smalls (Harry Shearer), times are tough. The record label are concerned with the excessively sexist overtones with the album cover, their tour is playing to ever-depleting numbers, old tensions resurface between David and Nigel when David's girlfriend Jeanine (June Chadwick) comes over from England and begins to exert her astrology-influenced control over the group's direction - all of which tests the patience of their long-suffering manager Ian Faith (Tony Hendra). DiBergi's documentary covers all of these issues as well as interviews with the band members backstage. The beauty of "This Is Spinal Tap" is that so much of it is believable from Nigel's insane guitar solos to the ludicrous stage props and back to David's ridiculous philosophising of songs like "Lick My Love Pump". As a satire, it is absolutely spot-on and as a comedy, it also works brilliantly well - I can think of few films with so much quotable dialogue, even if some of it is spoken over. And this, ultimately, is part of the film's problem. What it has in plausibility, it lacks in cohesion - many scenes feature multiple characters talking at the same time which I found somewhat confusing and made following the film awkward. For me, the best moments were when DiBergi was one-on-one with the band members which were not just brilliantly performed but spoke volumes about a band refusing to acknowledge that their best days were behind them and simply had no idea about the real world beyond their smoky, ill-lit world on stage. Whilst not exactly difficult, "This Is Spinal Tap" did an excellent job of demonstrating what was wrong with "Confetti". It was funnier, sharper, more realistic and utterly convincing - at times, I had to keep reminding myself that they aren't a real band. Credit has to go to the performers who somehow kept a straight face while discussing amps going to 11 and performing with midgets dancing around a miniature Stonehenge. It can't have been easy but the results are plain to see - this remains a fine parody of not just rock bands but music documentaries in general. Forget pretenders to the throne like "Walk Hard: The Dewey Cox Story" - this is still top of the charts for me. It may be an easy target but once seen, I don't think I'll ever be able to take heavy metal seriously ever again.

    Comedic actors Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer show off their fantastic ability to improvise in this dead on parody of rock documentaries. Rob Reiner, making his feature film directing debut, and who co-wrote the script with the stars, plays a documentary filmmaker who decides to chronicle the latest tour of a veteran rock group that has clearly seen much better days. The movie features a very high amount of gags that actually work, and one can believe that, yeah, crazy stuff like this could very well happen in the world of rock 'n' roll. Among the best are the conceptual drawings of the band ("This is what you'd look like as a crab."), the recreation of a piece of Stonehenge that is nowhere near as large as the band wanted, the amplifier that goes to 11, Nigels' description of a heart warming piece he's composed, and a truly gut busting sequence wherein the cover art for the bands' latest album is discussed. The three main actors are all wonderful and show a real talent for, and knowledge of, music as well as comedy, which really helps to create a level of believability. Some of their dialogue is truly hilarious. There's a lot of familiar faces in the supporting cast; the cameos are a delight. As a bonus, the music is really pretty good, and are accompanied by some of the silliest / most brilliant lyrics you'll ever hear. At 83 minutes in length, this doesn't go on any longer than it has to, and it maintains a superb forward momentum the entire time, coming up with one great laugh after another and remaining fresh and unpredictable. Highly recommended. Eight out of 11.

    There is still no film like it and the way things are going I doubt if there ever will be! it is truly a phenomenal and phenomenally funny piece of cinematic history! If you don't sit and laugh then you have no sense of humour! there are so many funny bits in it it would all take too long to put them down here so here are just three of the very many: The band think they are just that bit better than everyone else out there in the world of music and therefore be just that bit louder so they have an amplifier that goes up to 11! or when one of the band draws something to scale on a paper napkin/serviette only for the stage set designers think it has been drawn full size so that is what ends up on stage at the front of the stage! Or when the four of them come up through the stage in plastic tubes only for one to not open at the start of the song or during any part of it and ends up needing to be rescued by stage hands! This is a must have film!

    Marty De Bergi is a documentary maker who accompanies Spinal Tap, a rock n roll band on one of their tours which is full of unexpected events. This is a terrific "mockumentary" about a band which is loosing its popularity quite rapidly. The acting is as realistic as it can get. Rob Reiner gets the casting spot on. He himself is brilliant as the documentary maker who gets on screen only when he is asking questions but the look of incredulity on his face is priceless. There are many laugh out loud moments in the movie. For me, the airport sequence easily took the cake. The songs are sometime juvenile but still catchy and memorable. The movie looks a bit dated but still is very funny. 3.5 out of 5 for this cult comedy.

    In This Is Spinal Tap, Rob Reiner, Christopher Guest, Michael McKean, and Harry Shearer not only created one of the funniest films of all time, but they also assembled a fictional rock band with a believable back story spanning several decades and a collection of rock songs covering the full spectrum of heavy metal topics (sex, religion, mythology, self-aggrandizement) and styles (glam rock, arena rock, folk rock, hard rock) with such fidelity to the musical genre of the period, that if you ignored the tongue-in-cheek lyrics, you wouldn't know they were parodies. This Is Spinal Tap is spoof as well as satire; it mocks the "rockumentary" film which almost always takes its subject way more seriously than its import warrants, and it pokes loving fun at rock music, the rockers who spend their creative talents making it, and the fans who love it. The non-stop humor originates equally from scripted scenes and apparently ad-libbed bits, from situation and characterization, from dialogue and sight gags, and from back-stage shenanigans and musical performances. But perhaps the largest part of the ensuing hilarity stems from the various tactics that the aging band employs to overcome its main obstacle (its waning popularity). The fall from the top is long and demeaning, especially for a band as great as Spinal Tap. And while some men find Greatness, and others have Greatness thrust upon them, these guys grab Greatness by the armadillo in its trousers, and bash its head against an 18-inch replica of Stonehenge. "Do a good show, alright?"

    I vote this film highly, I have caught bits and pieces over the years on TV but had never had the chance to actually watch it. And I grew up in the 80's. I thought most of my younger years that Spinal Tap was a real band. I was only about 7 years old when this came out, so please forgive me. I sat down to watch this, and realized, no they are not real, and yes it is very funny how Rob Reiner takes previous films like Led Zepplin's "The Song Remains the Same" documentary film, and turns it on it's head. Especially when the lead singer in this film tries to do the Jimmy Page and instead of a violin bow on a guitar he actually takes a whole violin and uses it to play the guitar. This was hilarious, or when they try to sing popular tunes from other bands they always forget the words. I could go on and on. This film captures most of all the rock documentaries that I have seen from Zepplin to the Rolling Stones documentaries, it's so interesting how Reiner captures that by the film grade and just the acting in general. This film is actually looks and feels like Depeche Mode 101 directed by D.A Pennebaker. But that film wasn't made until a few years after. But it's funny how close it is to this film, kinda creepy. I'd say "This is Spinal Tap" is a very funny film in an indirect British humour kind of way. The humour is very subtle, and sometimes have to think about it. It's one of those films where you have to watch it multiple times and see something different every time. I love how the film goes from the band being very popular to playing concerts to a smaller and smaller audience, this is another subtle thing I noticed. Great film, I loved it too bad it took 35 years to get around to it. The only problem I have is that is was too short.

    The spoof "This is Spinal Tap" displays the true reality of a rock n' roll life style. As a filmmaker follows the fictional band Spinal Tap through out the film you see every component that goes into becoming and maintaining a rock n' roll image. Michael McKean (David St. Hubbins), Christopher Guest (Nigel Tufnel) and Harry Shearer (Derek Smalls) do a great job portraying the British rock band that is Spinal Tap. Rob Reiner's is the filmmaker following Spinal Tap during their disastrous comeback tour to the United States, which proves some things are best left in the past. The film goes through the events as if you are truly watching a documentary. The band members are serious as they debate over album covers and band member's girlfriends. The way Reiner uses lighting during the concerts to emphasis the bulges in the bands pants will have you on the floor laughing. The dialog alone will have you repeating this movie again and again. Nigel's complete lack of common sense keeps you laughing from beginning to end. The scene where Nigel is trying to figure out how to fit the lunchmeat on "tiny" bread is hilarious and as they explain why their amplifier goes up to eleven you have to wonder to yourself if this is truly the conversation that happen backstage before a show. This film is comedy at its finest it doesn't make you look for an alternative meaning or depth it is just good old comedy similar to Wayne's World. If you loved the 80's with this its big hair, tight jeans, and power ballads that examine the female body "This is Spinal Tap" is the movie for you. Turn your TV up to 11 and enjoy!
