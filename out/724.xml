    I was surprised to see that this has only 6.5 average grading from IMDb users! This is a great film in any way possible. Acting, portrayal of characters, music and of course the story are all well beyond average. You will also appreciate that none of the characters is 2-dimentional, not even the "bad ones", like Sean and Nan. You can see behind the reasons of their actions, even if you don't agree with them. I remember renting this back in 1996, not expecting much from it. Then, I was was taken by the whole film, especially by "that chubby unknown but brilliant young actress". In that manner I was more than pleased when some years later I saw Minnie Driver becoming very well-known and being Oscar nominated for her role in "Good Will Hunting". Knowing now that she gained all those pounds just for the role of Benny, males me thing that deserved an Oscar nod and for this film! i particularly liked and Chris o Donnel for this and also for the message it gives about one being him or herself, instead of trying to be something else in order to gain someone's-anyone's approval or love! It was years after that that I also noticed that this was an adaptation of a book of Maeve Binchy one of my favorite authors. When I had the chance to watch this again, then I noticed and Colin Firth playing also. Another reason for anyone to watch it!!!

    As a general rule, I am picky about adaptations of books on the big screen, but there is much to love about this version of Maeve Binchy's excellent novel. I loved the book from the first time I read it, and was delighted to find a film version to rent. The cast are really very good and the movie is well-written and directed. Minnie Driver is wonderful as Benny, with Chris O'Donnell portraying a slightly more sympathetic Jack than the selfish young man in the novel, and excellent support from Geraldine O'Rawe, Saffron Burrows, Alan Cumming and Colin Firth (getting to play a cad rather than the hero for a change). There are, of course, some major differences from the novel but nonetheless the film works, in and of itself, and it is still extremely enjoyable. I can accept that for a Hollywood movie, a more conclusive ending was required than that provided by Binchy in the book, and it was made believable by the chemistry between Driver and O'Donnell in the last few scenes. I would agree that the sexual life of savages would be an unlikely subject for first year students in 1950s Ireland, but I like Ciaran Hinds as the lecturer, so I'll let it go...I also would have liked to see more of Binchy's supporting cast make it into the movie - Mother Francis, for example, who brought up Eve, or some of the other friends outside of the college group such as Clodagh or Fonzie. Obviously a film has limitations that do not hinder an author, but I would also have liked there to have been more back story for Nan - just why she chooses Simon, for example. And I could always use more interaction between Eve and Aidan, whose scenes in the book are richly comic and translate very well onto the screen. Despite my quibbles, I have always liked this film, and I would recommend it to most people, whether they have read the book or not, for its entertainment value.

    As much as I like Colin Firth ever since his portrayal in the A&E production of "Pride and Prejudice," "What a Girl Wants," and "Master of the Moor," I have to say that this movie was totally monotonous, dreary and tedious. A dull and boring and uninspired movie about girls in 1950's Ireland trying to find their womanhood through their drawers and the drawers of the men they are involved in. I had seen this movie before my interest in Firth's career and found the characters implausible and improbable. All the characters were unbelievable except perhaps the "Uriah Heep" of the movie played by Aidan Gillen which oiled up the screen really good and made you cringe with revulsion with his attack. No real conclusions of the movie except that Bernadette 'Benny' Hogan (Minnie Driver) decided to give sex a try. A real inspiring yawn . . .

    I was glad to see Chris O'Donnell in this movie. He did this to show the Irish side of him. As an Irishwoman, I loved that. O'Donnell shines as Jack Foley, the good-looking Rugby star who falls in love with Benny (Driver). O'Donnell plays Foley with suavity, sympathy & class. You like him; even when you find out about Nan. He just has a way of making you swoon. And I loved the accent. My favorite scene in this movie is Jack in a tuxedo. Talk about hot! Chris O'Donnell has always been good-looking, but wearing that tuxedo & speaking with an Irish accent made me swoon. Driver gives a star-is-born performance as Benny, the 'ordinary' girl who dreams of more than Knockglen. You feel her pain as she deals her whole life with not being the beauty Nan is; & cheer when Jack tells her he loves her. I discovered what a talent Alan Cumming is. His portrayal of Sean Walsh gave me the creeps; yet I kept hoping for more screen time. Geraldine O'Rawe is another breakthrough performance as Eve. She is a loyal friend to Benny & a joy to watch on screen. Her beauty & grace are unmatched in this film. A very sweet movie & a good addition to anyone's collection. If you are Irish, rent & enjoy this gem. If you are not, rent anyways. It just proves that sometimes the person you want may not be out of reach. Sometimes dreams do come true.

    This was a great movie, but it was a little different than the book. Spoilers: Nan was friends with Benny and Eve since childhood in the movie. In the book, they met at college. I liked O'Donald's character better in the movie than in the book. In the book, he acted like a jerk to Benny when she was too busy taking care of her widowed mother. In the movie, though he did feel a little lonely and got a little impatient,he (up until he cheated on her) was a little more understanding. In the book, I thought they implied that Benny got together with her, but I think she left it up to the author to decide. Other users says they did not get back together. In the movie, they definitely did get back together. I liked the part where Benny hit the bag over that creep's head and the money spilled out! Nan and Eve were great for their part. Although I do not consider O'Donald gorgeous, he is talented. I read some users comments. I also noticed the flaw they made when they said they were making their confirmation, (as other users stated) which was really the communion. However, that was not important to me. A lot of users were critical about the movie being so centered around sex. I agree with them, that it did get too much after a while, but those are real problems that teens and young adults faced then, and now. But back then they did not have sex education. (just guilt, from the catholic church)Perhaps if people talked to them about the real consequences of having sex (rather that preaching about it being a mortal sin)they would not have so much of a desire to have it. I think if this were a real story, Benny would have made a big mistake by having sex(obviously unprotected) and it would be a shame for a talented smart writer like Benny to ruin her chance of having a career; however, the movie ended there. I do not think it was made to teach you that you should have premarital sex, (though realistically it happened, even then, though it was just not talked of) It was made to entertain. It was a romantic love story, not a life lesson. A lot of people were disappointed by the fact that Benny gave Jack and second chance, but at least in the movie, he was not a jerk like he was in the book, as I said. Somebody said that the parents looked old for parents back then, but it was not unusual for women to take years to get pregnet, or to have many miscarriages (sadly). Back then they did not have the prenatal care that they have now, or ways of getting pregnet. The fact that she had only one child was also unusual for that time, which also implies that the mother probably took a long time to conceive. So I thought using older parents was appropriate, and backed up justly. Overall, a great movie!

    This review contains SPOILERS, I'm trying to save you from seeing this movie. I started watching this movie thinking I was going to like it. It looked like a coming of age tale, the 1950's Irish setting seemed appealing, the characters seemed interesting. The main character is a large, unattractive girl, Bennie, from a small town, and the story centers around her and her two friends, Eve and Nan. Eve was a simple girl with a moralistic bent, raised in a convent, while Nan grew up a sophisticated, big city girl in Dublin. The story really gets going while the three are at university. For a while it seemed like a sweet coming of age tale of some sort, but I should have been suspicious when all the excerpts of college lectures dealt with the sexual practices of savages, and with all the talk about sex, between the girls and between Bennie and her new boyfriend, a jock on campus and a pre-med major. The movie goes along pretty innocently for quite a while. The girls were in school, and it looked like the girls were striving to expand their horizons, improve their situation. They go to a dance and are caught up with boyfriends. Then a lot of the action is compressed in the last half hour of the movie, turning the whole thing into a big, sappy soap opera. Nan services some guy, get rejected by the buffoon when they discover she's pregnant, then seduces Bennie's boyfriend in an attempt to trick HIM into marrying her. Eve finds out, approaches Nan with a bread knife, causing Nan to fall, get cut, and lose the baby. The boyfriend then returns to Bennie and she takes him back, and the movie ends as these two are finally about to go all the way. As it ends, you don't feel uplifted, Bennie hasn't learned anything or grown, she remains a big, unattractive girl, now with a boyfriend that knows he graze in greener pastures once in a while and she'll take him back.

    This rating reflects my ambivalent feelings about the movie... I seem to recall the novel (which I read some years ago) as having a little more depth than the sexual experiences (or lack thereof) of its three heroines. The film comes off as a bit of a soap opera, 1950's Irish style. Although I'm not Catholic myself, my main problem with the movie (and Maeve Binchy's novels, to some extent) is the constant irritating depiction of the Catholic church as an oppressive institution that exists more or less for the primary purpose of sexually repressing its adherents. Also, the producers should have done some very basic research into Catholic traditions. As another reviewer also noted, it is extremely obvious (and not only to Catholics) that the opening religious ceremony in the film is not the three girls' Confirmation at all but their First Communion. The movie thus lost credibility to me from the outset. The movie tells the story of three Irish friends who are embarking upon their college days...Benny, a rather biggish (supposedly) self conscious girl, Eve, a quiet orphan raised by nuns, and Nan, a lovely would be sophisticate who sets her cap for the young Protestant country squire, Simon. For business purposes, Benny's father is encouraging his shop employee, Sean, to court his daughter. However, Benny has fallen in love with a handsome college classmate and rugby star named Jack. Meanwhile, Nan and Simon are conducting a clandestine affair in Eve's cottage. After Nan discovers that she is pregnant, Simon indicates that he has no intention of marrying a girl of her social / financial status and suggests an abortion. To get out of her pickle, Nan then proceeds to seduce Jack and attempt to pass her baby off as his child. Read the above... doesn't it all sound like a soap? Who's sleeping with who? Anyway, carrying on... Minnie Driver gives a marvelous, sympathetic portrayal of Benny, a young girl insecure over her appearance, caught up in her first love and awakening desires, pursued by an unwelcome suitor, trapped with familial obligations following her father's sudden death, and ultimately betrayed by her boyfriend and one of her best friends. She's beautiful at the dance when she first reveals her vulnerability to Jack. I agree with those who claim that Benny is not sufficiently large for the role, not 'big as a rhinoceros' at all...attractive figure, just pudgy face...but that's a minor detail. Chris O'Donnell is perfect as her dashing young love, convincing in his devastated reaction to the news of Nan's pregnancy and choosing to unhappily but nobly do the right thing, marry the girl. He's much more sympathetic in the movie, where he has only a one night moment of madness with Nan, than in the novel, where it's more of an affair. Eve seems well cast, but Sean's pilfering, lecherous, peeping tom character is definitely overdone, almost a caricature, as others have also noted. Nan's character is well captured here, as the viewer (this one, at least) has sympathy for her genuine sense of giving herself to Sean when she loses her virginity, her betrayal by him when he hears of her pregnancy, and even to some extent her dastardly deed to both Jack and Benny for her own selfish interests. One point well brought out is that while Nan believes herself to have contempt for Catholicism, when it comes to abortion, we see that she has internalized at least some of the teachings of her faith. Of course the Irish music is fantastic and the country scenery beautiful, the green hills, streams, and meandering roads. I was less impressed that the professor's lecture topics just happened to involve the sexual practices of savages. I certainly don't recall that from the novel, though it's been awhile. What is the likelihood that this would have been the class subject matter for a coed freshman class in Ireland back in the 1950's? The film has a different ending than the novel, which will disappoint some readers. Normally this would infuriate me, but I found surprisingly that I didn't mind. In the book, Benny forgives Jack and remains friends with him, but, having gained confidence and a sense of independence, moves on with her life. Here of course we see a less complex storybook type ending with the couple getting together. Pity she has sex with him at the end...of course with a parting dig at the Catholic Church ('Bless me, Father, for I have sinned'). At least it's apparently at Benny's own instigation, not in response to pressure from Jack. The movie is really mainly sex...either wanting it, talking about it, or having it. Not much else to the story. So...yes, a mixed review. Not the best morals and a certain mocking of Catholic teachings (or Christian teachings, in general), but kind of a touching story of first love, a sympathetic heroine, and that lovely Irish scenery.

    This was the first film of Minnie Driver I ever saw and I loved her in this role as the main character Benny (or Ben as her friends call her) whose coming of age story is told within the full circle of the film as is that of her friends. If you see Driver in this, she is a far cry from the glamour puss she has become today in Hollywood films, but her acting is still just as superb. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone with a taste or stamina for bawdy Irish jokes, rawness one only sees from the other-side of the pond from time to time and heartbreak that exists in the lives of everyone especially those just getting to know the world for what it truly is. Chris O' Donnell also appears in the film, as the charming young lad Benny falls in love with. Alan Cumming (in another stereotypically sinister role), Colin Firth and Saffron Burrows also co-star.

    Spoilers in this review, please do not read if you don't want the movie ruined. I read the book and to be honest, was very bored with it from the start, but once I start a book, I always finish. Well, about a day after I finished the book, I found the movie online and decided to buy it and figured maybe it would be better. I was so very wrong. Minnie Driver isn't even close to being "a barrel of a girl" or an "elephant" as she was called in the book many many times. You could even see her bones popping out of her skin through most of the movie. The whole point of the book and the story is that you don't have to be a beauty or thin or perfect. Benny seemed to be the same size as the other girls with a little chubbier face. They also completely changed the ending, she turns Jack down flat and moves on with her life (in the book) instead of pining away over the man who broke her heart and ending up back with him.(in the movie) I have many more complaints about the differences but I will spare you. Both the movie and the book are pretty much boring, I wouldn't waste your time with either of them.

    I just watched this movie with my teen-aged daughter. We both enjoyed it, and it brought an opportunity to think and talk about teen-aged sexual matters, especially "first-time" sex. However, we did find an error in this Irish-Catholic movie, and that was in the opening scene where the three girls were receiving "Confirmation." In fact, they were receiving their First Holy Communion. This error was shocking! We expected to find it listed as a "goof" in the IMDb listing, but no goofs were given. Another thing we thought very strange was that Benny's parents looked so very old--old enough to be her grandparents. Considering the time line of the movie, most first-time parents in the '50s would have been young (20-ish, not 40-ish) when their first child was born. Maybe in the book it tells that the parents were older first-time parents. Overall, a very enjoyable film.

The fact that she had only one child was also unusual for that time, which also implies that the mother probably took a long time to conceive. So I thought using older parents was appropriate, and backed up justly. Overall, a great movie!

    This review contains SPOILERS, I'm trying to save you from seeing this movie. I started watching this movie thinking I was going to like it. It looked like a coming of age tale, the 1950's Irish setting seemed appealing, the characters seemed interesting. The main character is a large, unattractive girl, Bennie, from a small town, and the story centers around her and her two friends, Eve and Nan. Eve was a simple girl with a moralistic bent, raised in a convent, while Nan grew up a sophisticated, big city girl in Dublin. The story really gets going while the three are at university. For a while it seemed like a sweet coming of age tale of some sort, but I should have been suspicious when all the excerpts of college lectures dealt with the sexual practices of savages, and with all the talk about sex, between the girls and between Bennie and her new boyfriend, a jock on campus and a pre-med major. The movie goes along pretty innocently for quite a while. The girls were in school, and it looked like the girls were striving to expand their horizons, improve their situation. They go to a dance and are caught up with boyfriends. Then a lot of the action is compressed in the last half hour of the movie, turning the whole thing into a big, sappy soap opera. Nan services some guy, get rejected by the buffoon when they discover she's pregnant, then seduces Bennie's boyfriend in an attempt to trick HIM into marrying her. Eve finds out, approaches Nan with a bread knife, causing Nan to fall, get cut, and lose the baby. The boyfriend then returns to Bennie and she takes him back, and the movie ends as these two are finally about to go all the way. As it ends, you don't feel uplifted, Bennie hasn't learned anything or grown, she remains a big, unattractive girl, now with a boyfriend that knows he graze in greener pastures once in a while and she'll take him back.

    This rating reflects my ambivalent feelings about the movie... I seem to recall the novel (which I read some years ago) as having a little more depth than the sexual experiences (or lack thereof) of its three heroines. The film comes off as a bit of a soap opera, 1950's Irish style. Although I'm not Catholic myself, my main problem with the movie (and Maeve Binchy's novels, to some extent) is the constant irritating depiction of the Catholic church as an oppressive institution that exists more or less for the primary purpose of sexually repressing its adherents. Also, the producers should have done some very basic research into Catholic traditions. As another reviewer also noted, it is extremely obvious (and not only to Catholics) that the opening religious ceremony in the film is not the three girls' Confirmation at all but their First Communion. The movie thus lost credibility to me from the outset. The movie tells the story of three Irish friends who are embarking upon their college days...Benny, a rather biggish (supposedly) self conscious girl, Eve, a quiet orphan raised by nuns, and Nan, a lovely would be sophisticate who sets her cap for the young Protestant country squire, Simon. For business purposes, Benny's father is encouraging his shop employee, Sean, to court his daughter. However, Benny has fallen in love with a handsome college classmate and rugby star named Jack. Meanwhile, Nan and Simon are conducting a clandestine affair in Eve's cottage. After Nan discovers that she is pregnant, Simon indicates that he has no intention of marrying a girl of her social / financial status and suggests an abortion. To get out of her pickle, Nan then proceeds to seduce Jack and attempt to pass her baby off as his child. Read the above... doesn't it all sound like a soap? Who's sleeping with who? Anyway, carrying on... Minnie Driver gives a marvelous, sympathetic portrayal of Benny, a young girl insecure over her appearance, caught up in her first love and awakening desires, pursued by an unwelcome suitor, trapped with familial obligations following her father's sudden death, and ultimately betrayed by her boyfriend and one of her best friends. She's beautiful at the dance when she first reveals her vulnerability to Jack. I agree with those who claim that Benny is not sufficiently large for the role, not 'big as a rhinoceros' at all...attractive figure, just pudgy face...but that's a minor detail. Chris O'Donnell is perfect as her dashing young love, convincing in his devastated reaction to the news of Nan's pregnancy and choosing to unhappily but nobly do the right thing, marry the girl. He's much more sympathetic in the movie, where he has only a one night moment of madness with Nan, than in the novel, where it's more of an affair. Eve seems well cast, but Sean's pilfering, lecherous, peeping tom character is definitely overdone, almost a caricature, as others have also noted. Nan's character is well captured here, as the viewer (this one, at least) has sympathy for her genuine sense of giving herself to Sean when she loses her virginity, her betrayal by him when he hears of her pregnancy, and even to some extent her dastardly deed to both Jack and Benny for her own selfish interests. One point well brought out is that while Nan believes herself to have contempt for Catholicism, when it comes to abortion, we see that she has internalized at least some of the teachings of her faith. Of course the Irish music is fantastic and the country scenery beautiful, the green hills, streams, and meandering roads. I was less impressed that the professor's lecture topics just happened to involve the sexual practices of savages. I certainly don't recall that from the novel, though it's been awhile. What is the likelihood that this would have been the class subject matter for a coed freshman class in Ireland back in the 1950's? The film has a different ending than the novel, which will disappoint some readers. Normally this would infuriate me, but I found surprisingly that I didn't mind. In the book, Benny forgives Jack and remains friends with him, but, having gained confidence and a sense of independence, moves on with her life. Here of course we see a less complex storybook type ending with the couple getting together. Pity she has sex with him at the end...of course with a parting dig at the Catholic Church ('Bless me, Father, for I have sinned'). At least it's apparently at Benny's own instigation, not in response to pressure from Jack. The movie is really mainly sex...either wanting it, talking about it, or having it. Not much else to the story. So...yes, a mixed review. Not the best morals and a certain mocking of Catholic teachings (or Christian teachings, in general), but kind of a touching story of first love, a sympathetic heroine, and that lovely Irish scenery.

    This was the first film of Minnie Driver I ever saw and I loved her in this role as the main character Benny (or Ben as her friends call her) whose coming of age story is told within the full circle of the film as is that of her friends. If you see Driver in this, she is a far cry from the glamour puss she has become today in Hollywood films, but her acting is still just as superb. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone with a taste or stamina for bawdy Irish jokes, rawness one only sees from the other-side of the pond from time to time and heartbreak that exists in the lives of everyone especially those just getting to know the world for what it truly is. Chris O' Donnell also appears in the film, as the charming young lad Benny falls in love with. Alan Cumming (in another stereotypically sinister role), Colin Firth and Saffron Burrows also co-star.

    Spoilers in this review, please do not read if you don't want the movie ruined. I read the book and to be honest, was very bored with it from the start, but once I start a book, I always finish. Well, about a day after I finished the book, I found the movie online and decided to buy it and figured maybe it would be better. I was so very wrong. Minnie Driver isn't even close to being "a barrel of a girl" or an "elephant" as she was called in the book many many times. You could even see her bones popping out of her skin through most of the movie. The whole point of the book and the story is that you don't have to be a beauty or thin or perfect. Benny seemed to be the same size as the other girls with a little chubbier face. They also completely changed the ending, she turns Jack down flat and moves on with her life (in the book) instead of pining away over the man who broke her heart and ending up back with him.(in the movie) I have many more complaints about the differences but I will spare you. Both the movie and the book are pretty much boring, I wouldn't waste your time with either of them.

    I just watched this movie with my teen-aged daughter. We both enjoyed it, and it brought an opportunity to think and talk about teen-aged sexual matters, especially "first-time" sex. However, we did find an error in this Irish-Catholic movie, and that was in the opening scene where the three girls were receiving "Confirmation." In fact, they were receiving their First Holy Communion. This error was shocking! We expected to find it listed as a "goof" in the IMDb listing, but no goofs were given. Another thing we thought very strange was that Benny's parents looked so very old--old enough to be her grandparents. Considering the time line of the movie, most first-time parents in the '50s would have been young (20-ish, not 40-ish) when their first child was born. Maybe in the book it tells that the parents were older first-time parents. Overall, a very enjoyable film.

    I was surprised to see that this has only 6.5 average grading from IMDb users! This is a great film in any way possible. Acting, portrayal of characters, music and of course the story are all well beyond average. You will also appreciate that none of the characters is 2-dimentional, not even the "bad ones", like Sean and Nan. You can see behind the reasons of their actions, even if you don't agree with them. I remember renting this back in 1996, not expecting much from it. Then, I was was taken by the whole film, especially by "that chubby unknown but brilliant young actress". In that manner I was more than pleased when some years later I saw Minnie Driver becoming very well-known and being Oscar nominated for her role in "Good Will Hunting". Knowing now that she gained all those pounds just for the role of Benny, males me thing that deserved an Oscar nod and for this film! i particularly liked and Chris o Donnel for this and also for the message it gives about one being him or herself, instead of trying to be something else in order to gain someone's-anyone's approval or love! It was years after that that I also noticed that this was an adaptation of a book of Maeve Binchy one of my favorite authors. When I had the chance to watch this again, then I noticed and Colin Firth playing also. Another reason for anyone to watch it!!!

    As a general rule, I am picky about adaptations of books on the big screen, but there is much to love about this version of Maeve Binchy's excellent novel. I loved the book from the first time I read it, and was delighted to find a film version to rent. The cast are really very good and the movie is well-written and directed. Minnie Driver is wonderful as Benny, with Chris O'Donnell portraying a slightly more sympathetic Jack than the selfish young man in the novel, and excellent support from Geraldine O'Rawe, Saffron Burrows, Alan Cumming and Colin Firth (getting to play a cad rather than the hero for a change). There are, of course, some major differences from the novel but nonetheless the film works, in and of itself, and it is still extremely enjoyable. I can accept that for a Hollywood movie, a more conclusive ending was required than that provided by Binchy in the book, and it was made believable by the chemistry between Driver and O'Donnell in the last few scenes. I would agree that the sexual life of savages would be an unlikely subject for first year students in 1950s Ireland, but I like Ciaran Hinds as the lecturer, so I'll let it go...I also would have liked to see more of Binchy's supporting cast make it into the movie - Mother Francis, for example, who brought up Eve, or some of the other friends outside of the college group such as Clodagh or Fonzie. Obviously a film has limitations that do not hinder an author, but I would also have liked there to have been more back story for Nan - just why she chooses Simon, for example. And I could always use more interaction between Eve and Aidan, whose scenes in the book are richly comic and translate very well onto the screen. Despite my quibbles, I have always liked this film, and I would recommend it to most people, whether they have read the book or not, for its entertainment value.

    As much as I like Colin Firth ever since his portrayal in the A&E production of "Pride and Prejudice," "What a Girl Wants," and "Master of the Moor," I have to say that this movie was totally monotonous, dreary and tedious. A dull and boring and uninspired movie about girls in 1950's Ireland trying to find their womanhood through their drawers and the drawers of the men they are involved in. I had seen this movie before my interest in Firth's career and found the characters implausible and improbable. All the characters were unbelievable except perhaps the "Uriah Heep" of the movie played by Aidan Gillen which oiled up the screen really good and made you cringe with revulsion with his attack. No real conclusions of the movie except that Bernadette 'Benny' Hogan (Minnie Driver) decided to give sex a try. A real inspiring yawn . . .

    I was glad to see Chris O'Donnell in this movie. He did this to show the Irish side of him. As an Irishwoman, I loved that. O'Donnell shines as Jack Foley, the good-looking Rugby star who falls in love with Benny (Driver). O'Donnell plays Foley with suavity, sympathy & class. You like him; even when you find out about Nan. He just has a way of making you swoon. And I loved the accent. My favorite scene in this movie is Jack in a tuxedo. Talk about hot! Chris O'Donnell has always been good-looking, but wearing that tuxedo & speaking with an Irish accent made me swoon. Driver gives a star-is-born performance as Benny, the 'ordinary' girl who dreams of more than Knockglen. You feel her pain as she deals her whole life with not being the beauty Nan is; & cheer when Jack tells her he loves her. I discovered what a talent Alan Cumming is. His portrayal of Sean Walsh gave me the creeps; yet I kept hoping for more screen time. Geraldine O'Rawe is another breakthrough performance as Eve. She is a loyal friend to Benny & a joy to watch on screen. Her beauty & grace are unmatched in this film. A very sweet movie & a good addition to anyone's collection. If you are Irish, rent & enjoy this gem. If you are not, rent anyways. It just proves that sometimes the person you want may not be out of reach. Sometimes dreams do come true.

    This was a great movie, but it was a little different than the book. Spoilers: Nan was friends with Benny and Eve since childhood in the movie. In the book, they met at college. I liked O'Donald's character better in the movie than in the book. In the book, he acted like a jerk to Benny when she was too busy taking care of her widowed mother. In the movie, though he did feel a little lonely and got a little impatient,he (up until he cheated on her) was a little more understanding. In the book, I thought they implied that Benny got together with her, but I think she left it up to the author to decide. Other users says they did not get back together. In the movie, they definitely did get back together. I liked the part where Benny hit the bag over that creep's head and the money spilled out! Nan and Eve were great for their part. Although I do not consider O'Donald gorgeous, he is talented. I read some users comments. I also noticed the flaw they made when they said they were making their confirmation, (as other users stated) which was really the communion. However, that was not important to me. A lot of users were critical about the movie being so centered around sex. I agree with them, that it did get too much after a while, but those are real problems that teens and young adults faced then, and now. But back then they did not have sex education. (just guilt, from the catholic church)Perhaps if people talked to them about the real consequences of having sex (rather that preaching about it being a mortal sin)they would not have so much of a desire to have it. I think if this were a real story, Benny would have made a big mistake by having sex(obviously unprotected) and it would be a shame for a talented smart writer like Benny to ruin her chance of having a career; however, the movie ended there. I do not think it was made to teach you that you should have premarital sex, (though realistically it happened, even then, though it was just not talked of) It was made to entertain. It was a romantic love story, not a life lesson. A lot of people were disappointed by the fact that Benny gave Jack and second chance, but at least in the movie, he was not a jerk like he was in the book, as I said. Somebody said that the parents looked old for parents back then, but it was not unusual for women to take years to get pregnet, or to have many miscarriages (sadly). Back then they did not have the prenatal care that they have now, or ways of getting pregnet. The fact that she had only one child was also unusual for that time, which also implies that the mother probably took a long time to conceive. So I thought using older parents was appropriate, and backed up justly. Overall, a great movie!

    I was surprised to see that this has only 6.5 average grading from IMDb users! This is a great film in any way possible. Acting, portrayal of characters, music and of course the story are all well beyond average. You will also appreciate that none of the characters is 2-dimentional, not even the "bad ones", like Sean and Nan. You can see behind the reasons of their actions, even if you don't agree with them. I remember renting this back in 1996, not expecting much from it. Then, I was was taken by the whole film, especially by "that chubby unknown but brilliant young actress". In that manner I was more than pleased when some years later I saw Minnie Driver becoming very well-known and being Oscar nominated for her role in "Good Will Hunting". Knowing now that she gained all those pounds just for the role of Benny, males me thing that deserved an Oscar nod and for this film! i particularly liked and Chris o Donnel for this and also for the message it gives about one being him or herself, instead of trying to be something else in order to gain someone's-anyone's approval or love! It was years after that that I also noticed that this was an adaptation of a book of Maeve Binchy one of my favorite authors. When I had the chance to watch this again, then I noticed and Colin Firth playing also. Another reason for anyone to watch it!!!

    As a general rule, I am picky about adaptations of books on the big screen, but there is much to love about this version of Maeve Binchy's excellent novel. I loved the book from the first time I read it, and was delighted to find a film version to rent. The cast are really very good and the movie is well-written and directed. Minnie Driver is wonderful as Benny, with Chris O'Donnell portraying a slightly more sympathetic Jack than the selfish young man in the novel, and excellent support from Geraldine O'Rawe, Saffron Burrows, Alan Cumming and Colin Firth (getting to play a cad rather than the hero for a change). There are, of course, some major differences from the novel but nonetheless the film works, in and of itself, and it is still extremely enjoyable. I can accept that for a Hollywood movie, a more conclusive ending was required than that provided by Binchy in the book, and it was made believable by the chemistry between Driver and O'Donnell in the last few scenes. I would agree that the sexual life of savages would be an unlikely subject for first year students in 1950s Ireland, but I like Ciaran Hinds as the lecturer, so I'll let it go...I also would have liked to see more of Binchy's supporting cast make it into the movie - Mother Francis, for example, who brought up Eve, or some of the other friends outside of the college group such as Clodagh or Fonzie. Obviously a film has limitations that do not hinder an author, but I would also have liked there to have been more back story for Nan - just why she chooses Simon, for example. And I could always use more interaction between Eve and Aidan, whose scenes in the book are richly comic and translate very well onto the screen. Despite my quibbles, I have always liked this film, and I would recommend it to most people, whether they have read the book or not, for its entertainment value.

    As much as I like Colin Firth ever since his portrayal in the A&E production of "Pride and Prejudice," "What a Girl Wants," and "Master of the Moor," I have to say that this movie was totally monotonous, dreary and tedious. A dull and boring and uninspired movie about girls in 1950's Ireland trying to find their womanhood through their drawers and the drawers of the men they are involved in. I had seen this movie before my interest in Firth's career and found the characters implausible and improbable. All the characters were unbelievable except perhaps the "Uriah Heep" of the movie played by Aidan Gillen which oiled up the screen really good and made you cringe with revulsion with his attack. No real conclusions of the movie except that Bernadette 'Benny' Hogan (Minnie Driver) decided to give sex a try. A real inspiring yawn . . .

    I was glad to see Chris O'Donnell in this movie. He did this to show the Irish side of him. As an Irishwoman, I loved that. O'Donnell shines as Jack Foley, the good-looking Rugby star who falls in love with Benny (Driver). O'Donnell plays Foley with suavity, sympathy & class. You like him; even when you find out about Nan. He just has a way of making you swoon. And I loved the accent. My favorite scene in this movie is Jack in a tuxedo. Talk about hot! Chris O'Donnell has always been good-looking, but wearing that tuxedo & speaking with an Irish accent made me swoon. Driver gives a star-is-born performance as Benny, the 'ordinary' girl who dreams of more than Knockglen. You feel her pain as she deals her whole life with not being the beauty Nan is; & cheer when Jack tells her he loves her. I discovered what a talent Alan Cumming is. His portrayal of Sean Walsh gave me the creeps; yet I kept hoping for more screen time. Geraldine O'Rawe is another breakthrough performance as Eve. She is a loyal friend to Benny & a joy to watch on screen. Her beauty & grace are unmatched in this film. A very sweet movie & a good addition to anyone's collection. If you are Irish, rent & enjoy this gem. If you are not, rent anyways. It just proves that sometimes the person you want may not be out of reach. Sometimes dreams do come true.

    This was a great movie, but it was a little different than the book. Spoilers: Nan was friends with Benny and Eve since childhood in the movie. In the book, they met at college. I liked O'Donald's character better in the movie than in the book. In the book, he acted like a jerk to Benny when she was too busy taking care of her widowed mother. In the movie, though he did feel a little lonely and got a little impatient,he (up until he cheated on her) was a little more understanding. In the book, I thought they implied that Benny got together with her, but I think she left it up to the author to decide. Other users says they did not get back together. In the movie, they definitely did get back together. I liked the part where Benny hit the bag over that creep's head and the money spilled out! Nan and Eve were great for their part. Although I do not consider O'Donald gorgeous, he is talented. I read some users comments. I also noticed the flaw they made when they said they were making their confirmation, (as other users stated) which was really the communion. However, that was not important to me. A lot of users were critical about the movie being so centered around sex. I agree with them, that it did get too much after a while, but those are real problems that teens and young adults faced then, and now. But back then they did not have sex education. (just guilt, from the catholic church)Perhaps if people talked to them about the real consequences of having sex (rather that preaching about it being a mortal sin)they would not have so much of a desire to have it. I think if this were a real story, Benny would have made a big mistake by having sex(obviously unprotected) and it would be a shame for a talented smart writer like Benny to ruin her chance of having a career; however, the movie ended there. I do not think it was made to teach you that you should have premarital sex, (though realistically it happened, even then, though it was just not talked of) It was made to entertain. It was a romantic love story, not a life lesson. A lot of people were disappointed by the fact that Benny gave Jack and second chance, but at least in the movie, he was not a jerk like he was in the book, as I said. Somebody said that the parents looked old for parents back then, but it was not unusual for women to take years to get pregnet, or to have many miscarriages (sadly). Back then they did not have the prenatal care that they have now, or ways of getting pregnet. The fact that she had only one child was also unusual for that time, which also implies that the mother probably took a long time to conceive. So I thought using older parents was appropriate, and backed up justly. Overall, a great movie!

    This review contains SPOILERS, I'm trying to save you from seeing this movie. I started watching this movie thinking I was going to like it. It looked like a coming of age tale, the 1950's Irish setting seemed appealing, the characters seemed interesting. The main character is a large, unattractive girl, Bennie, from a small town, and the story centers around her and her two friends, Eve and Nan. Eve was a simple girl with a moralistic bent, raised in a convent, while Nan grew up a sophisticated, big city girl in Dublin. The story really gets going while the three are at university. For a while it seemed like a sweet coming of age tale of some sort, but I should have been suspicious when all the excerpts of college lectures dealt with the sexual practices of savages, and with all the talk about sex, between the girls and between Bennie and her new boyfriend, a jock on campus and a pre-med major. The movie goes along pretty innocently for quite a while. The girls were in school, and it looked like the girls were striving to expand their horizons, improve their situation. They go to a dance and are caught up with boyfriends. Then a lot of the action is compressed in the last half hour of the movie, turning the whole thing into a big, sappy soap opera. Nan services some guy, get rejected by the buffoon when they discover she's pregnant, then seduces Bennie's boyfriend in an attempt to trick HIM into marrying her. Eve finds out, approaches Nan with a bread knife, causing Nan to fall, get cut, and lose the baby. The boyfriend then returns to Bennie and she takes him back, and the movie ends as these two are finally about to go all the way. As it ends, you don't feel uplifted, Bennie hasn't learned anything or grown, she remains a big, unattractive girl, now with a boyfriend that knows he graze in greener pastures once in a while and she'll take him back.

    This rating reflects my ambivalent feelings about the movie... I seem to recall the novel (which I read some years ago) as having a little more depth than the sexual experiences (or lack thereof) of its three heroines. The film comes off as a bit of a soap opera, 1950's Irish style. Although I'm not Catholic myself, my main problem with the movie (and Maeve Binchy's novels, to some extent) is the constant irritating depiction of the Catholic church as an oppressive institution that exists more or less for the primary purpose of sexually repressing its adherents. Also, the producers should have done some very basic research into Catholic traditions. As another reviewer also noted, it is extremely obvious (and not only to Catholics) that the opening religious ceremony in the film is not the three girls' Confirmation at all but their First Communion. The movie thus lost credibility to me from the outset. The movie tells the story of three Irish friends who are embarking upon their college days...Benny, a rather biggish (supposedly) self conscious girl, Eve, a quiet orphan raised by nuns, and Nan, a lovely would be sophisticate who sets her cap for the young Protestant country squire, Simon. For business purposes, Benny's father is encouraging his shop employee, Sean, to court his daughter. However, Benny has fallen in love with a handsome college classmate and rugby star named Jack. Meanwhile, Nan and Simon are conducting a clandestine affair in Eve's cottage. After Nan discovers that she is pregnant, Simon indicates that he has no intention of marrying a girl of her social / financial status and suggests an abortion. To get out of her pickle, Nan then proceeds to seduce Jack and attempt to pass her baby off as his child. Read the above... doesn't it all sound like a soap? Who's sleeping with who? Anyway, carrying on... Minnie Driver gives a marvelous, sympathetic portrayal of Benny, a young girl insecure over her appearance, caught up in her first love and awakening desires, pursued by an unwelcome suitor, trapped with familial obligations following her father's sudden death, and ultimately betrayed by her boyfriend and one of her best friends. She's beautiful at the dance when she first reveals her vulnerability to Jack. I agree with those who claim that Benny is not sufficiently large for the role, not 'big as a rhinoceros' at all...attractive figure, just pudgy face...but that's a minor detail. Chris O'Donnell is perfect as her dashing young love, convincing in his devastated reaction to the news of Nan's pregnancy and choosing to unhappily but nobly do the right thing, marry the girl. He's much more sympathetic in the movie, where he has only a one night moment of madness with Nan, than in the novel, where it's more of an affair. Eve seems well cast, but Sean's pilfering, lecherous, peeping tom character is definitely overdone, almost a caricature, as others have also noted. Nan's character is well captured here, as the viewer (this one, at least) has sympathy for her genuine sense of giving herself to Sean when she loses her virginity, her betrayal by him when he hears of her pregnancy, and even to some extent her dastardly deed to both Jack and Benny for her own selfish interests. One point well brought out is that while Nan believes herself to have contempt for Catholicism, when it comes to abortion, we see that she has internalized at least some of the teachings of her faith. Of course the Irish music is fantastic and the country scenery beautiful, the green hills, streams, and meandering roads. I was less impressed that the professor's lecture topics just happened to involve the sexual practices of savages. I certainly don't recall that from the novel, though it's been awhile. What is the likelihood that this would have been the class subject matter for a coed freshman class in Ireland back in the 1950's? The film has a different ending than the novel, which will disappoint some readers. Normally this would infuriate me, but I found surprisingly that I didn't mind. In the book, Benny forgives Jack and remains friends with him, but, having gained confidence and a sense of independence, moves on with her life. Here of course we see a less complex storybook type ending with the couple getting together. Pity she has sex with him at the end...of course with a parting dig at the Catholic Church ('Bless me, Father, for I have sinned'). At least it's apparently at Benny's own instigation, not in response to pressure from Jack. The movie is really mainly sex...either wanting it, talking about it, or having it. Not much else to the story. So...yes, a mixed review. Not the best morals and a certain mocking of Catholic teachings (or Christian teachings, in general), but kind of a touching story of first love, a sympathetic heroine, and that lovely Irish scenery.

    This was the first film of Minnie Driver I ever saw and I loved her in this role as the main character Benny (or Ben as her friends call her) whose coming of age story is told within the full circle of the film as is that of her friends. If you see Driver in this, she is a far cry from the glamour puss she has become today in Hollywood films, but her acting is still just as superb. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone with a taste or stamina for bawdy Irish jokes, rawness one only sees from the other-side of the pond from time to time and heartbreak that exists in the lives of everyone especially those just getting to know the world for what it truly is. Chris O' Donnell also appears in the film, as the charming young lad Benny falls in love with. Alan Cumming (in another stereotypically sinister role), Colin Firth and Saffron Burrows also co-star.

    Spoilers in this review, please do not read if you don't want the movie ruined. I read the book and to be honest, was very bored with it from the start, but once I start a book, I always finish. Well, about a day after I finished the book, I found the movie online and decided to buy it and figured maybe it would be better. I was so very wrong. Minnie Driver isn't even close to being "a barrel of a girl" or an "elephant" as she was called in the book many many times. You could even see her bones popping out of her skin through most of the movie. The whole point of the book and the story is that you don't have to be a beauty or thin or perfect. Benny seemed to be the same size as the other girls with a little chubbier face. They also completely changed the ending, she turns Jack down flat and moves on with her life (in the book) instead of pining away over the man who broke her heart and ending up back with him.(in the movie) I have many more complaints about the differences but I will spare you. Both the movie and the book are pretty much boring, I wouldn't waste your time with either of them.

    I just watched this movie with my teen-aged daughter. We both enjoyed it, and it brought an opportunity to think and talk about teen-aged sexual matters, especially "first-time" sex. However, we did find an error in this Irish-Catholic movie, and that was in the opening scene where the three girls were receiving "Confirmation." In fact, they were receiving their First Holy Communion. This error was shocking! We expected to find it listed as a "goof" in the IMDb listing, but no goofs were given. Another thing we thought very strange was that Benny's parents looked so very old--old enough to be her grandparents. Considering the time line of the movie, most first-time parents in the '50s would have been young (20-ish, not 40-ish) when their first child was born. Maybe in the book it tells that the parents were older first-time parents. Overall, a very enjoyable film.

    This rating reflects my ambivalent feelings about the movie... I seem to recall the novel (which I read some years ago) as having a little more depth than the sexual experiences (or lack thereof) of its three heroines. The film comes off as a bit of a soap opera, 1950's Irish style. Although I'm not Catholic myself, my main problem with the movie (and Maeve Binchy's novels, to some extent) is the constant irritating depiction of the Catholic church as an oppressive institution that exists more or less for the primary purpose of sexually repressing its adherents. Also, the producers should have done some very basic research into Catholic traditions. As another reviewer also noted, it is extremely obvious (and not only to Catholics) that the opening religious ceremony in the film is not the three girls' Confirmation at all but their First Communion. The movie thus lost credibility to me from the outset. The movie tells the story of three Irish friends who are embarking upon their college days...Benny, a rather biggish (supposedly) self conscious girl, Eve, a quiet orphan raised by nuns, and Nan, a lovely would be sophisticate who sets her cap for the young Protestant country squire, Simon. For business purposes, Benny's father is encouraging his shop employee, Sean, to court his daughter. However, Benny has fallen in love with a handsome college classmate and rugby star named Jack. Meanwhile, Nan and Simon are conducting a clandestine affair in Eve's cottage. After Nan discovers that she is pregnant, Simon indicates that he has no intention of marrying a girl of her social / financial status and suggests an abortion. To get out of her pickle, Nan then proceeds to seduce Jack and attempt to pass her baby off as his child. Read the above... doesn't it all sound like a soap? Who's sleeping with who? Anyway, carrying on... Minnie Driver gives a marvelous, sympathetic portrayal of Benny, a young girl insecure over her appearance, caught up in her first love and awakening desires, pursued by an unwelcome suitor, trapped with familial obligations following her father's sudden death, and ultimately betrayed by her boyfriend and one of her best friends. She's beautiful at the dance when she first reveals her vulnerability to Jack. I agree with those who claim that Benny is not sufficiently large for the role, not 'big as a rhinoceros' at all...attractive figure, just pudgy face...but that's a minor detail. Chris O'Donnell is perfect as her dashing young love, convincing in his devastated reaction to the news of Nan's pregnancy and choosing to unhappily but nobly do the right thing, marry the girl. He's much more sympathetic in the movie, where he has only a one night moment of madness with Nan, than in the novel, where it's more of an affair. Eve seems well cast, but Sean's pilfering, lecherous, peeping tom character is definitely overdone, almost a caricature, as others have also noted. Nan's character is well captured here, as the viewer (this one, at least) has sympathy for her genuine sense of giving herself to Sean when she loses her virginity, her betrayal by him when he hears of her pregnancy, and even to some extent her dastardly deed to both Jack and Benny for her own selfish interests. One point well brought out is that while Nan believes herself to have contempt for Catholicism, when it comes to abortion, we see that she has internalized at least some of the teachings of her faith. Of course the Irish music is fantastic and the country scenery beautiful, the green hills, streams, and meandering roads. I was less impressed that the professor's lecture topics just happened to involve the sexual practices of savages. I certainly don't recall that from the novel, though it's been awhile. What is the likelihood that this would have been the class subject matter for a coed freshman class in Ireland back in the 1950's? The film has a different ending than the novel, which will disappoint some readers. Normally this would infuriate me, but I found surprisingly that I didn't mind. In the book, Benny forgives Jack and remains friends with him, but, having gained confidence and a sense of independence, moves on with her life. Here of course we see a less complex storybook type ending with the couple getting together. Pity she has sex with him at the end...of course with a parting dig at the Catholic Church ('Bless me, Father, for I have sinned'). At least it's apparently at Benny's own instigation, not in response to pressure from Jack. The movie is really mainly sex...either wanting it, talking about it, or having it. Not much else to the story. So...yes, a mixed review. Not the best morals and a certain mocking of Catholic teachings (or Christian teachings, in general), but kind of a touching story of first love, a sympathetic heroine, and that lovely Irish scenery.

    This was the first film of Minnie Driver I ever saw and I loved her in this role as the main character Benny (or Ben as her friends call her) whose coming of age story is told within the full circle of the film as is that of her friends. If you see Driver in this, she is a far cry from the glamour puss she has become today in Hollywood films, but her acting is still just as superb. I truly enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone with a taste or stamina for bawdy Irish jokes, rawness one only sees from the other-side of the pond from time to time and heartbreak that exists in the lives of everyone especially those just getting to know the world for what it truly is. Chris O' Donnell also appears in the film, as the charming young lad Benny falls in love with. Alan Cumming (in another stereotypically sinister role), Colin Firth and Saffron Burrows also co-star.

    Spoilers in this review, please do not read if you don't want the movie ruined. I read the book and to be honest, was very bored with it from the start, but once I start a book, I always finish. Well, about a day after I finished the book, I found the movie online and decided to buy it and figured maybe it would be better. I was so very wrong. Minnie Driver isn't even close to being "a barrel of a girl" or an "elephant" as she was called in the book many many times. You could even see her bones popping out of her skin through most of the movie. The whole point of the book and the story is that you don't have to be a beauty or thin or perfect. Benny seemed to be the same size as the other girls with a little chubbier face. They also completely changed the ending, she turns Jack down flat and moves on with her life (in the book) instead of pining away over the man who broke her heart and ending up back with him.(in the movie) I have many more complaints about the differences but I will spare you. Both the movie and the book are pretty much boring, I wouldn't waste your time with either of them.

    I just watched this movie with my teen-aged daughter. We both enjoyed it, and it brought an opportunity to think and talk about teen-aged sexual matters, especially "first-time" sex. However, we did find an error in this Irish-Catholic movie, and that was in the opening scene where the three girls were receiving "Confirmation." In fact, they were receiving their First Holy Communion. This error was shocking! We expected to find it listed as a "goof" in the IMDb listing, but no goofs were given. Another thing we thought very strange was that Benny's parents looked so very old--old enough to be her grandparents. Considering the time line of the movie, most first-time parents in the '50s would have been young (20-ish, not 40-ish) when their first child was born. Maybe in the book it tells that the parents were older first-time parents. Overall, a very enjoyable film.
