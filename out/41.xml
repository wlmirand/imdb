    almost bald,ugly,gay,unqualified and a principal.. Qualified and super hot but still a 3rd grade teacher.. Billy Maddison is a movie that deals with a harsh reality,that movies with no real plot lines are superhits... Really good movie with some quotable dialogs and Adam Sandler is funny as always... A joke or two about his weirdly shapped head and the hillariousness is a guaranteed in Adam Sandler movies.. But still after its good moments begins to be just dragging through to takeup some footage.. Despite the flaws and stuff..It was commercially successful and part of the name of Sandler's company "Happy Madison" Named after 2 hits Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison..

    The nineties were kind to Adam Sandler, what with his Saturday Night Live career taking off to new heights and movie deals coming left and right. Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst. And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them "stupid movies," call them "turn your brain off films," I call these kinds of films, "anti-character studies," when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying. Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his "nudie magazines" in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy). Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival. All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, "for a laugh." Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this "the best Adam Sandler movie." Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day. Starring: Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by: Tamra Davis.

    Billy Madison is Adam Sandler's break-out film. The film that gave him the attention he deserved. The story is that of a supposedly idiot 27- year-old who has a rich dad who owns a company. When Billy's father says that he will give the company to Eric, a business associate, Billy dislikes this idea and decides to go back to school and finish 1st grade to 12th grade so he can prove he's not an idiot. Right from the get-go it's silly. It's just plain stupid, childish humor but it's hilarious. I laughed so many times and it is completely re-watchable. And, out of nowhere, there is a Godfather reference thrown in their as well. I know I might get bashed for this, but to be honest, it was actually pretty smart. Well most of it anyway. I mean, it's the story of an idiot who has to complete 1st to 12th grade all over again. The storyline is called upon for juvenile humor. But, whatever. It's pretty hilarious. Although if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this.

    'Billy Madison' is Total Time-Pass. From start to end, this 1995 box-office hit, delivers funny moments, along-with a terrific performance by the lovable Adam Sandler. 'Billy Madison' Synopsis: In order to inherit his fed up father's hotel empire, an immature and lazy man must repeat grades 1-12 all over again. 'Billy Madison' is funny & relaxing. The humor is loud at times, but overall, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The jokes truly worked for me! The Screenplay Written by Tim Herlihy & Sandler himself, is entertaining & funny. Tamra Davis's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sandler delivers a terrific performance. He's the soul of the film. Bridgette Wilson is bewitching. Bradley Whitford plays the antagonist with sincerity. Darren McGavin is credible. Josh Mostel is remarkable. The Late Chris Farley & Steve Buscemi appear in small cameos. On the whole, 'Billy Madison' is a winner.

    One of the first of Adam Sandler's many great comedy films, Billy Madison is uniquely dumb yet hilarious. It chronicles the path for Billy to branch out from his everyday life of daiquiris and drunken debauchery with his fellow loser friends jack and frank, and go "back to school" to repeat all grades k-12 in a weeks time each. Doing so will be the only way he can convince his father to leave Billy his hotel empire. Watching Billy go through each grade again is full of so many random moments of laughter not to mention the love interest of miss Veronica Vaughn. All in all it is a classic as far as comedies go and I would recommend it for anyone.

    Hey Kids, It's Adam Sandler Week! Our first movie of the week is Billy Madison a movie about Billy played by Adam Sandler who is 30 years old and is what you would call a slacker. Billy has just found out that his rich dad just passed him on through high school and did not really graduate. So to prove that he can accomplish something he goes through all 12 grades again one grade per 2 weeks. This is a very funny movie with a very talented cast and really well thought out story. It seems that a lot of critics do not have a very good sense of humor because a lot of them either dismiss this movie or some really bash this movie for its un-originality. Rated PG-13 For Language And Crude Humor. 1hr 30min/90min. ****/****

    This is a strange movie because it stars Adam Sandler yet he behaves very much like Jim Carey. I guess one could place Jim Carey into Adam Sandler's spot and we would not notice much different. Sandler though seems to be able to go serious at times, yet so did Carey in the Truman Show, which I consider to be his crowning glory. Still, Billy Madison is not a Jim Carey movie so we cannot treat it as such. Billy Madison is a rich kid. His father owns the Madison hotel chain and is thinking of retiring. He wants to give the hotel chain to his son, but Billy is just really bizarre, more like insane. The movie opens we him chasing a non-existent penguin through the grounds while his father's business associates are arriving for dinner. Watching Billy's behaviour, his father decides to hand the business over to a greedy business man who hates Billy, but Billy, who got through school by paying the right people, makes a deal with his dad. He passes school, doing one grade every two weeks, he gets the company. It starts of with Billy wanting to get through school, but this experience seriously changes his life. He begins with the goal of becoming a corporate director, but really warms to the children. Not only that, but he begins a relationship with one of the teachers, Veronica. She starts off hating him but soon comes to realise that Billy really does have a heart of gold, and not only that but he really gets along with the children. Still there is the antagonist who desires to see Billy fail so that he can get the business, but Billy is the type of guy who picks up friend's very quickly. As such he allies himself not only with the kids at school, but Ralph, another of his father's business associates, who helps him through the school. Billy Madison is a quaint little movie. It is funny and enjoyable to watch, especially those who appreciate toilet humour. It does not and will not go down in time as a classic, but it is something that can be watched for a laugh. The question though is what was the other Adam Sandler movie that I saw other than Airheads, if I have seen one.

    Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries. A few great one-liners from this one still pop up in my vocabulary today, but not with anywhere near the frequency of the best moments from Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. Like the original Ace Ventura, it hasn't aged spectacularly but there are worse ways to kill ninety minutes.

    Adam Sandler is rather hit and miss for me, sometimes he's good but he can be irritating. Luckily for this film he is good in it and his character is one of the zanier and more likable ones he's played, and Billy Madison overall is one of his better films. It is not perfect, the premise is silly and the story is predictable with one too many aimless scenes. On the other hand, the film looks good and has a nice soundtrack. The film is funny, well directed and has some funny sequences such as the "stop looking at me, swan" one. Sandler is good, and there is a sterling support cast, Bradley Whitford faring best. In conclusion, a dumb but entertaining movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    Adam Sandler is rather hit and miss for me, sometimes he's good but he can be irritating. Luckily for this film he is good in it and his character is one of the zanier and more likable ones he's played, and Billy Madison overall is one of his better films. It is not perfect, the premise is silly and the story is predictable with one too many aimless scenes. On the other hand, the film looks good and has a nice soundtrack. The film is funny, well directed and has some funny sequences such as the "stop looking at me, swan" one. Sandler is good, and there is a sterling support cast, Bradley Whitford faring best. In conclusion, a dumb but entertaining movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    almost bald,ugly,gay,unqualified and a principal.. Qualified and super hot but still a 3rd grade teacher.. Billy Maddison is a movie that deals with a harsh reality,that movies with no real plot lines are superhits... Really good movie with some quotable dialogs and Adam Sandler is funny as always... A joke or two about his weirdly shapped head and the hillariousness is a guaranteed in Adam Sandler movies.. But still after its good moments begins to be just dragging through to takeup some footage.. Despite the flaws and stuff..It was commercially successful and part of the name of Sandler's company "Happy Madison" Named after 2 hits Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison..

    The nineties were kind to Adam Sandler, what with his Saturday Night Live career taking off to new heights and movie deals coming left and right. Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst. And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them "stupid movies," call them "turn your brain off films," I call these kinds of films, "anti-character studies," when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying. Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his "nudie magazines" in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy). Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival. All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, "for a laugh." Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this "the best Adam Sandler movie." Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day. Starring: Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by: Tamra Davis.

    Billy Madison is Adam Sandler's break-out film. The film that gave him the attention he deserved. The story is that of a supposedly idiot 27- year-old who has a rich dad who owns a company. When Billy's father says that he will give the company to Eric, a business associate, Billy dislikes this idea and decides to go back to school and finish 1st grade to 12th grade so he can prove he's not an idiot. Right from the get-go it's silly. It's just plain stupid, childish humor but it's hilarious. I laughed so many times and it is completely re-watchable. And, out of nowhere, there is a Godfather reference thrown in their as well. I know I might get bashed for this, but to be honest, it was actually pretty smart. Well most of it anyway. I mean, it's the story of an idiot who has to complete 1st to 12th grade all over again. The storyline is called upon for juvenile humor. But, whatever. It's pretty hilarious. Although if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this.

    'Billy Madison' is Total Time-Pass. From start to end, this 1995 box-office hit, delivers funny moments, along-with a terrific performance by the lovable Adam Sandler. 'Billy Madison' Synopsis: In order to inherit his fed up father's hotel empire, an immature and lazy man must repeat grades 1-12 all over again. 'Billy Madison' is funny & relaxing. The humor is loud at times, but overall, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The jokes truly worked for me! The Screenplay Written by Tim Herlihy & Sandler himself, is entertaining & funny. Tamra Davis's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sandler delivers a terrific performance. He's the soul of the film. Bridgette Wilson is bewitching. Bradley Whitford plays the antagonist with sincerity. Darren McGavin is credible. Josh Mostel is remarkable. The Late Chris Farley & Steve Buscemi appear in small cameos. On the whole, 'Billy Madison' is a winner.

    One of the first of Adam Sandler's many great comedy films, Billy Madison is uniquely dumb yet hilarious. It chronicles the path for Billy to branch out from his everyday life of daiquiris and drunken debauchery with his fellow loser friends jack and frank, and go "back to school" to repeat all grades k-12 in a weeks time each. Doing so will be the only way he can convince his father to leave Billy his hotel empire. Watching Billy go through each grade again is full of so many random moments of laughter not to mention the love interest of miss Veronica Vaughn. All in all it is a classic as far as comedies go and I would recommend it for anyone.

    Hey Kids, It's Adam Sandler Week! Our first movie of the week is Billy Madison a movie about Billy played by Adam Sandler who is 30 years old and is what you would call a slacker. Billy has just found out that his rich dad just passed him on through high school and did not really graduate. So to prove that he can accomplish something he goes through all 12 grades again one grade per 2 weeks. This is a very funny movie with a very talented cast and really well thought out story. It seems that a lot of critics do not have a very good sense of humor because a lot of them either dismiss this movie or some really bash this movie for its un-originality. Rated PG-13 For Language And Crude Humor. 1hr 30min/90min. ****/****

    This is a strange movie because it stars Adam Sandler yet he behaves very much like Jim Carey. I guess one could place Jim Carey into Adam Sandler's spot and we would not notice much different. Sandler though seems to be able to go serious at times, yet so did Carey in the Truman Show, which I consider to be his crowning glory. Still, Billy Madison is not a Jim Carey movie so we cannot treat it as such. Billy Madison is a rich kid. His father owns the Madison hotel chain and is thinking of retiring. He wants to give the hotel chain to his son, but Billy is just really bizarre, more like insane. The movie opens we him chasing a non-existent penguin through the grounds while his father's business associates are arriving for dinner. Watching Billy's behaviour, his father decides to hand the business over to a greedy business man who hates Billy, but Billy, who got through school by paying the right people, makes a deal with his dad. He passes school, doing one grade every two weeks, he gets the company. It starts of with Billy wanting to get through school, but this experience seriously changes his life. He begins with the goal of becoming a corporate director, but really warms to the children. Not only that, but he begins a relationship with one of the teachers, Veronica. She starts off hating him but soon comes to realise that Billy really does have a heart of gold, and not only that but he really gets along with the children. Still there is the antagonist who desires to see Billy fail so that he can get the business, but Billy is the type of guy who picks up friend's very quickly. As such he allies himself not only with the kids at school, but Ralph, another of his father's business associates, who helps him through the school. Billy Madison is a quaint little movie. It is funny and enjoyable to watch, especially those who appreciate toilet humour. It does not and will not go down in time as a classic, but it is something that can be watched for a laugh. The question though is what was the other Adam Sandler movie that I saw other than Airheads, if I have seen one.

    Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries. A few great one-liners from this one still pop up in my vocabulary today, but not with anywhere near the frequency of the best moments from Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. Like the original Ace Ventura, it hasn't aged spectacularly but there are worse ways to kill ninety minutes.

    The nineties were kind to Adam Sandler, what with his Saturday Night Live career taking off to new heights and movie deals coming left and right. Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst. And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them "stupid movies," call them "turn your brain off films," I call these kinds of films, "anti-character studies," when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying. Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his "nudie magazines" in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy). Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival. All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, "for a laugh." Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this "the best Adam Sandler movie." Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day. Starring: Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by: Tamra Davis.

    Billy Madison is Adam Sandler's break-out film. The film that gave him the attention he deserved. The story is that of a supposedly idiot 27- year-old who has a rich dad who owns a company. When Billy's father says that he will give the company to Eric, a business associate, Billy dislikes this idea and decides to go back to school and finish 1st grade to 12th grade so he can prove he's not an idiot. Right from the get-go it's silly. It's just plain stupid, childish humor but it's hilarious. I laughed so many times and it is completely re-watchable. And, out of nowhere, there is a Godfather reference thrown in their as well. I know I might get bashed for this, but to be honest, it was actually pretty smart. Well most of it anyway. I mean, it's the story of an idiot who has to complete 1st to 12th grade all over again. The storyline is called upon for juvenile humor. But, whatever. It's pretty hilarious. Although if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this.

    'Billy Madison' is Total Time-Pass. From start to end, this 1995 box-office hit, delivers funny moments, along-with a terrific performance by the lovable Adam Sandler. 'Billy Madison' Synopsis: In order to inherit his fed up father's hotel empire, an immature and lazy man must repeat grades 1-12 all over again. 'Billy Madison' is funny & relaxing. The humor is loud at times, but overall, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The jokes truly worked for me! The Screenplay Written by Tim Herlihy & Sandler himself, is entertaining & funny. Tamra Davis's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sandler delivers a terrific performance. He's the soul of the film. Bridgette Wilson is bewitching. Bradley Whitford plays the antagonist with sincerity. Darren McGavin is credible. Josh Mostel is remarkable. The Late Chris Farley & Steve Buscemi appear in small cameos. On the whole, 'Billy Madison' is a winner.

    One of the first of Adam Sandler's many great comedy films, Billy Madison is uniquely dumb yet hilarious. It chronicles the path for Billy to branch out from his everyday life of daiquiris and drunken debauchery with his fellow loser friends jack and frank, and go "back to school" to repeat all grades k-12 in a weeks time each. Doing so will be the only way he can convince his father to leave Billy his hotel empire. Watching Billy go through each grade again is full of so many random moments of laughter not to mention the love interest of miss Veronica Vaughn. All in all it is a classic as far as comedies go and I would recommend it for anyone.

    Hey Kids, It's Adam Sandler Week! Our first movie of the week is Billy Madison a movie about Billy played by Adam Sandler who is 30 years old and is what you would call a slacker. Billy has just found out that his rich dad just passed him on through high school and did not really graduate. So to prove that he can accomplish something he goes through all 12 grades again one grade per 2 weeks. This is a very funny movie with a very talented cast and really well thought out story. It seems that a lot of critics do not have a very good sense of humor because a lot of them either dismiss this movie or some really bash this movie for its un-originality. Rated PG-13 For Language And Crude Humor. 1hr 30min/90min. ****/****

    This is a strange movie because it stars Adam Sandler yet he behaves very much like Jim Carey. I guess one could place Jim Carey into Adam Sandler's spot and we would not notice much different. Sandler though seems to be able to go serious at times, yet so did Carey in the Truman Show, which I consider to be his crowning glory. Still, Billy Madison is not a Jim Carey movie so we cannot treat it as such. Billy Madison is a rich kid. His father owns the Madison hotel chain and is thinking of retiring. He wants to give the hotel chain to his son, but Billy is just really bizarre, more like insane. The movie opens we him chasing a non-existent penguin through the grounds while his father's business associates are arriving for dinner. Watching Billy's behaviour, his father decides to hand the business over to a greedy business man who hates Billy, but Billy, who got through school by paying the right people, makes a deal with his dad. He passes school, doing one grade every two weeks, he gets the company. It starts of with Billy wanting to get through school, but this experience seriously changes his life. He begins with the goal of becoming a corporate director, but really warms to the children. Not only that, but he begins a relationship with one of the teachers, Veronica. She starts off hating him but soon comes to realise that Billy really does have a heart of gold, and not only that but he really gets along with the children. Still there is the antagonist who desires to see Billy fail so that he can get the business, but Billy is the type of guy who picks up friend's very quickly. As such he allies himself not only with the kids at school, but Ralph, another of his father's business associates, who helps him through the school. Billy Madison is a quaint little movie. It is funny and enjoyable to watch, especially those who appreciate toilet humour. It does not and will not go down in time as a classic, but it is something that can be watched for a laugh. The question though is what was the other Adam Sandler movie that I saw other than Airheads, if I have seen one.

    Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries. A few great one-liners from this one still pop up in my vocabulary today, but not with anywhere near the frequency of the best moments from Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. Like the original Ace Ventura, it hasn't aged spectacularly but there are worse ways to kill ninety minutes.

    Adam Sandler is rather hit and miss for me, sometimes he's good but he can be irritating. Luckily for this film he is good in it and his character is one of the zanier and more likable ones he's played, and Billy Madison overall is one of his better films. It is not perfect, the premise is silly and the story is predictable with one too many aimless scenes. On the other hand, the film looks good and has a nice soundtrack. The film is funny, well directed and has some funny sequences such as the "stop looking at me, swan" one. Sandler is good, and there is a sterling support cast, Bradley Whitford faring best. In conclusion, a dumb but entertaining movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst. And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them "stupid movies," call them "turn your brain off films," I call these kinds of films, "anti-character studies," when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying. Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his "nudie magazines" in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy). Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival. All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, "for a laugh." Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this "the best Adam Sandler movie." Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day. Starring: Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by: Tamra Davis.

    Billy Madison is Adam Sandler's break-out film. The film that gave him the attention he deserved. The story is that of a supposedly idiot 27- year-old who has a rich dad who owns a company. When Billy's father says that he will give the company to Eric, a business associate, Billy dislikes this idea and decides to go back to school and finish 1st grade to 12th grade so he can prove he's not an idiot. Right from the get-go it's silly. It's just plain stupid, childish humor but it's hilarious. I laughed so many times and it is completely re-watchable. And, out of nowhere, there is a Godfather reference thrown in their as well. I know I might get bashed for this, but to be honest, it was actually pretty smart. Well most of it anyway. I mean, it's the story of an idiot who has to complete 1st to 12th grade all over again. The storyline is called upon for juvenile humor. But, whatever. It's pretty hilarious. Although if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this.

    'Billy Madison' is Total Time-Pass. From start to end, this 1995 box-office hit, delivers funny moments, along-with a terrific performance by the lovable Adam Sandler. 'Billy Madison' Synopsis: In order to inherit his fed up father's hotel empire, an immature and lazy man must repeat grades 1-12 all over again. 'Billy Madison' is funny & relaxing. The humor is loud at times, but overall, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The jokes truly worked for me! The Screenplay Written by Tim Herlihy & Sandler himself, is entertaining & funny. Tamra Davis's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sandler delivers a terrific performance. He's the soul of the film. Bridgette Wilson is bewitching. Bradley Whitford plays the antagonist with sincerity. Darren McGavin is credible. Josh Mostel is remarkable. The Late Chris Farley & Steve Buscemi appear in small cameos. On the whole, 'Billy Madison' is a winner.

    One of the first of Adam Sandler's many great comedy films, Billy Madison is uniquely dumb yet hilarious. It chronicles the path for Billy to branch out from his everyday life of daiquiris and drunken debauchery with his fellow loser friends jack and frank, and go "back to school" to repeat all grades k-12 in a weeks time each. Doing so will be the only way he can convince his father to leave Billy his hotel empire. Watching Billy go through each grade again is full of so many random moments of laughter not to mention the love interest of miss Veronica Vaughn. All in all it is a classic as far as comedies go and I would recommend it for anyone.

    Hey Kids, It's Adam Sandler Week! Our first movie of the week is Billy Madison a movie about Billy played by Adam Sandler who is 30 years old and is what you would call a slacker. Billy has just found out that his rich dad just passed him on through high school and did not really graduate. So to prove that he can accomplish something he goes through all 12 grades again one grade per 2 weeks. This is a very funny movie with a very talented cast and really well thought out story. It seems that a lot of critics do not have a very good sense of humor because a lot of them either dismiss this movie or some really bash this movie for its un-originality. Rated PG-13 For Language And Crude Humor. 1hr 30min/90min. ****/****

    This is a strange movie because it stars Adam Sandler yet he behaves very much like Jim Carey. I guess one could place Jim Carey into Adam Sandler's spot and we would not notice much different. Sandler though seems to be able to go serious at times, yet so did Carey in the Truman Show, which I consider to be his crowning glory. Still, Billy Madison is not a Jim Carey movie so we cannot treat it as such. Billy Madison is a rich kid. His father owns the Madison hotel chain and is thinking of retiring. He wants to give the hotel chain to his son, but Billy is just really bizarre, more like insane. The movie opens we him chasing a non-existent penguin through the grounds while his father's business associates are arriving for dinner. Watching Billy's behaviour, his father decides to hand the business over to a greedy business man who hates Billy, but Billy, who got through school by paying the right people, makes a deal with his dad. He passes school, doing one grade every two weeks, he gets the company. It starts of with Billy wanting to get through school, but this experience seriously changes his life. He begins with the goal of becoming a corporate director, but really warms to the children. Not only that, but he begins a relationship with one of the teachers, Veronica. She starts off hating him but soon comes to realise that Billy really does have a heart of gold, and not only that but he really gets along with the children. Still there is the antagonist who desires to see Billy fail so that he can get the business, but Billy is the type of guy who picks up friend's very quickly. As such he allies himself not only with the kids at school, but Ralph, another of his father's business associates, who helps him through the school. Billy Madison is a quaint little movie. It is funny and enjoyable to watch, especially those who appreciate toilet humour. It does not and will not go down in time as a classic, but it is something that can be watched for a laugh. The question though is what was the other Adam Sandler movie that I saw other than Airheads, if I have seen one.

    Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries. A few great one-liners from this one still pop up in my vocabulary today, but not with anywhere near the frequency of the best moments from Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. Like the original Ace Ventura, it hasn't aged spectacularly but there are worse ways to kill ninety minutes.

    Adam Sandler is rather hit and miss for me, sometimes he's good but he can be irritating. Luckily for this film he is good in it and his character is one of the zanier and more likable ones he's played, and Billy Madison overall is one of his better films. It is not perfect, the premise is silly and the story is predictable with one too many aimless scenes. On the other hand, the film looks good and has a nice soundtrack. The film is funny, well directed and has some funny sequences such as the "stop looking at me, swan" one. Sandler is good, and there is a sterling support cast, Bradley Whitford faring best. In conclusion, a dumb but entertaining movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox

Billy Maddison is a movie that deals with a harsh reality,that movies with no real plot lines are superhits... Really good movie with some quotable dialogs and Adam Sandler is funny as always... A joke or two about his weirdly shapped head and the hillariousness is a guaranteed in Adam Sandler movies.. But still after its good moments begins to be just dragging through to takeup some footage.. Despite the flaws and stuff..It was commercially successful and part of the name of Sandler's company "Happy Madison" Named after 2 hits Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison..

Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival. All likability for the Billy Madison character is destroyed after the first few minutes as well. What's his reason for acting so goofy and simple? How did he become so ridiculously incompetent when he has an immensely successful father? And why does he so often commit random acts of senselessness like throwing dodgeballs at young kids and even making his shampoo and conditioner argue in the bathtub. Those questions can all be answered with, "for a laugh." Billy Madison's formula is contrived and hopelessly unremarkable. Its humor stems directly from laughing down at the character when we wonder if he can actually help it or not. Sandler's screen presence grows stale and unbelievably intolerable after only a few short minutes and we are left with an implausible story, a monotonous line of events, and a character we feel nothing for. I'm astonished when people call this "the best Adam Sandler movie." Have these same people seen Reign Over Me? Probably not; they would not give an Adam Sandler drama the time of day. Starring: Adam Sandler, Bradley Whitford, Bridgette Wilson, Norm Macdonald, and Darren McGavin. Directed by: Tamra Davis.

    Billy Madison is Adam Sandler's break-out film. The film that gave him the attention he deserved. The story is that of a supposedly idiot 27- year-old who has a rich dad who owns a company. When Billy's father says that he will give the company to Eric, a business associate, Billy dislikes this idea and decides to go back to school and finish 1st grade to 12th grade so he can prove he's not an idiot. Right from the get-go it's silly. It's just plain stupid, childish humor but it's hilarious. I laughed so many times and it is completely re-watchable. And, out of nowhere, there is a Godfather reference thrown in their as well. I know I might get bashed for this, but to be honest, it was actually pretty smart. Well most of it anyway. I mean, it's the story of an idiot who has to complete 1st to 12th grade all over again. The storyline is called upon for juvenile humor. But, whatever. It's pretty hilarious. Although if you don't like Sandler you probably won't like this.

    'Billy Madison' is Total Time-Pass. From start to end, this 1995 box-office hit, delivers funny moments, along-with a terrific performance by the lovable Adam Sandler. 'Billy Madison' Synopsis: In order to inherit his fed up father's hotel empire, an immature and lazy man must repeat grades 1-12 all over again. 'Billy Madison' is funny & relaxing. The humor is loud at times, but overall, I enjoyed myself thoroughly. The jokes truly worked for me! The Screenplay Written by Tim Herlihy & Sandler himself, is entertaining & funny. Tamra Davis's Direction is decent. Performance-Wise: As mentioned, Sandler delivers a terrific performance. He's the soul of the film. Bridgette Wilson is bewitching. Bradley Whitford plays the antagonist with sincerity. Darren McGavin is credible. Josh Mostel is remarkable. The Late Chris Farley & Steve Buscemi appear in small cameos. On the whole, 'Billy Madison' is a winner.

    One of the first of Adam Sandler's many great comedy films, Billy Madison is uniquely dumb yet hilarious. It chronicles the path for Billy to branch out from his everyday life of daiquiris and drunken debauchery with his fellow loser friends jack and frank, and go "back to school" to repeat all grades k-12 in a weeks time each. Doing so will be the only way he can convince his father to leave Billy his hotel empire. Watching Billy go through each grade again is full of so many random moments of laughter not to mention the love interest of miss Veronica Vaughn. All in all it is a classic as far as comedies go and I would recommend it for anyone.

    Hey Kids, It's Adam Sandler Week! Our first movie of the week is Billy Madison a movie about Billy played by Adam Sandler who is 30 years old and is what you would call a slacker. Billy has just found out that his rich dad just passed him on through high school and did not really graduate. So to prove that he can accomplish something he goes through all 12 grades again one grade per 2 weeks. This is a very funny movie with a very talented cast and really well thought out story. It seems that a lot of critics do not have a very good sense of humor because a lot of them either dismiss this movie or some really bash this movie for its un-originality. Rated PG-13 For Language And Crude Humor. 1hr 30min/90min. ****/****

    This is a strange movie because it stars Adam Sandler yet he behaves very much like Jim Carey. I guess one could place Jim Carey into Adam Sandler's spot and we would not notice much different. Sandler though seems to be able to go serious at times, yet so did Carey in the Truman Show, which I consider to be his crowning glory. Still, Billy Madison is not a Jim Carey movie so we cannot treat it as such. Billy Madison is a rich kid. His father owns the Madison hotel chain and is thinking of retiring. He wants to give the hotel chain to his son, but Billy is just really bizarre, more like insane. The movie opens we him chasing a non-existent penguin through the grounds while his father's business associates are arriving for dinner. Watching Billy's behaviour, his father decides to hand the business over to a greedy business man who hates Billy, but Billy, who got through school by paying the right people, makes a deal with his dad. He passes school, doing one grade every two weeks, he gets the company. It starts of with Billy wanting to get through school, but this experience seriously changes his life. He begins with the goal of becoming a corporate director, but really warms to the children. Not only that, but he begins a relationship with one of the teachers, Veronica. She starts off hating him but soon comes to realise that Billy really does have a heart of gold, and not only that but he really gets along with the children. Still there is the antagonist who desires to see Billy fail so that he can get the business, but Billy is the type of guy who picks up friend's very quickly. As such he allies himself not only with the kids at school, but Ralph, another of his father's business associates, who helps him through the school. Billy Madison is a quaint little movie. It is funny and enjoyable to watch, especially those who appreciate toilet humour. It does not and will not go down in time as a classic, but it is something that can be watched for a laugh. The question though is what was the other Adam Sandler movie that I saw other than Airheads, if I have seen one.

    Born right in the heart of the golden era of SNL goofball idiot comedy, this lands somewhere near the middle of the pack in terms of overall watchability. It's a completely moronic premise that serves as nothing more than a thin vehicle to move from one throwaway sight gag to the next, but never has any illusions about evolving into something bigger. The film sticks with its bread and butter, a series of skits that would've been right at home on a particularly brainless episode of SNL, while dedicating as little time as possible to furthering the plot. Fortunately, many of the jokes and puns are still genuinely funny, although the ratio between those that kill and those that go down in flames is pretty weak when compared to some of its contemporaries. A few great one-liners from this one still pop up in my vocabulary today, but not with anywhere near the frequency of the best moments from Wayne's World or Tommy Boy. Like the original Ace Ventura, it hasn't aged spectacularly but there are worse ways to kill ninety minutes.

    Adam Sandler is rather hit and miss for me, sometimes he's good but he can be irritating. Luckily for this film he is good in it and his character is one of the zanier and more likable ones he's played, and Billy Madison overall is one of his better films. It is not perfect, the premise is silly and the story is predictable with one too many aimless scenes. On the other hand, the film looks good and has a nice soundtrack. The film is funny, well directed and has some funny sequences such as the "stop looking at me, swan" one. Sandler is good, and there is a sterling support cast, Bradley Whitford faring best. In conclusion, a dumb but entertaining movie. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    almost bald,ugly,gay,unqualified and a principal.. Qualified and super hot but still a 3rd grade teacher.. Billy Maddison is a movie that deals with a harsh reality,that movies with no real plot lines are superhits... Really good movie with some quotable dialogs and Adam Sandler is funny as always... A joke or two about his weirdly shapped head and the hillariousness is a guaranteed in Adam Sandler movies.. But still after its good moments begins to be just dragging through to takeup some footage.. Despite the flaws and stuff..It was commercially successful and part of the name of Sandler's company "Happy Madison" Named after 2 hits Happy Gilmore and Billy Madison..

    The nineties were kind to Adam Sandler, what with his Saturday Night Live career taking off to new heights and movie deals coming left and right. Many say it was the best time of his career for comedies. If I didn't know any better, I'd think it would've been his worst. And here I am, where I usually wind up after rewatching an Adam Sandler movie; appalled and dismayed. Billy Madison is a wretched, unpleasant comedy exercise from the beginning, with Sandler playing yet another rendition of the hopelessly unlikable schlub. Call them "stupid movies," call them "turn your brain off films," I call these kinds of films, "anti-character studies," when we're given a character who doesn't even try to be remotely likable and one simply not worth studying. Sandler plays the title character and we open on the desperately unfunny note of Sandler lounging in his pool, spraying sunblock on his stomach, and eagerly anticipating the arrival of his "nudie magazines" in the mail. Upon driving his go-kart to the mailbox, we see Billy is quite drunk and hallucinates a large penguin that he begins to chase through his yard. As you can infer, Sandler's character is a lame-brained, overgrown child also equipped with one of the most annoying, insufferable accents of his career (second to only The Waterboy). Billy's life is made; he doesn't need to work because his father is filthy rich and he is permitted to act like a senseless buffoon as long as he doesn't interfere with his father's line of work. But when he does, his dad reveals to Billy that he will not be handing over the company to his son but to a fellow employee because he views his son as unfit and incompetent. He too reveals that he paid all of Billy's teachers, from first to twelfth grade, to pass him no questions asked. Billy proposes that if he were to go back and repeat every grade for two weeks each, and pass with a test, that he could be given ownership of the company. His father accepts and so unfolds a comedy of dead ends. Some people will be in tears watching Sandler's character yell, scream, and fight as he repeats every grade and some will even list it as one of their favorite films. Not me. I chuckled once and fell into a dreary, never-ending silence for the remainder of the picture. It takes more than stale sight gags, a childish character, and a ridiculous accent for me to laugh. Immaturity seems to be running ramped in comedies today, and when handled delicately, with heart and wit, it can be quite funny and sometimes quite entertaining. Here, it's so dumbed-down, cloyingly idiotic, and jaw-droppingly childish that any expectations are crushed upon arrival.
