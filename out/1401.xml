    I saw this movie today on DVD and was mesmerized. Jeremy Irons portrayal of a man lost in love tore me apart. While the narrative seem incredulous so as to be a fairy tale, I found out on the internet that its based on a true story and events similar to what was depicted did happen. It makes the tale even more tragic. The cinematography of the movie is dark, still - reflective of the forbidden love between the French diplomat and the Chinese opera singer. The screenplay is fabulous. There is love in the time of war, espionage, politics and change happening constantly. The writers focus less on the events and more on the characters - lacing the actors' every action with meaning and symbolism. Politics are there to define the era and changing times, but no sides are taken. The dialog is intelligent with sentences about daily life that would normally feel stilted in real life. But Jeremey Irons and John Lone do full justice to the strange material - not only injecting believability in the script but transporting us all to the house of the tortured opera singer where love and sin become intertwined. I do not understand why the movie and its actors and director did not get any nominations let alone an Oscar. Towards the end the movie does face some merciless editing which creates unanswered questions - probably to contain the length. However the last scene is so poignant, it left me heartbroken. I have not seen a more powerful portrayal of forbidden love and loss in a long time.

    I remember when M. Butterfly was released in Brazil, back in 1993. I was just 13 years old then, but already loved Cronenberg films. The Crying Game had come out a year earlier, to much critical acclaim and financial success. M. Butterfly was thematically similar, but slightly better than Neil Jordan's movie. What it unfortunately wasn't is as financially successful. I must say that what kept audiences away wasn't Cronenberg's fault, but maybe a wrong perception of the picture. The film relied heavily on "the twist". In this particular case, on the fact that Irons' "butterfly" was, in fact, a man, which should be this big secret, to be revealed at the last half hour. It was a lost cause, a twist the heads at Warner Bros. couldn't back up: one would simply need to take a look at the poster and find the John Lone name right next to Jeremy Irons, to guess where this story is heading. The thing is, "butterfly's" sexuality wasn't important to this story, as much as people tend to think so. We know that in the real case the film was based on, the Rene Gallimard person was a bisexual man, which is very telling. My take is, there was a part of him, throughout all those years, that knew that his "butterfly" was a man. He chose to live the illusion, to blind himself from the truth, and it was perfect while it lasted. A moment that underlines this assumption is when John Lone enters the courtroom. The look Irons gives to him, he isn't surprised or devastated. He gives a knowing smile. Once the fantasy slips away with the woman's costume, it's over for Rene and Song Liling. I believe that M. Butterfly should not be taken as a movie with a twist, because there is none, the truth is right at our faces the whole time, but as a gripping, highly magnetic character study, a look into obsession, and a well-made period piece, a window of sorts to a part of the history of China we didn't really fully know. Dead Ringers remains the defining moment in David Cronenberg's career, but M. Butterfly is a great one, nonetheless, and highly recommended.

    M. BUTTERFLY continues to rank among the more important cinematic adaptations of a brilliant play - this one by the playwright David Henry Hwang. Having the pleasure to see two productions of the play - New York and Los Angeles - and viewing the film (1993) in the theater and on DVD brings an immense amount of satisfaction of just how fine this work is and continues to satisfy. The fact that David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay suggests how true to the original the film is and how much of an impact it makes on the viewer M. BUTTERFLY is based on a true story that stunned the world. During the Cultural Revolution in China in the mid-1960s, a French diplomat Ren&eacute; Gallimard (a brilliant portrayal by Jeremy Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) - women were never allowed to sing in the Beijing Opera so the fact that Song is a man is credible. Song Liling touches him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly. The love affair is so fragile and respectful that Ren&eacute; does not suspect that Song is a man in disguise. Ren&eacute; Is an important diplomat with the French Embassy, married to Jeanne (Barbara Sukowa), and is responsible for maintaining the high standards of diplomacy. Song Liling has been placed in the position of an undercover agent to gather secrets from the Embassy about the American plans in Vietnam. As Ren&eacute; is promoted he demands to see his M. Butterfly without her clothes, an Song's only protection about her gender identity is to reveal that she is pregnant with Ren&eacute;'s child and must leave to be with her family until the child is born. As the Cultural Revolution heightens the French Embassy is to be diminished and it is discovered that Ren&eacute; has been in a liaison with with a Chinese spy and is sent back to France to be imprisoned. When he is put on trial Song appears in Paris to be placed on the witness stand and since years have passed since their last meeting, Song attempts to offer herself once again to be Ren&eacute;'s Butterfly. Whether or not Ren&eacute;'s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life. Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress--as well as his jailer. In a desperately touching final scene we see the imprisoned Ren&eacute; perform the final act from the opera that has accompanied this film - Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY. The story is at once compelling, explosive and slyly humorous, 'a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.' The musical score by Howard Shore integrates arias and choruses from Puccini's opera with music from Chinese opera and his own sensuously beautiful original musical score. David Cronenberg directs with the tight amount of surreal disbelief the piece needs, but it is the brilliant acting of Jeremy Irons and John Lone that illuminate this film. It is a masterwork.

    This is a more richly woven Naked Lunch to my mind, a study on the efforts to discern truth from the makings of fantasy. In terms of Japanese film, it is what Mizoguchi was trying to posit in his later films about cultivated images obscuring a tortured heart, and which fueled at the time a second idyll with Oriental culture. The first was the time when Madame Butterfly was written, with Japanese perspectives for the first time pouring across Europe. The film is patterned around this, the Madame Butterfly opera about a geisha falling madly in love with a Westerner who is unworthy of that love, and the violent repercussions on both ends of a growing obsession. And real life mirrored from this with sexuality inversed, the events of an actual case that may be the weirdest in world espionage. Both are layered here, fiction and life. On one hand it is about the Westerner's efforts, recast here as a French diplomat in 60's Beijing, at first condescending, cynical but gradually admiring, to capture the heart of a strange exotic world. That world seduces him with the face of a Chinese opera singer, herself a Butterfly performing the opera when we first see her, exuding all those things the idealized image of the Orient is meant to: ancient mystery, scented allure, covert eroticism. (of course we know that the Madame Butterfly opera was based on a story in turn based on recollections of the writer's wife from her visit in Japan. It is a purely Methodist dream of the Orient, itself a prosthetic hybrid, an illusion. There was never any inside truth in the adopted images, any truly Oriental heart to be captured) From her end, we learn that she is manipulating that image from inside, presenting what he wishes to see to gain actual knowledge of Western machinations. But of course, this being patterned after an opera, it is about the music, not the story. So all the lachrymose love stuff makes sense, that may seem overt and heavyhanded at first glance. The flowery visuals, arranged in decorative beauty. The complete artifice of a stagebound China, that only furthers the connection with a staged reality. The project was originally meant for Peter Weir, no doubt he would have envisioned a better density for this world, a more enveloping alienation from the encounter; but the material suits Cronenberg's prosthetic worldview just fine. More than fine. The idea is that everything groomed to look beautitul should be revealed deceptive, illusionary. So he creates a natural copy of everything that should have rung true and lived, based on the idea that as an audience we are as open and eager to be seduced by images as the protagonist is. It works just subtly enough to throw us for a loop as just another Oscar bait about love and political intrigue. It is not, with all the emotional outpour that we experience as the film perversed as the instruments of a cruel deception. With victims us who genuinely believed in it. Of course what the man thinks he has learned from her was all lies, all because he failed to see truly; this is recast as a political comment with him feeding estimations about the Vietnam war to his superiors, all wrong. And a second political comment, again as pertaining to a Western dream; young leftist students rioting back in France in the name of Mao and the Cultural Revolution. We know how that panned out, what suffering was concealed in the idealized image broadcast abroad. It ends with a purely operatic transformation that is Cronenberg's turf, set up on a stage before an audience. Full circle with another Butterfly performing a role, but this one funneling broken soul into the thing. Everything is questioned, identity, contact, even sex. The result elicits a shock that is real, it's quite wonderful to watch. Overall it is near masterful stuff for me, about the power of images to seduce and break. I could see something like this come from Peter Greenaway, with the whole thing in quotation marks. But Cronenberg was daft or smart enough, I can't tell which, to make the maudlin and wooden stuff so unassuming it works deeper than Greenaway would allow. So it's not really a conventional love story but only dealt with in those terms. The opera that he's watching around him. So a man falling in love with an idealized depiction of beauty, itself a cinematic essence, but that we have to deal with as viewers on our own. Do we open up to it only to be hurt when he is? Do we keep our distance and admire aesthetically?

    "Only a man knows how a woman should act." - Song Liling David Croneberg's "M. Butterfly" stars Jeremy Irons as Rene Gallimard, a French diplomat who falls in love with Song Liling, a Chinese spy and opera performer. Rene may or may not be gay and may or may not know that Song, who also may or may not be gay, is a man rather than a woman. Song stars in "Madame Butterfly", an opera about illusory love. Within the opera, Song plays a woman. Outside the opera, Song deliberately acts "feminine" - whereby "femininity" is understood as a series of calculated signs rather than anything intrinsic - in order to get close to Rene. Once he realises that Song is male, Rene morphs into a woman. Rene's name conjures up philosopher Rene Descartes' mind/body schism. The film's title echoes another of Cronenberg's metamorphosis movies, "The Fly". Descartes formulated a now famous dualist speculation of the mind in his "Meditations on First Philosophy". This is where he presented what would become the "mind-body problem", the idea that the body and mind, or flesh and spirit, exist as distinct substances. Descartes reasoned that one's thoughts, guided by reason and rationality, identify them as a person, and that one exists only so long as one's thoughts exist. Bodies, in contrast, are merely an extended, mechanical composition governed by the physical laws of nature. For Descartes, the mind could and should not be understood in the same terms as the body. Today Cartesian dualism has either been refuted or completely redefined, though what is known as the "hard problem" (of the mind, body and consciousness) remains unsolved. Lines of thought tend to run either toward monism or dualism, both of which have subsets like interactionism, parallelism, occasionalism, materialism, behaviourism, functionalism, or epiphenomenalism, the latter stating that the brain simply causes mental events as a neurological by-product, and that mental events cannot cause behaviour. Some of these branches suggest that there is no mind, others posit that the mind is controlled by nature and has no or limited free will. Today discussions are drifting toward a form of Quantum mysticism. Regardless, for Cronenberg the body is an amalgamation of both feminine and masculine qualities, the mind does not exist as traditionally thought and identities are engineered, synthesised and collapsible. Unlike Descartes, existence for Cronenberg requires both a mental configuration and a biological configuration; a multiplicity of self-identification in which identity and identity formation are cyclical, fluid and variable. Where Descartes attempts to arrive at a solid, stable point, Cronenberg posits identity as evolving without any preordained certainty, shows the importance of the outside in defining the Self, and distrusts the notion that we can arrive at any certainty, fixedness, or place beyond change. In a sense, the Rene character parodies Descartes. What he is is not quite in his hands. Descartes also formulated a "Separation Thesis", in which the body is essentially shown to have less value than the mind. This has given rise to a certain aversion to the body, and a bevy of tales in which man neurotically attempts to "transcend his icky, primitive flesh". This, of course, echoes Cronenberg's "body horror" movies. In Cronenberg's "The Fly", for example, Seth Brundle's "mind" develops an aversion  a battle which the intellect always loses as it surrenders to madness - to a wild, unresponsive, conspiratorial, rebellious body which dares confront the autonomy of the "mind". Rather than the "mind" triumphing over matter, Brundle is consumed by flesh and becomes a bundle of human, animal and machine by the film's end, having been unable to achieve a comfortable synthesis of intellect, emotion and technology. But while "The Fly" shows the "mind" overpowered by flesh, Brundle's perceived loss of autonomy generating a sort of grotesque, monstrous form of self hate, "Butterfly's" hero explicitly desires his transformation. Rene's disconnect between Mind/Gender (I am a woman!) and Body/Sex (But I'm male!) results in Rene actively desiring a transformed body to live in, rather than the Existenz-like simulation he created to sustain his prior delusions. End result: it is multiplicity (consciousness, body, inside, outside, nervous system, DNA, flesh etc) which results in causation, the "mind" does not exist as a single entity, and the psyche and the soma are combinations of the shared experiences arising from innumerable interactions. Metamorphoses occur in other Cronenberg flicks, most of which show how a revulsion toward corporeality pushes men toward technology. Technology then becomes the physical expression, the dream, of the body as it writes its desires on social life. Much of this echoes the filmography of Kubrick; think man's "transcendental journey" in "2001", in which mankind forever points to but never reaches a technologically sleek monolith, attaining instead fleshy corporeality, and the mind/body splits of "Full Metal Jacket", in which both the military and a dissenting marine rigidly attempt to manufacture gender roles and demarcations between head and body. Both directors show how accepted social binaries are but symptoms of Western culture and how first person phenomenal experience outside discursive contexts is but a liberal humanist delusion of self (liberal humanism proposes that the subject is the free, unconstrained author of meaning and action, the origin of history etc). Incidentally, "M. Butterfly" - oft dubbed "the ultimate postmodern, post-structuralist play" - was originally a stage-play by David Hwang. Hwang's play, like "Full Metal Jacket" (itself a cocoonish, butterflyish title), was about how empires construct identity (West/masculine, Other/East/feminine), about Patriarchy as the basis for imperial conquest, colonial discourse, and hierarchical definitions of geopolitics, ethnicity, gender, and race. In the play, binaries are shattered as Rene's role as spectator/audience/masculine/west is reversed by the duplicitous Song. It is then Rene who becomes the Butterfly (effeminate/object/fcked), duped by love. Cronenberg's film is less interested in these broader issues. 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    In 1960s China, French diplomat Rene Gallimard (Jeremy Irons) falls in love with an opera singer, Song Liling (J. Lone) -- but Song is not at all who Gallimard thinks. I liked when Song Liling said, "It's one of your favorite fantasies, isn't it? The submissive Oriental woman and the cruel white man." She put the story of Madame Butterfly in its place, and then in the much larger context of the Vietnam war that was about to erupt. I do not wish to make any political remarks, but this film was layered very well -- the Madam Butterfly aspect had at least three parallels. Jeremy Irons is excellent, and it is nice to see him reuniting with Cronenberg. This does not have the "science" of Cronenberg, the "flesh" aspect, but as he says in a feature on the DVD, he leans towards odd communities as a filmmaker. And truly, there are some odd people here... is Song in love with Gallimard or just playing him? What is her secret? I loved the multiple twists and how smoothly they were revealed. Roger Ebert sees the big twist as obvious from the start, but I think this might be because he cheated. I have to agree with him on this comment, though: "Irons bases his performance on the understanding that erotic impulses are always completely humorless to those who hold them, even though they might seem hilarious to the observer." That, and Irons naturally has a very humorless persona -- even when he jokes, he is all too serious. I never saw the original play or read it, so I cannot make any educated comparisons to source material. But the film is great, and while not one of Cronenberg's better known films, still a must-see. Just so weird in a non-weird way.

    Even directors as acclaimed as David Cronenberg have to have some duds in their filmography. Enter M. Butterfly, the odd and empty story of a French civil servant agent who falls in love with an opera singer while working in Beijing. It is set during the cultural revolution of 1960's China as tensions rise due to uncontrollable issues. But the real problems stem from the relationship between Rene Gallimard and his lover, Song Liling, which takes an unforeseen turn when you least expect it. This is just one of those films that is flat, dull, unconvincing, and just downright bland. So little happens for the first half of the film and what does happen is an uninteresting and unengaging romance that unfolds at an awkward pace with no real emotion or motivation behind it. This is a story that demands a lot of passion and emotion behind it in order to be truly compelling. The film falls flat here and never managed to keep my interest. The story here isn't terrible. It is based on a true story and that always adds a different element of intrigue, but the execution of this story is very poor. It could have been incredible, but I simply found nothing interesting here, at least for the first half. After a while I asked myself just why Cronenberg directed a sappy foreign country romance like this. Then a very specific and completely unexpected element was introduced and I quickly found myself saying, "Aha. That's why Cronenberg directed this." The conclusion of this film is sudden and unfolds too quickly to have any real emotional force behind it. By this point in the film my interest in these characters and events had flat lined so I was only appalled and irritated by the direction this film had gone. There isn't a much easier way to put it other than it is simply not good and not fun. It was quite the disappointment to see a lot of potential go to waste. I started out disliking this film and by the end I didn't like it any more than I had before, but I wanted it to be so much better and I longed for it to be more emotionally engaging in order to achieve the full affect which this story has the potential to do. But it just simply fell flat. It is evident that Cronenberg put some effort into this film but just missed the mark and managed to produce a dull and painfully uninteresting story out of something that could have been extremely intriguing. M. Butterfly is something different, but not really worth the watch.

    Or, conversely, love doesn't know the gender it loves. Jeremy Irons and John Lone star in "M. Butterfly," based on the hit play by David Henry Hwang. In the mid-'60s, while the cultural revolution is going on in China, French Vice Consul Phillipe Bouriscot (Irons) falls in love with a singer, Song (John Lone), who performs with the Bejing opera. He believes Song to be a woman. And, like the story of "Madame Butterfly," there is love, there is betrayal, and there is humiliation. As unbelievable as this story might be, it's based on a true one. The film doesn't go into how this fantasy was actually executed physically, but in point of fact, in real life, the character played by Irons believed he had gotten Song pregnant. Odd but true. David Cronenberg does an excellent job with this dark, mysterious film, and the actors are terrific, each character hooked on this fantasy in his own way. The end of the film is haunting. Well worth seeing.

    The first time i saw M.Butterfly i thought it is not a typical Cronenberg's movie. The second time, i saw i feel like it's definitely a Cronenberg movie, not about the body deformations but about the emotional deformations. Especially the scene which was shot in the police van, was one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen. It is such a good movie about love and obsession. There are not enough words to describe the performance of Jeremy Irons and John Lone. It is a MUST SEE!! not just for Cronenberg fans but also for every people who appreciate a good movie. Just take a deep breath before you watch it and be sure that you can handle it.

    This film was awful in ways that I have never experienced before. The photography is so cheesy, the sets are totally unconvincing, direction and performances are empty, it deals with big events in an amateur theatrical way, the script is boring, the storytelling is dire, the music is incessantly irritating, the Great Wall of China becomes a joke, the only believable location is Paris, because it's the only real location! The whole thing is creepy, an when the 'twist' is revealed it just gets creepier. There are even some good actors in the cast, so hat's off to David Cronenberg for the worst film I ever endured. I hate to think I suffered in vain, please don't watch this film!

During the Cultural Revolution in China in the mid-1960s, a French diplomat Ren&eacute; Gallimard (a brilliant portrayal by Jeremy Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) - women were never allowed to sing in the Beijing Opera so the fact that Song is a man is credible. Song Liling touches him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly. The love affair is so fragile and respectful that Ren&eacute; does not suspect that Song is a man in disguise. Ren&eacute; Is an important diplomat with the French Embassy, married to Jeanne (Barbara Sukowa), and is responsible for maintaining the high standards of diplomacy. Song Liling has been placed in the position of an undercover agent to gather secrets from the Embassy about the American plans in Vietnam. As Ren&eacute; is promoted he demands to see his M. Butterfly without her clothes, an Song's only protection about her gender identity is to reveal that she is pregnant with Ren&eacute;'s child and must leave to be with her family until the child is born. As the Cultural Revolution heightens the French Embassy is to be diminished and it is discovered that Ren&eacute; has been in a liaison with with a Chinese spy and is sent back to France to be imprisoned. When he is put on trial Song appears in Paris to be placed on the witness stand and since years have passed since their last meeting, Song attempts to offer herself once again to be Ren&eacute;'s Butterfly. Whether or not Ren&eacute;'s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life. Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress--as well as his jailer. In a desperately touching final scene we see the imprisoned Ren&eacute; perform the final act from the opera that has accompanied this film - Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY. The story is at once compelling, explosive and slyly humorous, 'a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.' The musical score by Howard Shore integrates arias and choruses from Puccini's opera with music from Chinese opera and his own sensuously beautiful original musical score. David Cronenberg directs with the tight amount of surreal disbelief the piece needs, but it is the brilliant acting of Jeremy Irons and John Lone that illuminate this film. It is a masterwork.

    This is a more richly woven Naked Lunch to my mind, a study on the efforts to discern truth from the makings of fantasy. In terms of Japanese film, it is what Mizoguchi was trying to posit in his later films about cultivated images obscuring a tortured heart, and which fueled at the time a second idyll with Oriental culture. The first was the time when Madame Butterfly was written, with Japanese perspectives for the first time pouring across Europe. The film is patterned around this, the Madame Butterfly opera about a geisha falling madly in love with a Westerner who is unworthy of that love, and the violent repercussions on both ends of a growing obsession. And real life mirrored from this with sexuality inversed, the events of an actual case that may be the weirdest in world espionage. Both are layered here, fiction and life. On one hand it is about the Westerner's efforts, recast here as a French diplomat in 60's Beijing, at first condescending, cynical but gradually admiring, to capture the heart of a strange exotic world. That world seduces him with the face of a Chinese opera singer, herself a Butterfly performing the opera when we first see her, exuding all those things the idealized image of the Orient is meant to: ancient mystery, scented allure, covert eroticism. (of course we know that the Madame Butterfly opera was based on a story in turn based on recollections of the writer's wife from her visit in Japan. It is a purely Methodist dream of the Orient, itself a prosthetic hybrid, an illusion. There was never any inside truth in the adopted images, any truly Oriental heart to be captured) From her end, we learn that she is manipulating that image from inside, presenting what he wishes to see to gain actual knowledge of Western machinations. But of course, this being patterned after an opera, it is about the music, not the story. So all the lachrymose love stuff makes sense, that may seem overt and heavyhanded at first glance. The flowery visuals, arranged in decorative beauty. The complete artifice of a stagebound China, that only furthers the connection with a staged reality. The project was originally meant for Peter Weir, no doubt he would have envisioned a better density for this world, a more enveloping alienation from the encounter; but the material suits Cronenberg's prosthetic worldview just fine. More than fine. The idea is that everything groomed to look beautitul should be revealed deceptive, illusionary. So he creates a natural copy of everything that should have rung true and lived, based on the idea that as an audience we are as open and eager to be seduced by images as the protagonist is. It works just subtly enough to throw us for a loop as just another Oscar bait about love and political intrigue. It is not, with all the emotional outpour that we experience as the film perversed as the instruments of a cruel deception. With victims us who genuinely believed in it. Of course what the man thinks he has learned from her was all lies, all because he failed to see truly; this is recast as a political comment with him feeding estimations about the Vietnam war to his superiors, all wrong. And a second political comment, again as pertaining to a Western dream; young leftist students rioting back in France in the name of Mao and the Cultural Revolution. We know how that panned out, what suffering was concealed in the idealized image broadcast abroad. It ends with a purely operatic transformation that is Cronenberg's turf, set up on a stage before an audience. Full circle with another Butterfly performing a role, but this one funneling broken soul into the thing. Everything is questioned, identity, contact, even sex. The result elicits a shock that is real, it's quite wonderful to watch. Overall it is near masterful stuff for me, about the power of images to seduce and break. I could see something like this come from Peter Greenaway, with the whole thing in quotation marks. But Cronenberg was daft or smart enough, I can't tell which, to make the maudlin and wooden stuff so unassuming it works deeper than Greenaway would allow. So it's not really a conventional love story but only dealt with in those terms. The opera that he's watching around him. So a man falling in love with an idealized depiction of beauty, itself a cinematic essence, but that we have to deal with as viewers on our own. Do we open up to it only to be hurt when he is? Do we keep our distance and admire aesthetically?

    "Only a man knows how a woman should act." - Song Liling David Croneberg's "M. Butterfly" stars Jeremy Irons as Rene Gallimard, a French diplomat who falls in love with Song Liling, a Chinese spy and opera performer. Rene may or may not be gay and may or may not know that Song, who also may or may not be gay, is a man rather than a woman. Song stars in "Madame Butterfly", an opera about illusory love. Within the opera, Song plays a woman. Outside the opera, Song deliberately acts "feminine" - whereby "femininity" is understood as a series of calculated signs rather than anything intrinsic - in order to get close to Rene. Once he realises that Song is male, Rene morphs into a woman. Rene's name conjures up philosopher Rene Descartes' mind/body schism. The film's title echoes another of Cronenberg's metamorphosis movies, "The Fly". Descartes formulated a now famous dualist speculation of the mind in his "Meditations on First Philosophy". This is where he presented what would become the "mind-body problem", the idea that the body and mind, or flesh and spirit, exist as distinct substances. Descartes reasoned that one's thoughts, guided by reason and rationality, identify them as a person, and that one exists only so long as one's thoughts exist. Bodies, in contrast, are merely an extended, mechanical composition governed by the physical laws of nature. For Descartes, the mind could and should not be understood in the same terms as the body. Today Cartesian dualism has either been refuted or completely redefined, though what is known as the "hard problem" (of the mind, body and consciousness) remains unsolved. Lines of thought tend to run either toward monism or dualism, both of which have subsets like interactionism, parallelism, occasionalism, materialism, behaviourism, functionalism, or epiphenomenalism, the latter stating that the brain simply causes mental events as a neurological by-product, and that mental events cannot cause behaviour. Some of these branches suggest that there is no mind, others posit that the mind is controlled by nature and has no or limited free will. Today discussions are drifting toward a form of Quantum mysticism. Regardless, for Cronenberg the body is an amalgamation of both feminine and masculine qualities, the mind does not exist as traditionally thought and identities are engineered, synthesised and collapsible. Unlike Descartes, existence for Cronenberg requires both a mental configuration and a biological configuration; a multiplicity of self-identification in which identity and identity formation are cyclical, fluid and variable. Where Descartes attempts to arrive at a solid, stable point, Cronenberg posits identity as evolving without any preordained certainty, shows the importance of the outside in defining the Self, and distrusts the notion that we can arrive at any certainty, fixedness, or place beyond change. In a sense, the Rene character parodies Descartes. What he is is not quite in his hands. Descartes also formulated a "Separation Thesis", in which the body is essentially shown to have less value than the mind. This has given rise to a certain aversion to the body, and a bevy of tales in which man neurotically attempts to "transcend his icky, primitive flesh". This, of course, echoes Cronenberg's "body horror" movies. In Cronenberg's "The Fly", for example, Seth Brundle's "mind" develops an aversion  a battle which the intellect always loses as it surrenders to madness - to a wild, unresponsive, conspiratorial, rebellious body which dares confront the autonomy of the "mind". Rather than the "mind" triumphing over matter, Brundle is consumed by flesh and becomes a bundle of human, animal and machine by the film's end, having been unable to achieve a comfortable synthesis of intellect, emotion and technology. But while "The Fly" shows the "mind" overpowered by flesh, Brundle's perceived loss of autonomy generating a sort of grotesque, monstrous form of self hate, "Butterfly's" hero explicitly desires his transformation. Rene's disconnect between Mind/Gender (I am a woman!) and Body/Sex (But I'm male!) results in Rene actively desiring a transformed body to live in, rather than the Existenz-like simulation he created to sustain his prior delusions. End result: it is multiplicity (consciousness, body, inside, outside, nervous system, DNA, flesh etc) which results in causation, the "mind" does not exist as a single entity, and the psyche and the soma are combinations of the shared experiences arising from innumerable interactions. Metamorphoses occur in other Cronenberg flicks, most of which show how a revulsion toward corporeality pushes men toward technology. Technology then becomes the physical expression, the dream, of the body as it writes its desires on social life. Much of this echoes the filmography of Kubrick; think man's "transcendental journey" in "2001", in which mankind forever points to but never reaches a technologically sleek monolith, attaining instead fleshy corporeality, and the mind/body splits of "Full Metal Jacket", in which both the military and a dissenting marine rigidly attempt to manufacture gender roles and demarcations between head and body. Both directors show how accepted social binaries are but symptoms of Western culture and how first person phenomenal experience outside discursive contexts is but a liberal humanist delusion of self (liberal humanism proposes that the subject is the free, unconstrained author of meaning and action, the origin of history etc). Incidentally, "M. Butterfly" - oft dubbed "the ultimate postmodern, post-structuralist play" - was originally a stage-play by David Hwang. Hwang's play, like "Full Metal Jacket" (itself a cocoonish, butterflyish title), was about how empires construct identity (West/masculine, Other/East/feminine), about Patriarchy as the basis for imperial conquest, colonial discourse, and hierarchical definitions of geopolitics, ethnicity, gender, and race. In the play, binaries are shattered as Rene's role as spectator/audience/masculine/west is reversed by the duplicitous Song. It is then Rene who becomes the Butterfly (effeminate/object/fcked), duped by love. Cronenberg's film is less interested in these broader issues. 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    In 1960s China, French diplomat Rene Gallimard (Jeremy Irons) falls in love with an opera singer, Song Liling (J. Lone) -- but Song is not at all who Gallimard thinks. I liked when Song Liling said, "It's one of your favorite fantasies, isn't it? The submissive Oriental woman and the cruel white man." She put the story of Madame Butterfly in its place, and then in the much larger context of the Vietnam war that was about to erupt. I do not wish to make any political remarks, but this film was layered very well -- the Madam Butterfly aspect had at least three parallels. Jeremy Irons is excellent, and it is nice to see him reuniting with Cronenberg. This does not have the "science" of Cronenberg, the "flesh" aspect, but as he says in a feature on the DVD, he leans towards odd communities as a filmmaker. And truly, there are some odd people here... is Song in love with Gallimard or just playing him? What is her secret? I loved the multiple twists and how smoothly they were revealed. Roger Ebert sees the big twist as obvious from the start, but I think this might be because he cheated. I have to agree with him on this comment, though: "Irons bases his performance on the understanding that erotic impulses are always completely humorless to those who hold them, even though they might seem hilarious to the observer." That, and Irons naturally has a very humorless persona -- even when he jokes, he is all too serious. I never saw the original play or read it, so I cannot make any educated comparisons to source material. But the film is great, and while not one of Cronenberg's better known films, still a must-see. Just so weird in a non-weird way.

    Even directors as acclaimed as David Cronenberg have to have some duds in their filmography. Enter M. Butterfly, the odd and empty story of a French civil servant agent who falls in love with an opera singer while working in Beijing. It is set during the cultural revolution of 1960's China as tensions rise due to uncontrollable issues. But the real problems stem from the relationship between Rene Gallimard and his lover, Song Liling, which takes an unforeseen turn when you least expect it. This is just one of those films that is flat, dull, unconvincing, and just downright bland. So little happens for the first half of the film and what does happen is an uninteresting and unengaging romance that unfolds at an awkward pace with no real emotion or motivation behind it. This is a story that demands a lot of passion and emotion behind it in order to be truly compelling. The film falls flat here and never managed to keep my interest. The story here isn't terrible. It is based on a true story and that always adds a different element of intrigue, but the execution of this story is very poor. It could have been incredible, but I simply found nothing interesting here, at least for the first half. After a while I asked myself just why Cronenberg directed a sappy foreign country romance like this. Then a very specific and completely unexpected element was introduced and I quickly found myself saying, "Aha. That's why Cronenberg directed this." The conclusion of this film is sudden and unfolds too quickly to have any real emotional force behind it. By this point in the film my interest in these characters and events had flat lined so I was only appalled and irritated by the direction this film had gone. There isn't a much easier way to put it other than it is simply not good and not fun. It was quite the disappointment to see a lot of potential go to waste. I started out disliking this film and by the end I didn't like it any more than I had before, but I wanted it to be so much better and I longed for it to be more emotionally engaging in order to achieve the full affect which this story has the potential to do. But it just simply fell flat. It is evident that Cronenberg put some effort into this film but just missed the mark and managed to produce a dull and painfully uninteresting story out of something that could have been extremely intriguing. M. Butterfly is something different, but not really worth the watch.

    Or, conversely, love doesn't know the gender it loves. Jeremy Irons and John Lone star in "M. Butterfly," based on the hit play by David Henry Hwang. In the mid-'60s, while the cultural revolution is going on in China, French Vice Consul Phillipe Bouriscot (Irons) falls in love with a singer, Song (John Lone), who performs with the Bejing opera. He believes Song to be a woman. And, like the story of "Madame Butterfly," there is love, there is betrayal, and there is humiliation. As unbelievable as this story might be, it's based on a true one. The film doesn't go into how this fantasy was actually executed physically, but in point of fact, in real life, the character played by Irons believed he had gotten Song pregnant. Odd but true. David Cronenberg does an excellent job with this dark, mysterious film, and the actors are terrific, each character hooked on this fantasy in his own way. The end of the film is haunting. Well worth seeing.

    The first time i saw M.Butterfly i thought it is not a typical Cronenberg's movie. The second time, i saw i feel like it's definitely a Cronenberg movie, not about the body deformations but about the emotional deformations. Especially the scene which was shot in the police van, was one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen. It is such a good movie about love and obsession. There are not enough words to describe the performance of Jeremy Irons and John Lone. It is a MUST SEE!! not just for Cronenberg fans but also for every people who appreciate a good movie. Just take a deep breath before you watch it and be sure that you can handle it.

    This film was awful in ways that I have never experienced before. The photography is so cheesy, the sets are totally unconvincing, direction and performances are empty, it deals with big events in an amateur theatrical way, the script is boring, the storytelling is dire, the music is incessantly irritating, the Great Wall of China becomes a joke, the only believable location is Paris, because it's the only real location! The whole thing is creepy, an when the 'twist' is revealed it just gets creepier. There are even some good actors in the cast, so hat's off to David Cronenberg for the worst film I ever endured. I hate to think I suffered in vain, please don't watch this film!

    I saw this movie today on DVD and was mesmerized. Jeremy Irons portrayal of a man lost in love tore me apart. While the narrative seem incredulous so as to be a fairy tale, I found out on the internet that its based on a true story and events similar to what was depicted did happen. It makes the tale even more tragic. The cinematography of the movie is dark, still - reflective of the forbidden love between the French diplomat and the Chinese opera singer. The screenplay is fabulous. There is love in the time of war, espionage, politics and change happening constantly. The writers focus less on the events and more on the characters - lacing the actors' every action with meaning and symbolism. Politics are there to define the era and changing times, but no sides are taken. The dialog is intelligent with sentences about daily life that would normally feel stilted in real life. But Jeremey Irons and John Lone do full justice to the strange material - not only injecting believability in the script but transporting us all to the house of the tortured opera singer where love and sin become intertwined. I do not understand why the movie and its actors and director did not get any nominations let alone an Oscar. Towards the end the movie does face some merciless editing which creates unanswered questions - probably to contain the length. However the last scene is so poignant, it left me heartbroken. I have not seen a more powerful portrayal of forbidden love and loss in a long time.

    I remember when M. Butterfly was released in Brazil, back in 1993. I was just 13 years old then, but already loved Cronenberg films. The Crying Game had come out a year earlier, to much critical acclaim and financial success. M. Butterfly was thematically similar, but slightly better than Neil Jordan's movie. What it unfortunately wasn't is as financially successful. I must say that what kept audiences away wasn't Cronenberg's fault, but maybe a wrong perception of the picture. The film relied heavily on "the twist". In this particular case, on the fact that Irons' "butterfly" was, in fact, a man, which should be this big secret, to be revealed at the last half hour. It was a lost cause, a twist the heads at Warner Bros. couldn't back up: one would simply need to take a look at the poster and find the John Lone name right next to Jeremy Irons, to guess where this story is heading. The thing is, "butterfly's" sexuality wasn't important to this story, as much as people tend to think so. We know that in the real case the film was based on, the Rene Gallimard person was a bisexual man, which is very telling. My take is, there was a part of him, throughout all those years, that knew that his "butterfly" was a man. He chose to live the illusion, to blind himself from the truth, and it was perfect while it lasted. A moment that underlines this assumption is when John Lone enters the courtroom. The look Irons gives to him, he isn't surprised or devastated. He gives a knowing smile. Once the fantasy slips away with the woman's costume, it's over for Rene and Song Liling. I believe that M. Butterfly should not be taken as a movie with a twist, because there is none, the truth is right at our faces the whole time, but as a gripping, highly magnetic character study, a look into obsession, and a well-made period piece, a window of sorts to a part of the history of China we didn't really fully know. Dead Ringers remains the defining moment in David Cronenberg's career, but M. Butterfly is a great one, nonetheless, and highly recommended.

    M. BUTTERFLY continues to rank among the more important cinematic adaptations of a brilliant play - this one by the playwright David Henry Hwang. Having the pleasure to see two productions of the play - New York and Los Angeles - and viewing the film (1993) in the theater and on DVD brings an immense amount of satisfaction of just how fine this work is and continues to satisfy. The fact that David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay suggests how true to the original the film is and how much of an impact it makes on the viewer M. BUTTERFLY is based on a true story that stunned the world. During the Cultural Revolution in China in the mid-1960s, a French diplomat Ren&eacute; Gallimard (a brilliant portrayal by Jeremy Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) - women were never allowed to sing in the Beijing Opera so the fact that Song is a man is credible. Song Liling touches him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly. The love affair is so fragile and respectful that Ren&eacute; does not suspect that Song is a man in disguise. Ren&eacute; Is an important diplomat with the French Embassy, married to Jeanne (Barbara Sukowa), and is responsible for maintaining the high standards of diplomacy. Song Liling has been placed in the position of an undercover agent to gather secrets from the Embassy about the American plans in Vietnam. As Ren&eacute; is promoted he demands to see his M. Butterfly without her clothes, an Song's only protection about her gender identity is to reveal that she is pregnant with Ren&eacute;'s child and must leave to be with her family until the child is born. As the Cultural Revolution heightens the French Embassy is to be diminished and it is discovered that Ren&eacute; has been in a liaison with with a Chinese spy and is sent back to France to be imprisoned. When he is put on trial Song appears in Paris to be placed on the witness stand and since years have passed since their last meeting, Song attempts to offer herself once again to be Ren&eacute;'s Butterfly. Whether or not Ren&eacute;'s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life. Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress--as well as his jailer.

    "Only a man knows how a woman should act." - Song Liling David Croneberg's "M. Butterfly" stars Jeremy Irons as Rene Gallimard, a French diplomat who falls in love with Song Liling, a Chinese spy and opera performer. Rene may or may not be gay and may or may not know that Song, who also may or may not be gay, is a man rather than a woman. Song stars in "Madame Butterfly", an opera about illusory love. Within the opera, Song plays a woman. Outside the opera, Song deliberately acts "feminine" - whereby "femininity" is understood as a series of calculated signs rather than anything intrinsic - in order to get close to Rene. Once he realises that Song is male, Rene morphs into a woman. Rene's name conjures up philosopher Rene Descartes' mind/body schism. The film's title echoes another of Cronenberg's metamorphosis movies, "The Fly". Descartes formulated a now famous dualist speculation of the mind in his "Meditations on First Philosophy". This is where he presented what would become the "mind-body problem", the idea that the body and mind, or flesh and spirit, exist as distinct substances. Descartes reasoned that one's thoughts, guided by reason and rationality, identify them as a person, and that one exists only so long as one's thoughts exist. Bodies, in contrast, are merely an extended, mechanical composition governed by the physical laws of nature. For Descartes, the mind could and should not be understood in the same terms as the body. Today Cartesian dualism has either been refuted or completely redefined, though what is known as the "hard problem" (of the mind, body and consciousness) remains unsolved. Lines of thought tend to run either toward monism or dualism, both of which have subsets like interactionism, parallelism, occasionalism, materialism, behaviourism, functionalism, or epiphenomenalism, the latter stating that the brain simply causes mental events as a neurological by-product, and that mental events cannot cause behaviour. Some of these branches suggest that there is no mind, others posit that the mind is controlled by nature and has no or limited free will. Today discussions are drifting toward a form of Quantum mysticism. Regardless, for Cronenberg the body is an amalgamation of both feminine and masculine qualities, the mind does not exist as traditionally thought and identities are engineered, synthesised and collapsible. Unlike Descartes, existence for Cronenberg requires both a mental configuration and a biological configuration; a multiplicity of self-identification in which identity and identity formation are cyclical, fluid and variable. Where Descartes attempts to arrive at a solid, stable point, Cronenberg posits identity as evolving without any preordained certainty, shows the importance of the outside in defining the Self, and distrusts the notion that we can arrive at any certainty, fixedness, or place beyond change. In a sense, the Rene character parodies Descartes. What he is is not quite in his hands. Descartes also formulated a "Separation Thesis", in which the body is essentially shown to have less value than the mind. This has given rise to a certain aversion to the body, and a bevy of tales in which man neurotically attempts to "transcend his icky, primitive flesh". This, of course, echoes Cronenberg's "body horror" movies. In Cronenberg's "The Fly", for example, Seth Brundle's "mind" develops an aversion  a battle which the intellect always loses as it surrenders to madness - to a wild, unresponsive, conspiratorial, rebellious body which dares confront the autonomy of the "mind". Rather than the "mind" triumphing over matter, Brundle is consumed by flesh and becomes a bundle of human, animal and machine by the film's end, having been unable to achieve a comfortable synthesis of intellect, emotion and technology. But while "The Fly" shows the "mind" overpowered by flesh, Brundle's perceived loss of autonomy generating a sort of grotesque, monstrous form of self hate, "Butterfly's" hero explicitly desires his transformation. Rene's disconnect between Mind/Gender (I am a woman!) and Body/Sex (But I'm male!) results in Rene actively desiring a transformed body to live in, rather than the Existenz-like simulation he created to sustain his prior delusions. End result: it is multiplicity (consciousness, body, inside, outside, nervous system, DNA, flesh etc) which results in causation, the "mind" does not exist as a single entity, and the psyche and the soma are combinations of the shared experiences arising from innumerable interactions. Metamorphoses occur in other Cronenberg flicks, most of which show how a revulsion toward corporeality pushes men toward technology. Technology then becomes the physical expression, the dream, of the body as it writes its desires on social life. Much of this echoes the filmography of Kubrick; think man's "transcendental journey" in "2001", in which mankind forever points to but never reaches a technologically sleek monolith, attaining instead fleshy corporeality, and the mind/body splits of "Full Metal Jacket", in which both the military and a dissenting marine rigidly attempt to manufacture gender roles and demarcations between head and body. Both directors show how accepted social binaries are but symptoms of Western culture and how first person phenomenal experience outside discursive contexts is but a liberal humanist delusion of self (liberal humanism proposes that the subject is the free, unconstrained author of meaning and action, the origin of history etc). Incidentally, "M. Butterfly" - oft dubbed "the ultimate postmodern, post-structuralist play" - was originally a stage-play by David Hwang. Hwang's play, like "Full Metal Jacket" (itself a cocoonish, butterflyish title), was about how empires construct identity (West/masculine, Other/East/feminine), about Patriarchy as the basis for imperial conquest, colonial discourse, and hierarchical definitions of geopolitics, ethnicity, gender, and race. In the play, binaries are shattered as Rene's role as spectator/audience/masculine/west is reversed by the duplicitous Song. It is then Rene who becomes the Butterfly (effeminate/object/fcked), duped by love. Cronenberg's film is less interested in these broader issues. 6/10  Worth one viewing.

    In 1960s China, French diplomat Rene Gallimard (Jeremy Irons) falls in love with an opera singer, Song Liling (J. Lone) -- but Song is not at all who Gallimard thinks. I liked when Song Liling said, "It's one of your favorite fantasies, isn't it? The submissive Oriental woman and the cruel white man." She put the story of Madame Butterfly in its place, and then in the much larger context of the Vietnam war that was about to erupt. I do not wish to make any political remarks, but this film was layered very well -- the Madam Butterfly aspect had at least three parallels. Jeremy Irons is excellent, and it is nice to see him reuniting with Cronenberg. This does not have the "science" of Cronenberg, the "flesh" aspect, but as he says in a feature on the DVD, he leans towards odd communities as a filmmaker. And truly, there are some odd people here... is Song in love with Gallimard or just playing him? What is her secret? I loved the multiple twists and how smoothly they were revealed. Roger Ebert sees the big twist as obvious from the start, but I think this might be because he cheated. I have to agree with him on this comment, though: "Irons bases his performance on the understanding that erotic impulses are always completely humorless to those who hold them, even though they might seem hilarious to the observer." That, and Irons naturally has a very humorless persona -- even when he jokes, he is all too serious. I never saw the original play or read it, so I cannot make any educated comparisons to source material. But the film is great, and while not one of Cronenberg's better known films, still a must-see. Just so weird in a non-weird way.

    Even directors as acclaimed as David Cronenberg have to have some duds in their filmography. Enter M. Butterfly, the odd and empty story of a French civil servant agent who falls in love with an opera singer while working in Beijing. It is set during the cultural revolution of 1960's China as tensions rise due to uncontrollable issues. But the real problems stem from the relationship between Rene Gallimard and his lover, Song Liling, which takes an unforeseen turn when you least expect it. This is just one of those films that is flat, dull, unconvincing, and just downright bland. So little happens for the first half of the film and what does happen is an uninteresting and unengaging romance that unfolds at an awkward pace with no real emotion or motivation behind it. This is a story that demands a lot of passion and emotion behind it in order to be truly compelling. The film falls flat here and never managed to keep my interest. The story here isn't terrible. It is based on a true story and that always adds a different element of intrigue, but the execution of this story is very poor. It could have been incredible, but I simply found nothing interesting here, at least for the first half. After a while I asked myself just why Cronenberg directed a sappy foreign country romance like this. Then a very specific and completely unexpected element was introduced and I quickly found myself saying, "Aha. That's why Cronenberg directed this." The conclusion of this film is sudden and unfolds too quickly to have any real emotional force behind it. By this point in the film my interest in these characters and events had flat lined so I was only appalled and irritated by the direction this film had gone. There isn't a much easier way to put it other than it is simply not good and not fun. It was quite the disappointment to see a lot of potential go to waste. I started out disliking this film and by the end I didn't like it any more than I had before, but I wanted it to be so much better and I longed for it to be more emotionally engaging in order to achieve the full affect which this story has the potential to do. But it just simply fell flat. It is evident that Cronenberg put some effort into this film but just missed the mark and managed to produce a dull and painfully uninteresting story out of something that could have been extremely intriguing. M. Butterfly is something different, but not really worth the watch.

    Or, conversely, love doesn't know the gender it loves. Jeremy Irons and John Lone star in "M. Butterfly," based on the hit play by David Henry Hwang. In the mid-'60s, while the cultural revolution is going on in China, French Vice Consul Phillipe Bouriscot (Irons) falls in love with a singer, Song (John Lone), who performs with the Bejing opera. He believes Song to be a woman. And, like the story of "Madame Butterfly," there is love, there is betrayal, and there is humiliation. As unbelievable as this story might be, it's based on a true one. The film doesn't go into how this fantasy was actually executed physically, but in point of fact, in real life, the character played by Irons believed he had gotten Song pregnant. Odd but true. David Cronenberg does an excellent job with this dark, mysterious film, and the actors are terrific, each character hooked on this fantasy in his own way. The end of the film is haunting. Well worth seeing.

    The first time i saw M.Butterfly i thought it is not a typical Cronenberg's movie. The second time, i saw i feel like it's definitely a Cronenberg movie, not about the body deformations but about the emotional deformations. Especially the scene which was shot in the police van, was one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen. It is such a good movie about love and obsession. There are not enough words to describe the performance of Jeremy Irons and John Lone. It is a MUST SEE!! not just for Cronenberg fans but also for every people who appreciate a good movie. Just take a deep breath before you watch it and be sure that you can handle it.

    This film was awful in ways that I have never experienced before. The photography is so cheesy, the sets are totally unconvincing, direction and performances are empty, it deals with big events in an amateur theatrical way, the script is boring, the storytelling is dire, the music is incessantly irritating, the Great Wall of China becomes a joke, the only believable location is Paris, because it's the only real location! The whole thing is creepy, an when the 'twist' is revealed it just gets creepier. There are even some good actors in the cast, so hat's off to David Cronenberg for the worst film I ever endured. I hate to think I suffered in vain, please don't watch this film!

    I saw this movie today on DVD and was mesmerized. Jeremy Irons portrayal of a man lost in love tore me apart. While the narrative seem incredulous so as to be a fairy tale, I found out on the internet that its based on a true story and events similar to what was depicted did happen. It makes the tale even more tragic. The cinematography of the movie is dark, still - reflective of the forbidden love between the French diplomat and the Chinese opera singer. The screenplay is fabulous. There is love in the time of war, espionage, politics and change happening constantly. The writers focus less on the events and more on the characters - lacing the actors' every action with meaning and symbolism. Politics are there to define the era and changing times, but no sides are taken. The dialog is intelligent with sentences about daily life that would normally feel stilted in real life. But Jeremey Irons and John Lone do full justice to the strange material - not only injecting believability in the script but transporting us all to the house of the tortured opera singer where love and sin become intertwined. I do not understand why the movie and its actors and director did not get any nominations let alone an Oscar. Towards the end the movie does face some merciless editing which creates unanswered questions - probably to contain the length. However the last scene is so poignant, it left me heartbroken. I have not seen a more powerful portrayal of forbidden love and loss in a long time.

    I remember when M. Butterfly was released in Brazil, back in 1993. I was just 13 years old then, but already loved Cronenberg films. The Crying Game had come out a year earlier, to much critical acclaim and financial success. M. Butterfly was thematically similar, but slightly better than Neil Jordan's movie. What it unfortunately wasn't is as financially successful. I must say that what kept audiences away wasn't Cronenberg's fault, but maybe a wrong perception of the picture. The film relied heavily on "the twist". In this particular case, on the fact that Irons' "butterfly" was, in fact, a man, which should be this big secret, to be revealed at the last half hour. It was a lost cause, a twist the heads at Warner Bros. couldn't back up: one would simply need to take a look at the poster and find the John Lone name right next to Jeremy Irons, to guess where this story is heading. The thing is, "butterfly's" sexuality wasn't important to this story, as much as people tend to think so. We know that in the real case the film was based on, the Rene Gallimard person was a bisexual man, which is very telling. My take is, there was a part of him, throughout all those years, that knew that his "butterfly" was a man. He chose to live the illusion, to blind himself from the truth, and it was perfect while it lasted. A moment that underlines this assumption is when John Lone enters the courtroom. The look Irons gives to him, he isn't surprised or devastated. He gives a knowing smile. Once the fantasy slips away with the woman's costume, it's over for Rene and Song Liling. I believe that M. Butterfly should not be taken as a movie with a twist, because there is none, the truth is right at our faces the whole time, but as a gripping, highly magnetic character study, a look into obsession, and a well-made period piece, a window of sorts to a part of the history of China we didn't really fully know. Dead Ringers remains the defining moment in David Cronenberg's career, but M. Butterfly is a great one, nonetheless, and highly recommended.

    M. BUTTERFLY: A Unique Love Affair and Political Intrigue

    M. BUTTERFLY continues to rank among the more important cinematic adaptations of a brilliant play - this one by the playwright David Henry Hwang. Having the pleasure to see two productions of the play - New York and Los Angeles - and viewing the film (1993) in the theater and on DVD brings an immense amount of satisfaction of just how fine this work is and continues to satisfy. The fact that David Henry Hwang wrote the screenplay suggests how true to the original the film is and how much of an impact it makes on the viewer M. BUTTERFLY is based on a true story that stunned the world. During the Cultural Revolution in China in the mid-1960s, a French diplomat Ren&eacute; Gallimard (a brilliant portrayal by Jeremy Irons) falls in love with a Chinese opera singer Song Liling (John Lone) - women were never allowed to sing in the Beijing Opera so the fact that Song is a man is credible. Song Liling touches him with a love as vivid, as seductive--and as elusive--as a butterfly. The love affair is so fragile and respectful that Ren&eacute; does not suspect that Song is a man in disguise. Ren&eacute; Is an important diplomat with the French Embassy, married to Jeanne (Barbara Sukowa), and is responsible for maintaining the high standards of diplomacy. Song Liling has been placed in the position of an undercover agent to gather secrets from the Embassy about the American plans in Vietnam. As Ren&eacute; is promoted he demands to see his M. Butterfly without her clothes, an Song's only protection about her gender identity is to reveal that she is pregnant with Ren&eacute;'s child and must leave to be with her family until the child is born. As the Cultural Revolution heightens the French Embassy is to be diminished and it is discovered that Ren&eacute; has been in a liaison with with a Chinese spy and is sent back to France to be imprisoned. When he is put on trial Song appears in Paris to be placed on the witness stand and since years have passed since their last meeting, Song attempts to offer herself once again to be Ren&eacute;'s Butterfly. Whether or not Ren&eacute;'s passion was a flight of fancy, it sparked the most vigorous emotions of his life. Only in real life could love become so unreal. And only in such a dramatic tour de force do we learn how a fantasy can become a man's mistress--as well as his jailer. In a desperately touching final scene we see the imprisoned Ren&eacute; perform the final act from the opera that has accompanied this film - Puccini's MADAMA BUTTERFLY. The story is at once compelling, explosive and slyly humorous, 'a work of unrivaled brilliance, illuminating the conflict between men and women, the differences between East and West, racial stereotypes--and the shadows we cast around our most cherished illusions.' The musical score by Howard Shore integrates arias and choruses from Puccini's opera with music from Chinese opera and his own sensuously beautiful original musical score. David Cronenberg directs with the tight amount of surreal disbelief the piece needs, but it is the brilliant acting of Jeremy Irons and John Lone that illuminate this film. It is a masterwork.

    This is a more richly woven Naked Lunch to my mind, a study on the efforts to discern truth from the makings of fantasy. In terms of Japanese film, it is what Mizoguchi was trying to posit in his later films about cultivated images obscuring a tortured heart, and which fueled at the time a second idyll with Oriental culture. The first was the time when Madame Butterfly was written, with Japanese perspectives for the first time pouring across Europe. The film is patterned around this, the Madame Butterfly opera about a geisha falling madly in love with a Westerner who is unworthy of that love, and the violent repercussions on both ends of a growing obsession. And real life mirrored from this with sexuality inversed, the events of an actual case that may be the weirdest in world espionage. Both are layered here, fiction and life. On one hand it is about the Westerner's efforts, recast here as a French diplomat in 60's Beijing, at first condescending, cynical but gradually admiring, to capture the heart of a strange exotic world. That world seduces him with the face of a Chinese opera singer, herself a Butterfly performing the opera when we first see her, exuding all those things the idealized image of the Orient is meant to: ancient mystery, scented allure, covert eroticism. (of course we know that the Madame Butterfly opera was based on a story in turn based on recollections of the writer's wife from her visit in Japan. It is a purely Methodist dream of the Orient, itself a prosthetic hybrid, an illusion. There was never any inside truth in the adopted images, any truly Oriental heart to be captured) From her end, we learn that she is manipulating that image from inside, presenting what he wishes to see to gain actual knowledge of Western machinations. But of course, this being patterned after an opera, it is about the music, not the story. So all the lachrymose love stuff makes sense, that may seem overt and heavyhanded at first glance. The flowery visuals, arranged in decorative beauty. The complete artifice of a stagebound China, that only furthers the connection with a staged reality. The project was originally meant for Peter Weir, no doubt he would have envisioned a better density for this world, a more enveloping alienation from the encounter; but the material suits Cronenberg's prosthetic worldview just fine. More than fine. The idea is that everything groomed to look beautitul should be revealed deceptive, illusionary. So he creates a natural copy of everything that should have rung true and lived, based on the idea that as an audience we are as open and eager to be seduced by images as the protagonist is. It works just subtly enough to throw us for a loop as just another Oscar bait about love and political intrigue. It is not, with all the emotional outpour that we experience as the film perversed as the instruments of a cruel deception. With victims us who genuinely believed in it. Of course what the man thinks he has learned from her was all lies, all because he failed to see truly; this is recast as a political comment with him feeding estimations about the Vietnam war to his superiors, all wrong. And a second political comment, again as pertaining to a Western dream; young leftist students rioting back in France in the name of Mao and the Cultural Revolution. We know how that panned out, what suffering was concealed in the idealized image broadcast abroad. It ends with a purely operatic transformation that is Cronenberg's turf, set up on a stage before an audience. Full circle with another Butterfly performing a role, but this one funneling broken soul into the thing. Everything is questioned, identity, contact, even sex. The result elicits a shock that is real, it's quite wonderful to watch. Overall it is near masterful stuff for me, about the power of images to seduce and break. I could see something like this come from Peter Greenaway, with the whole thing in quotation marks. But Cronenberg was daft or smart enough, I can't tell which, to make the maudlin and wooden stuff so unassuming it works deeper than Greenaway would allow. So it's not really a conventional love story but only dealt with in those terms. The opera that he's watching around him. So a man falling in love with an idealized depiction of beauty, itself a cinematic essence, but that we have to deal with as viewers on our own. Do we open up to it only to be hurt when he is? Do we keep our distance and admire aesthetically?

    "Only a man knows how a woman should act." - Song Liling David Croneberg's "M. Butterfly" stars Jeremy Irons as Rene Gallimard, a French diplomat who falls in love with Song Liling, a Chinese spy and opera performer. Rene may or may not be gay and may or may not know that Song, who also may or may not be gay, is a man rather than a woman. Song stars in "Madame Butterfly", an opera about illusory love. Within the opera, Song plays a woman. Outside the opera, Song deliberately acts "feminine" - whereby "femininity" is understood as a series of calculated signs rather than anything intrinsic - in order to get close to Rene. Once he realises that Song is male, Rene morphs into a woman. Rene's name conjures up philosopher Rene Descartes' mind/body schism. The film's title echoes another of Cronenberg's metamorphosis movies, "The Fly". Descartes formulated a now famous dualist speculation of the mind in his "Meditations on First Philosophy". This is where he presented what would become the "mind-body problem", the idea that the body and mind, or flesh and spirit, exist as distinct substances. Descartes reasoned that one's thoughts, guided by reason and rationality, identify them as a person, and that one exists only so long as one's thoughts exist. Bodies, in contrast, are merely an extended, mechanical composition governed by the physical laws of nature. For Descartes, the mind could and should not be understood in the same terms as the body. Today Cartesian dualism has either been refuted or completely redefined, though what is known as the "hard problem" (of the mind, body and consciousness) remains unsolved. Lines of thought tend to run either toward monism or dualism, both of which have subsets like interactionism, parallelism, occasionalism, materialism, behaviourism, functionalism, or epiphenomenalism, the latter stating that the brain simply causes mental events as a neurological by-product, and that mental events cannot cause behaviour. Some of these branches suggest that there is no mind, others posit that the mind is controlled by nature and has no or limited free will. Today discussions are drifting toward a form of Quantum mysticism. Regardless, for Cronenberg the body is an amalgamation of both feminine and masculine qualities, the mind does not exist as traditionally thought and identities are engineered, synthesised and collapsible. Unlike Descartes, existence for Cronenberg requires both a mental configuration and a biological configuration; a multiplicity of self-identification in which identity and identity formation are cyclical, fluid and variable. Where Descartes attempts to arrive at a solid, stable point, Cronenberg posits identity as evolving without any preordained certainty, shows the importance of the outside in defining the Self, and distrusts the notion that we can arrive at any certainty, fixedness, or place beyond change. In a sense, the Rene character parodies Descartes. What he is is not quite in his hands. Descartes also formulated a "Separation Thesis", in which the body is essentially shown to have less value than the mind. This has given rise to a certain aversion to the body, and a bevy of tales in which man neurotically attempts to "transcend his icky, primitive flesh". This, of course, echoes Cronenberg's "body horror" movies. In Cronenberg's "The Fly", for example, Seth Brundle's "mind" develops an aversion  a battle which the intellect always loses as it surrenders to madness - to a wild, unresponsive, conspiratorial, rebellious body which dares confront the autonomy of the "mind". Rather than the "mind" triumphing over matter, Brundle is consumed by flesh and becomes a bundle of human, animal and machine by the film's end, having been unable to achieve a comfortable synthesis of intellect, emotion and technology. But while "The Fly" shows the "mind" overpowered by flesh, Brundle's perceived loss of autonomy generating a sort of grotesque, monstrous form of self hate, "Butterfly's" hero explicitly desires his transformation. Rene's disconnect between Mind/Gender (I am a woman!) and Body/Sex (But I'm male!) results in Rene actively desiring a transformed body to live in, rather than the Existenz-like simulation he created to sustain his prior delusions. End result: it is multiplicity (consciousness, body, inside, outside, nervous system, DNA, flesh etc) which results in causation, the "mind" does not exist as a single entity, and the psyche and the soma are combinations of the shared experiences arising from innumerable interactions. Metamorphoses occur in other Cronenberg flicks, most of which show how a revulsion toward corporeality pushes men toward technology. Technology then becomes the physical expression, the dream, of the body as it writes its desires on social life. Much of this echoes the filmography of Kubrick; think man's "transcendental journey" in "2001", in which mankind forever points to but never reaches a technologically sleek monolith, attaining instead fleshy corporeality, and the mind/body splits of "Full Metal Jacket", in which both the military and a dissenting marine rigidly attempt to manufacture gender roles and demarcations between head and body. Both directors show how accepted social binaries are but symptoms of Western culture and how first person phenomenal experience outside discursive contexts is but a liberal humanist delusion of self (liberal humanism proposes that the subject is the free, unconstrained author of meaning and action, the origin of history etc). Incidentally, "M. Butterfly" - oft dubbed "the ultimate postmodern, post-structuralist play" - was originally a stage-play by David Hwang. Hwang's play, like "Full Metal Jacket" (itself a cocoonish, butterflyish title), was about how empires construct identity (West/masculine, Other/East/feminine), about Patriarchy as the basis for imperial conquest, colonial discourse, and hierarchical definitions of geopolitics, ethnicity, gender, and race. In the play, binaries are shattered as Rene's role as spectator/audience/masculine/west is reversed by the duplicitous Song. It is then Rene who becomes the Butterfly (effeminate/object/fcked), duped by love. Cronenberg's film is less interested in these broader issues. 6/10  Worth one viewing.

This does not have the "science" of Cronenberg, the "flesh" aspect, but as he says in a feature on the DVD, he leans towards odd communities as a filmmaker. And truly, there are some odd people here... is Song in love with Gallimard or just playing him? What is her secret? I loved the multiple twists and how smoothly they were revealed. Roger Ebert sees the big twist as obvious from the start, but I think this might be because he cheated. I have to agree with him on this comment, though: "Irons bases his performance on the understanding that erotic impulses are always completely humorless to those who hold them, even though they might seem hilarious to the observer." That, and Irons naturally has a very humorless persona -- even when he jokes, he is all too serious. I never saw the original play or read it, so I cannot make any educated comparisons to source material. But the film is great, and while not one of Cronenberg's better known films, still a must-see. Just so weird in a non-weird way.

    Even directors as acclaimed as David Cronenberg have to have some duds in their filmography. Enter M. Butterfly, the odd and empty story of a French civil servant agent who falls in love with an opera singer while working in Beijing. It is set during the cultural revolution of 1960's China as tensions rise due to uncontrollable issues. But the real problems stem from the relationship between Rene Gallimard and his lover, Song Liling, which takes an unforeseen turn when you least expect it. This is just one of those films that is flat, dull, unconvincing, and just downright bland. So little happens for the first half of the film and what does happen is an uninteresting and unengaging romance that unfolds at an awkward pace with no real emotion or motivation behind it. This is a story that demands a lot of passion and emotion behind it in order to be truly compelling. The film falls flat here and never managed to keep my interest. The story here isn't terrible. It is based on a true story and that always adds a different element of intrigue, but the execution of this story is very poor. It could have been incredible, but I simply found nothing interesting here, at least for the first half. After a while I asked myself just why Cronenberg directed a sappy foreign country romance like this. Then a very specific and completely unexpected element was introduced and I quickly found myself saying, "Aha. That's why Cronenberg directed this." The conclusion of this film is sudden and unfolds too quickly to have any real emotional force behind it. By this point in the film my interest in these characters and events had flat lined so I was only appalled and irritated by the direction this film had gone. There isn't a much easier way to put it other than it is simply not good and not fun. It was quite the disappointment to see a lot of potential go to waste. I started out disliking this film and by the end I didn't like it any more than I had before, but I wanted it to be so much better and I longed for it to be more emotionally engaging in order to achieve the full affect which this story has the potential to do. But it just simply fell flat. It is evident that Cronenberg put some effort into this film but just missed the mark and managed to produce a dull and painfully uninteresting story out of something that could have been extremely intriguing. M. Butterfly is something different, but not really worth the watch.

    Or, conversely, love doesn't know the gender it loves. Jeremy Irons and John Lone star in "M. Butterfly," based on the hit play by David Henry Hwang. In the mid-'60s, while the cultural revolution is going on in China, French Vice Consul Phillipe Bouriscot (Irons) falls in love with a singer, Song (John Lone), who performs with the Bejing opera. He believes Song to be a woman. And, like the story of "Madame Butterfly," there is love, there is betrayal, and there is humiliation. As unbelievable as this story might be, it's based on a true one. The film doesn't go into how this fantasy was actually executed physically, but in point of fact, in real life, the character played by Irons believed he had gotten Song pregnant. Odd but true. David Cronenberg does an excellent job with this dark, mysterious film, and the actors are terrific, each character hooked on this fantasy in his own way. The end of the film is haunting. Well worth seeing.

    The first time i saw M.Butterfly i thought it is not a typical Cronenberg's movie. The second time, i saw i feel like it's definitely a Cronenberg movie, not about the body deformations but about the emotional deformations. Especially the scene which was shot in the police van, was one of the most disturbing scenes i have ever seen. It is such a good movie about love and obsession. There are not enough words to describe the performance of Jeremy Irons and John Lone. It is a MUST SEE!! not just for Cronenberg fans but also for every people who appreciate a good movie. Just take a deep breath before you watch it and be sure that you can handle it.

    This film was awful in ways that I have never experienced before. The photography is so cheesy, the sets are totally unconvincing, direction and performances are empty, it deals with big events in an amateur theatrical way, the script is boring, the storytelling is dire, the music is incessantly irritating, the Great Wall of China becomes a joke, the only believable location is Paris, because it's the only real location! The whole thing is creepy, an when the 'twist' is revealed it just gets creepier. There are even some good actors in the cast, so hat's off to David Cronenberg for the worst film I ever endured. I hate to think I suffered in vain, please don't watch this film!
