    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....

    I shall start by saying that I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I must confess that Foreign Correspondent had always passed me by. I'm not sure what it was that put me off the idea of watching it before. Perhaps it was the thought of Joel McCrea, who I had always considered a rather dull leading man in Westerns. How wrong I was! This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....

    I shall start by saying that I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I must confess that Foreign Correspondent had always passed me by. I'm not sure what it was that put me off the idea of watching it before. Perhaps it was the thought of Joel McCrea, who I had always considered a rather dull leading man in Westerns. How wrong I was! This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....

    I shall start by saying that I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I must confess that Foreign Correspondent had always passed me by. I'm not sure what it was that put me off the idea of watching it before. Perhaps it was the thought of Joel McCrea, who I had always considered a rather dull leading man in Westerns. How wrong I was! This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....

    I shall start by saying that I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I must confess that Foreign Correspondent had always passed me by. I'm not sure what it was that put me off the idea of watching it before. Perhaps it was the thought of Joel McCrea, who I had always considered a rather dull leading man in Westerns. How wrong I was! This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....

    I shall start by saying that I am a huge Hitchcock fan, but I must confess that Foreign Correspondent had always passed me by. I'm not sure what it was that put me off the idea of watching it before. Perhaps it was the thought of Joel McCrea, who I had always considered a rather dull leading man in Westerns. How wrong I was! This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

This film was excellent, and McCrea was wonderful in it. His easy manner was very engaging, and the interplay between him, Laraine Day and the very youthful and charming George Sanders was absolutely delightful. At one point, it almost seemed that Sanders had taken the lead in the story, with much of the screen time given over to him when on the trail of the spies in London. The scene where Sanders tracks down the kidnapped Mr Van Meer, and witnesses his torture is particularly well done, as is the justly famous scene with McCrea in the windmill. Very exciting stuff. I take my hat off to Messrs Hitchcock, McCrea and Sanders. The rest of the cast was equally fantastic: The lovely Laraine Day, who seemed to really be enjoying herself in the scenes with Sanders and McCrea; Herbert Marshall, an almost sympathetic villain; Eduardo Cianelli, the archetypal 1940's enemy agent; and the excellent Edmund Gwenn in a brief but brilliant moment as Rowley, the hapless assassin. Hitchcock always peopled his films with interesting faces, and this is no exception; the tramp in the windmill; the ladies in the house where Van Meer is held captive etc. Hitchcock was a true genius, and with his eye for detail, it's not hard to understand why he is held in such high regard. This film highlights many amazing examples of that 'eye', ranging from the hit-man pushing his way through the sea of umbrellas, to Van Meer trying to focus on his captors after being subjected to blinding lights. If you are a Hitchcock fan, then you probably already admire this film, but, if for some reason it has passed you by, rectify the situation, and watch it as soon as possible. THIS FILM IS A DELIGHT!

    I found this film to be quite entertaining! I generally like war based movies and the action they entail. In this particular movie it involved spies, although the main character is not a spy, but simply a reporter. He gets caught up in the action of the war so to speak. There is also the common man falls in love with a beautiful woman going on in the plot. Little does she know her father is covering up and working with the "bad guys". I like the sarcasm used between the reporter and the daughter. It was a nice scene of humor even when the film itself is not a pleasant one. I also really enjoyed the chase scene and the message/ radio cast he gives at the end. I liked how he was determined to finish and keep the light of hope, just as the Americans were doing during the war!

    I'm embarrassed to say that this is the first Hitchcock movie I have ever seen. I can now see why Alfred Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors of all time. The dialogue of this movie is very well written and delivered even better. Hitchcock's creation of suspense is something I have only heard about but now, for the first time I have the pleasure of experiencing it first hand. The way the actors move along the frame is clearly well thought out by Hitchcock. The plane crash scene in this movie must be the most tense movie scene that has every existed for it's time. Only one of history's greatest directors could make a scene when such great tensity and great acting.

    It wasn't until very recently when I watched Foreign Correspondent for the first time, only two days in fact. And even now I am kicking myself for not having seen it before. Foreign Correspondent is a real gem, and as of now in my top 10 Hitchcock films, it is also one of his most overlooked. It is a splendidly made and directed film, the plane crash was superbly shot and one of my favourite Hitchcock set pieces in this regard. The music is both jaunty and haunting, and the script is one of the wittiest and most playful of any of Hitchcock's films in my view. The story has never a dull moment and is always clever, suspenseful and compelling, I didn't see anything that leapt out as dated or propaganda at all. There are some terrifically tense set pieces too, especially the ones with the Dutch windmill, Westminster Cathedral and the plane crash, and the romance between McCrea and Day is a little too abruptly introduced but is still very sweet and touching. I also loved the cast, Joel McCrea is effectively smooth, compared to other Hitchcock heroes he is rather lightweight but this is in comparison we're talking about(and he isn't even distractingly so). Larraine Day could have had more to work with but is instantly appealing in her roles and works very well with McCrea. The supporting cast fare even better though, especially George Sanders who is deliciously suave and dour(and in a way that few actors have equalled him in), Edmund Gwenn who is both menacingly untrustworthy and offbeat and Albert Basserman who is quite touching in his role. Herbert Marshall also acquits himself beautifully as does Robert Benchley. All in all, one of my personal favourites as of now from the Master of Suspense and also one that deserves more attention. Out of the Hitchcock films that I've seen for the first time as well Foreign Correspondent has also been the best one. 10/10 Bethany Cox

    Though a bit preachy (WWII was about to start) and overlong (2-hours), the movie's still a gripping Hitchcock, only his second in the US. That windmill sequence has stayed with me for sixty years. How clever the entire set-up is, not quite like anything else I've seen. Notice especially the excellence of the exterior setthe sky, the windmills these visuals are exceptional for a sound stage creation. Then too, I love the way Hitch builds suspense in the tower scene with all the untimely intrusions. Still it's difficult to see Santa from Miracle on 34th Street (1947) as a heartless killer. Then too, there's that pure Hichcockian assassination scene with the umbrellas and the unflinching camera as the bullet strikes Van Meer's face. And finally, the cockpit crash scene that's still jarring. Thanks IMDb for explaining how it was done. For its time, the unswerving camera as the plane strikes water was both daring and imaginative. To me, these are exceptional dramatic highlights. On the whole the narrative is engaging as we follow efforts to locate the real Van Meer, while the romantic angle is woven cleverly into the plot without being obtrusive. And for a political movie of the time, note that the term Nazi is not used even once. The narrative manages to keep the sinister nationality of the plotters anonymous, but we know who is meant. Note too how animated the usually reserved George Sanders is in his scenes. It's almost a problem since he overshadows the quieter hero, Joel McCrea. True McCrea is a little palid in his role as a reporter, still he comes across as appropriately likable and assertive when necessary, as in the hidden phone sequence. Nonetheless, the movie's a worthy entry in the Master of Suspense's film catalog and if it's not as well known as many of his other 40's movies, it should be.

    This is one of the Hitchcocks I've enjoyed the most so far -- possibly because it isn't famous and I had no idea what to expect, but more probably because it has just the right mixture of humour, thrills and sympathy to appeal to me. (In Hitchcock's subsequent "Saboteur", for example, I would end up finding the Hollywood hero so annoying that when the villains' bomb actually went off successfully I found myself cheering...) A young Joel McCrea is more successful here as the all-American hero -- although Edmund Gwenn easily manages to steal the limelight as 'private detective' Rowley in their few scenes together, and again, I found myself waiting impatiently for Rowley to get his opportunity rather than biting my nails over the American's peril! -- but is, as others have said, a fairly generic light romantic character. He is at his best in the comedy scenes, and there is one hilarious double-act between him and George Sanders at the end of the film in which the two are assiduously 'not' reporting their story down the telephone in a piece of the broadest (deliberate) exposition imaginable. But it is the English cast who steal the show: Herbert Marshall in a 'Claude Rains' role, likable, resourceful, and surprisingly human for a propaganda piece portrayal, Edmund Gwenn in a bit-part as retired assassin Rowley, and George Sanders simply strolling away with most of the scenes in which he appears -- he comes very near to stealing the entire film with a charismatic, decisive, witty performance that echoes his contemporary roles as "The Saint", minus the languor he brought to that part. Laraine Day gives a charming and sensitive performance, and works together well with Marshall as her father, while Martin Kosleck's striking features can be glimpsed in a bit-part scene in a windmill. This may not be a great film, but it is an enjoyable one, with genuine thrills spiced up with wry or overt humour: as often with Hitchcock, it probably doesn't pay to examine the plot too closely (and it would be nice just for once to see a film about a *genuine* peace movement: I suppose that would be too boring...), but it's a fun romp, especially if you genuinely don't know what's coming next. A slight unbalance of interest away from the hero, who basically ends up as Sanders' sidekick -- but from the point of view of this member of the audience at least, that was all to the good.

    If someone is looking for a film that has everything: Suspense, action, comedy, drama, romance, spies, murder, and a powerful message this is a film for you. It goes without saying that Hitchcock is one of the greatest directors in Film History (I might pick him NUMBER ONE), but here he outdoes himself. Spoilers: Newspaperman Johnny Jones (Joel McCrea) is renamed as Huntley Haverstock and sent out by his boss Mr. Powers (Harry Davenport)to to Europe to find news. What happens is he gets himself in constant situations where he comes close to death, included is an attempt to push him off by a Nazi spy named Rowley (Edmund Gwenn), being pursued by agents in a hotel (Where he meets Carol Fisher (Larraine Day)), and finally being shot down over the Atlantic by a U-Boat and along with Carol, her father Stephen Fisher (Herbert Marshall), who is the head of a peace organization, while working as a deep cover mole for German Intelligene, Scotland Yard Officer Ffolliott (George Sanders), and several others. Eventually Fisher sacrifices himself by throwing himself in the sea, and the others are rescued by an American Ship who because the USA was neutral in the War, and the Captain was not happy about the fact they had a reporter on board. I love the fact that Johnny was willing to give up the story that Fisher was a traitor and was involved with the kidnapping of a Diplomat named Van Meer (Albert Basserman), because he loved Carol, and when Carol heard that she wanted the World to know and she said "I don't want you to protect my father, he fought the hard way for his country (Germany), and I will fight the hard way for my country." So Johnny along with Ffolliott and Carol made sure that Mr. Powers got the story via the ship's radio. At the very end, Johnny and Carol were broadcasting during the Blitz of London, and said "how the lights went out and death is coming to London, and for America to send tanks, planes and battleships, and to keep the light on, because you are the only light left on in the world." I cannot even think of one thing about this film I did not like, from start to finish. A flawless film.

    Watching this I can see all the elements of his later...and better...spy/thriller films. This one seems almost like a "training" or "getting it together right" typa project. Trying to put all the elements together in the right order like he did so well with his later 50's successes. Being that this film was made in 1939 it still packs a "paranoid" punch. As old as it is it'll still make you think about how politics and war always go hand in hand. It'll make you think...in a light way...whose side the people around you are on cause you never really know who someone is...deep down inside. There are a few quibbles I have. One being the scene where the "fake" gets shot instead of the real guy. The part where the assassin just runs around with hundreds of people around and someone quite easily could have stopped this guy in his tracks was a laugh. It made me laugh and give the screen a..."come on...get the guy!!!". Another scene was the famed "bleak" landscape scene where the windmills are (very reminiscent of the North by Northwest scenery years later). They chase the bad guys into a baron area and they just....lose em. Looking around the area, how in the world did these guys just escape outta the blue when they were clearly in site of the car chasing them? The funniest part is these geniuses never checked tire tracks to see that they went into the windmill a few yards away. To me that wasn't even a remotely plausible scene unless the 3 characters in that scene were just too stupid for the films sake. My quibbles with this film are minor but for a better feel on Hitchcock and his spy/thriller films....try any film he did in the 50's and you'll see that Foreign Correspondant was an early "training" film of his to get is legendary technique...down to a science.

    Not the best Hitchcock film, but exciting enough as a correspondent (Western star Joel McCrea) is sent to Europe before the war to find out the truth. He stumbles upon the assignation of a diplomat (Albert Bassermann) and the hunt is on for those behind it. The suspense builds as our correspondent teams with Oscar-winner George Sanders (All About Eve) to trap their suspect (Herbert Marshall). In the meantime, our correspondent falls in love with the suspect's daughter (Laraine Day). It all comes to an end as the war starts. But, that is not the end: it is the beginning. Basserman got an Oscar nomination for his supporting role, and the film itself was nominated for Best Picture, oddly losing to another Hitchcock film, Rebecca. Rebecca also took the cinematography award. The screenplay, special effects, and art direction were also nominated. Two good films by the same director in one year. I wonder if that has happened before or since.

    Wasn't that fond of this Hitchcock film. It was good but not what I thought it would be. The story was OK, but I was expecting a North by Northwest feel to it. Nominated for a number of awards (up against another Hitchcock movie, Rebecca) It did not win any, but that does not take away from the honor. I would call this a "transitional" movie between Hitchcock's British and American periods, by subject matter and locations. Outstanding special effects, which were quite innovative and still hold their own over time. Crisp clear sound and cinematography, quick clips of humor and a sense of style at a crossroads of change. Historically interesting as well...I wonder, just how did everyone seem to know that war was going to be declared the next day? A definite appeal to emotion from the British Hitchcock to the Americans....
