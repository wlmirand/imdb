    I do remember 11 years ago (or so I don't know) seeing the trailer for this film, and I wanted to see at theaters - but I didn't get a chance. But when it came out on video, I got it as a Valentine's Day gift from my Mom. When I watched it, I really loved it; though I can remember I had only watched it a couple of times long ago - until now that is. The film starts when 10-year-old Ryan Tyler goes to China during his spring break to visit his zoologist dad Michael, who has been working on a project to rescue the dwindling panda population. But there was poacher trouble and Ryan, along with young assistant/translator Ling decide to rescue an adorable panda cub, which has been "animal-napped" and they must return him to its mother, whom Dr. Tyler rescued from a trap and brought back to the reserve to care for. Braving hardships and facing unexpected adventures, the two youngsters learn to love and respect for pandas as they gain maturity and tolerance for each other of course. Like I said (a million times), I was shocked by the negative reviews/ratings I would see on the web, I mean I love films about human/animal relations; this film has heart and a little humor. And I think films like this one would enlists peoples' sympathies for the Giant Panda population.

    My Take: Harmless yet decent family entertainment. Nothing more, nothing less. Think MY DOG SKIP with a panda. Here, the little boy happens to be the son of zoologist with a devotion to a Chinese Panda reserve. What if the boy and his friend, daughter of his father's right hand man, happens to rescue a cute little Panda cub from two Chinese stereotype poachers? This is exactly what THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE is about, and it does nothing else. While it isn't a great effort, and surely not above others of its craft, THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE is entertaining, and basically perfect for an evening matin&eacute;e with the kids. Newcomer Ryan Slater plays the little kid visiting his zoologist father (Stephen Lang) in a Panda reserve, on the verge of being savaged by officious bureaucrats. He also gets his hands tangled with a plot to save a small Panda cub from the hands of two bumbling poachers, who happen to be Chinese for a change, no less. The movie has very little happening then on, except for mild peril and adventure. Trekking through forests and villages, dodging poachers until reaching into its finale, THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE isn't exactly an exciting or terrific adventure, but for harmless family viewing, it isn't a bad shot at trying. The panda, by the way, is a convincing and cute alternating use of a real cub and a realistic animatronic puppet. The settings are also lush and captures the feel of the moments situations. Regardless its shortcomings and weaknesses, THE AMAZING PANDA ADVENTURE is nonetheless harmlessly entertaining. Rent it for the kids. Rating: *** out of 5.

    If there was ever a movie that i could say I was criticizing before i was really criticizing films, it would have to be the amazing panda adventure. this movie is really, really bad. it hardly hits with any emotional impact, it's rather a money maker. that's it. the only thing the people who made this movie wanted, was a quick buck. anyways, let's review. We have 10 year old Ryan who's taking his week-long trip to china to hang out with his dad, who researches the near extinct panda bear. we have Mr. Tyler (Ryan's dad) who is so caught up in his work he doesn't care about his son. we have chu, who is also in research with pandas, and he have his granddaughter, ling (take a moment to wipe the drool from your chin) the ever so hot Chinese girl that translates for Mr. Tyler when he converses with chu, and the other Chinese people. Now thats all i'm gonna reveal to this crappy flick. first of all, the acting is weak, and sometimes too strong, just like American beer compared to molson Canadian cold shots. the dialog makes Americans look like heroes and Chinese people look stupid, hence the lines - Ling: You are a Mormon! Ryan: i think you mean moron. - how stupid. Just like Grizzly mountain, the scenery is awesome, and the rest is total poo-poo. the acting, the story lines, the dialog, it's bad. watch out for this one in discount bins on VHS, hence the time it came out. 5/10

    GOOD - There is some wonderful Chinese mountain scenery in here, really beautiful. The pandas are "cute," too, as expected. They are always fun to watch. BAD - Instead of this being about the pandas, the kids in here (or the screenwriters) make it more about themselves. Included in their scenes are some incredibly stupid dialog. Just as insulting was a big scene near the end where the children physically fend off the adult poachers. Yeah, right. In between, we get the normal plug for New Age "mountain spirits" and the like. OVERALL - Entertaining but the kids in her are very annoying at times.....too annoying for a second viewing.

    Lighten up! This movie IS FOR KIDS! My 9 year old daughter and her Chinese mom really enjoyed this. The admittedly fake storyline (which could have been stolen from any of about nine million family wildlife movies) is overcome by the sheer personality of the panda cub and the terrific scenery. There are very few movies that depict either pandas or the beautiful Chinese panda reserves. The movie also shows the American contribution to the preservation of the pandas; the Chinese government wasn't doing much at all until American naturalists got involved in the 70's. Kids will enjoy this and you crabby adults will survive it.

    Ryan Slater is awkward as Ryan in this wistful adventure farce. The supporting cast is tantalizing. The costumes are trendy. One of the fair movies in the genre, The Amazing Panda Adventure delivers hollow adventures. 6 out of 10.

    I watched this movie with friends and we laughed the whole way through. This would be fine, if the movie was a comedy, but instead its a bland and ultimately forgettable childrens flick. You can tell that RYAN only got the part because he was Christian Slaters brother, as he hams up the screen throughout its entirety. LING is certainly no better, her fake asian accent is pathetic, as is her acting ability. I realize they are only kids but there have been good child actors before, and these two aren't up to scratch. The real star of the show is the panda, it shows character throughout, especially in the scene when it attacks Ryan on the bridge. This of course excludes the scenes in which it is played by a robot, did the director actually think that thing looked like a real panda? Overall this film is bad, but watchable Family material. The kids will probably love it, but there are better films around. Rehire E.T., the Goonies, or even Toy story, these films are more sincere and watchable then this movie, and will actually be remembered in time to come.

    Boy this was awful. Really really bad. I think the scene that best embodies how unrealistic and moronic this film truly is, would be the one in which the two main characters (who are only about 14) find themselves covered with leeches, and so they spontaneously take off all their clothes and jump in a river, and then look SURPRISED that they've done so. Like they didn't realize that this was a stupid idea WHILE they were doing it. Now we get to sit and watch as the movie awkwardly bumbles its way through the "I'm a guy, you're a girl, we're accidentally naked" schtick. Just shoot me with one of those Panda tranq darts and put me out of my misery. Granted, this film did its job of keeping the kids I was with interested, but unlike most Disney films and other modern flicks geared towards young children, it had nothing to keep the adults even remotely interested. I think the reason that this movie takes place in Hong Kong, is because it's actually a form of ancient Asian torture. Avoid this like the plague. And if you have to choose, take the plague.

    I am outraged that these poor panda bears were put through so much torture to make this movie. Fortunately, the evidence is caught on tape. What you are about to see done to these animals for the sake of entertainment may shock you! The bears are shot at, dragged off of a bridge, tossed over a waterfall, dangled over a cliff, and virtually starved to death. The makers of this film as well as anyone who watches it should be ashamed of this dangerous and gratuitous exploitation of such poor helpless creatures. I have already alerted my congressman, Greenpeace, Ralph Nader and my Mommy. Hopefully a follow-up movie can be made showing the capture and incarceration of the producers...what? The bears are actually robots? Oops....

    The movie offers a rare glimpse into China's countryside (looks spectacular), and the pandas are pretty cute (when they show the real McCoy, and not the animatronics). Aside from that, this is a slow, almost pointless movie. The American kid is very annoying, and I wished he'd fall off one of those gorgeous mountains. The Chinese girl is a little better, but her character is weak - they never explain how come her English is so good. The chemistry between both these kids is pretty much nil. At the end, they don't seem to be either friends, rivals, or anything else. Some viewers may be offended by the way the Tibetian people are portrayed - there's no evidence of the persecution they are under. The poachers are not scary or interesting as well. I grew tired of hearing the same bars of music over and over, and I grew tired of seeing the same shots over and over! I think even kids may be frustrated with this movie.
