    Gregory Peck plays a small-town lawyer named Sam Bowden, whose life is turned upside down after a man he testified against is released from prison after 8 years, and decides on a relentless and vicious campaign of revenge against him. The man named Max Cady(Robert Mitchum, highly effective) targets Sam's family chiefly his wife and daughter, escalating things from insinuation to murdering the family dog, forcing Sam to take direct action against him, though Max, who has had lots of time to study the law, uses it against him. Effective and chilling thriller is well directed by J. Lee Thompson, and features a clever and provocative script that pushed the limits for its time. Max Cady is one of cinema's most evil villains, and builds much suspense to its exciting climax.

    Maybe it is because the movie is a little bit old, I am not too attracted by it. However I appreciate the plays of the two gentleman. As a father and husband Sam expresses what a real responsible man should react and act. He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him. Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works. It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.

    - A This has some of the best suspense I have ever seen in a movie from the first time we see the stalker to the climax of the showdown. Gregory Peck is very good as the lawyer and father and Robert Mitchum is very creepy as the stalker. Whenever there is suspense, it is intense and last as your heart is racing and anticipating what will happen next. Mitchum is able to keep the creepiness going throughout the whole film and is does good at playing innocent. The characters are very good and the story is very well done and this is just a very entertaining thriller. A perfect film for a thriving audience looking for a great film.

    Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA. On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.

    I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.

Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.

    Gregory Peck plays a small-town lawyer named Sam Bowden, whose life is turned upside down after a man he testified against is released from prison after 8 years, and decides on a relentless and vicious campaign of revenge against him. The man named Max Cady(Robert Mitchum, highly effective) targets Sam's family chiefly his wife and daughter, escalating things from insinuation to murdering the family dog, forcing Sam to take direct action against him, though Max, who has had lots of time to study the law, uses it against him. Effective and chilling thriller is well directed by J. Lee Thompson, and features a clever and provocative script that pushed the limits for its time. Max Cady is one of cinema's most evil villains, and builds much suspense to its exciting climax.

    Maybe it is because the movie is a little bit old, I am not too attracted by it. However I appreciate the plays of the two gentleman. As a father and husband Sam expresses what a real responsible man should react and act. He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him. Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works. It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.

    - A This has some of the best suspense I have ever seen in a movie from the first time we see the stalker to the climax of the showdown. Gregory Peck is very good as the lawyer and father and Robert Mitchum is very creepy as the stalker. Whenever there is suspense, it is intense and last as your heart is racing and anticipating what will happen next. Mitchum is able to keep the creepiness going throughout the whole film and is does good at playing innocent. The characters are very good and the story is very well done and this is just a very entertaining thriller. A perfect film for a thriving audience looking for a great film.

    Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA. On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.

    I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.

    Gregory Peck plays a small-town lawyer named Sam Bowden, whose life is turned upside down after a man he testified against is released from prison after 8 years, and decides on a relentless and vicious campaign of revenge against him. The man named Max Cady(Robert Mitchum, highly effective) targets Sam's family chiefly his wife and daughter, escalating things from insinuation to murdering the family dog, forcing Sam to take direct action against him, though Max, who has had lots of time to study the law, uses it against him. Effective and chilling thriller is well directed by J. Lee Thompson, and features a clever and provocative script that pushed the limits for its time. Max Cady is one of cinema's most evil villains, and builds much suspense to its exciting climax.

    Maybe it is because the movie is a little bit old, I am not too attracted by it. However I appreciate the plays of the two gentleman. As a father and husband Sam expresses what a real responsible man should react and act. He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him. Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works. It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.

    - A This has some of the best suspense I have ever seen in a movie from the first time we see the stalker to the climax of the showdown. Gregory Peck is very good as the lawyer and father and Robert Mitchum is very creepy as the stalker. Whenever there is suspense, it is intense and last as your heart is racing and anticipating what will happen next. Mitchum is able to keep the creepiness going throughout the whole film and is does good at playing innocent. The characters are very good and the story is very well done and this is just a very entertaining thriller. A perfect film for a thriving audience looking for a great film.

    Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA. On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.

    I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.

    Gregory Peck plays a small-town lawyer named Sam Bowden, whose life is turned upside down after a man he testified against is released from prison after 8 years, and decides on a relentless and vicious campaign of revenge against him. The man named Max Cady(Robert Mitchum, highly effective) targets Sam's family chiefly his wife and daughter, escalating things from insinuation to murdering the family dog, forcing Sam to take direct action against him, though Max, who has had lots of time to study the law, uses it against him. Effective and chilling thriller is well directed by J. Lee Thompson, and features a clever and provocative script that pushed the limits for its time. Max Cady is one of cinema's most evil villains, and builds much suspense to its exciting climax.

    Maybe it is because the movie is a little bit old, I am not too attracted by it. However I appreciate the plays of the two gentleman. As a father and husband Sam expresses what a real responsible man should react and act. He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him. Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works. It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.

    - A This has some of the best suspense I have ever seen in a movie from the first time we see the stalker to the climax of the showdown. Gregory Peck is very good as the lawyer and father and Robert Mitchum is very creepy as the stalker. Whenever there is suspense, it is intense and last as your heart is racing and anticipating what will happen next. Mitchum is able to keep the creepiness going throughout the whole film and is does good at playing innocent. The characters are very good and the story is very well done and this is just a very entertaining thriller. A perfect film for a thriving audience looking for a great film.

    Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA. On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.

    I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.

    Gregory Peck plays a small-town lawyer named Sam Bowden, whose life is turned upside down after a man he testified against is released from prison after 8 years, and decides on a relentless and vicious campaign of revenge against him. The man named Max Cady(Robert Mitchum, highly effective) targets Sam's family chiefly his wife and daughter, escalating things from insinuation to murdering the family dog, forcing Sam to take direct action against him, though Max, who has had lots of time to study the law, uses it against him. Effective and chilling thriller is well directed by J. Lee Thompson, and features a clever and provocative script that pushed the limits for its time. Max Cady is one of cinema's most evil villains, and builds much suspense to its exciting climax.

    Maybe it is because the movie is a little bit old, I am not too attracted by it. However I appreciate the plays of the two gentleman. As a father and husband Sam expresses what a real responsible man should react and act. He shows his anger his impulse as well as his courage, all of which are what a real world man should react when he come across the same situation. His foe Max also deserves applaus. Maybe he is a good man in reality or maybe not as an badass as he played in the picture. What I want to say is that Max you are indeed an asshole. I will have no idea but kill him only if I met a badass as him. Another thing found from the film is that the law sometimes is really useless. At beginning I had kinds of ideas to deal with the guy, however along with the movie, none of the ideas worked. Police have no idea, law can not fetch the badass even sometime it protects him. So my last idea is let him disappear in other word kill him. I heard that in American if you shoot a guy in your house or you yard, you don't need to pay anything by law. Similarly, Sam made a trap for Max and wanted to kill him out of law. Not everything went good, to make the film more attractive, Sam chose a cape to set the trap which I think is a very stupid idea, but this time it works. It's not a trill one if you just watch it as a movie, however you cannot fall asleep if you bring it to reality.

    - A This has some of the best suspense I have ever seen in a movie from the first time we see the stalker to the climax of the showdown. Gregory Peck is very good as the lawyer and father and Robert Mitchum is very creepy as the stalker. Whenever there is suspense, it is intense and last as your heart is racing and anticipating what will happen next. Mitchum is able to keep the creepiness going throughout the whole film and is does good at playing innocent. The characters are very good and the story is very well done and this is just a very entertaining thriller. A perfect film for a thriving audience looking for a great film.

    Cape Fear is in North Carolina, so how did this movie end up being set in Georgia? I know the exteriors were filmed in Savannah, but Wilmington would have worked just as well (it's a center for film production today and doesn't look radically different from Savannah). In the scene where Sam Bowden is supposed to fly to Atlanta for his disbarment hearing, he should be on a plane to Raleigh. The Bowdens' boat's license should begin with NC instead of GA. On another note, don't forget that this was not the last time Robert Mitchum and Polly Bergen worked together; they would play husband and wife in "The Winds Of War" miniseries some two decades hence.

    I adore Robert Mitchum. The man was one of the most gifted actors of his generation...and unfortunately one of the most under-appreciated as well. His performance as Max Cady has given us one of the most terrifying and believably evil characters in the history of cinema. The only other character that comes close is Harry Powell in Night of The Hunter...again, Mitchum. The man is brilliant. Period. The foil to Cady's evil is Sam Bowden. Gregory Peck is, of course, brilliant in the role of the lawyer whose family is being terrorized by a man he sent up the river years ago, who has just been released from jail. Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

Polly Bergen is equally brilliant as the tough as nails wife of Bowden. In fact, she steals the show in the final scenes! This movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and doesn't let up for a moment. One of the best thrillers ever made.

    The greats often borrow from the greats. With just as much skill and style, J. Lee Thompson directs a nail-biter with obvious influence from Hitchcock, and there is a repeated musical phrase that propels one scene transition, which bears a striking resemblance to John Williams' shark theme from his score for Jaws. The only element in Cape Fear that is more menacing than Herrmann's score is the Max Cady character, played so convincingly by Robert Mitchum. Cady has strolled into town after shedding an eight-year prison sentence for which he blames lawyer Sam Bowden, who testified as a witness to Cady's crime against an innocent woman. Gregory Peck plays Bowden with his usual upstanding strength and conviction. Polly Bergen plays Bowden's wife, Peggy, and Lori Martin plays his daughter, Nancy. Both women deliver realistically superb performances. Their terror is as convincing as Mitchum's depiction of Cady's cool, calculating wrath and utter disregard for anything wholesome or decent. That disregard, as filtered through the magnetic, prismatic persona of Max Cady, becomes a mixed source of sociopathic repulsion and base, animalistic attraction. Cady threatens with a glint in his eye. When we first meet Cady, he is making his way through town toward the courthouse. Up the steps to the entrance, he nearly wrenches his neck checking out the rear end of a woman walking by. Inside, an unmasked look on his face reveals pure disdain for this building and everything it represents. He makes his way up another flight of stairs, this time past a woman who drops a stack of books, and he doesn't miss a stepnot even a flicker of altruistic consideration. In a world of rules and laws, political correctness, and social posturing, that sort of naked, individualistic honesty is refreshing, like an open icebox on a hot, Summer day; but stand there long enough, and eventually you'll feel a chill. Scarier than a scoundrel after your family is one with an intellect. We discover that during his prison stay, Cady studied the law, and he plans to use it against Bowden. In the face of Bowden's dour pontificating and as the game of one-upmanship escalates, we almost find ourselves rooting for Cady to exact his ironic revenge, as he deflects even lawless acts of deterrence from the lawmanuntil we reach the final showdown, discover Cady's twisted plan, and realize of what evil he is really made.

    Life was invaluable for the Bowden family; wonderful husband, father, beautiful wife and daughter, well-known lawyer, beautiful home ideal for the picture perfect family. But that picture slowly began to fade, when an animal by the name Max Cady (Robert Mitchum) had been released from jail. Eight years spent behind bars only to blame Sam Bowden (Gregory Peck) for testifying against him in court. Sam Bowden witnessed Cady attack a young woman. For that, Cady spent a portion of his life behind bars. Cady was no fool he utilized his time and resources wisely while incarcerated, and studied the rules of law thoroughly. With that new found knowledge he composed an ingenious plan. For those 8 years spent behind bars Cady did not let the conviction of the attack move onward, until he sought out revenge on a key witness Sam Bowden, who had played a key role in his sentence. Sam Bowden knew that life for his wife Peggy Bowden (Polly Bergen), and daughter Nancy Bowden (Lori Martin) were no longer going to be comfortable. This nasty, malicious creature had been placed back into society. With Max Cady released from jail, there would only be trepidation of just when Max Cady will strike. "Cape Fear" (1962) is an absolute classic. The roles in the film were phenomenal despite the lack of gore we would have suspected, with such a suspenseful storyline. It is a real commendable drama from start to finish. The acting from each individual actor and actress throughout the film were well developed. My adrenalin rose every time Cady crept on both Peggy and Nancy. Each act were well played out, and made you feel the intensity as if you were there. In the film you witness the physiological aspect with Max Cady. This was displayed in the very beginning of the film, in the scene where Sam Bowden and Max Cady were in the courtroom. That very moment we witness the physiological/mental issues with Max Cady in a very distinctive way. Anger, heartless, helplessness, darkness, hates towards women, and torture is what director J.Lee Thompson portrayed throughout the film.

    The only thing I found truly impressive about the (slightly overrated) "The Night of the Hunter" was the supremely evil performance of Robert Mitchum And he does it again here! Although "Cape Fear" definitely isn't a masterpiece in terms of scripting or concept originality, Mitchum almost single-handedly boosts up the overall quality level of the film with his mesmerizing performance. His legendary villainous character Max Cady is almost too despicable, disturbing and hateful to put into words. He's an intelligent and controlled psychopath, but also an immoral misogynist and pervert. The tension and anguish increases with 200% every single time he appears in a sequence and his charisma and evil ideas pretty much embody the deepest fears of every normal human being on this planet. Robert Mitchum truly was a terrific actor and he played villainous roles like no other actor ever could (and they probably didn't even dare to play the roles Mitchum did). The plot of "Cape Fear" is, as stated already, rather rudimentary and straightforward. Max Cady stalks and extracts vengeance on the honorable attorney Sam Bowden and his model family, as his testimony sentenced Cady to an 8 year prison sentence for assault. During his stay in jail, Cady didn't just develop a profound hatred against Sam Bowden; he also practiced law studies and thus always comes up with frustratingly intelligent ways to terrorize the Bowden family, yet without ever doing something illegal. And when Max Cady does commit a crime, like physically assailing a naive young girl, he makes sure that she's too petrified to testify against him. Cady's non-stop malfeasance and intimidating presence force Sam Bowden  usually a firm believer in the juridical system  to take matters into his own hand. The script of "Cape Fear" is adapted from a novel with the deliciously enticing title "The Executioners". I haven't read the book myself, but I imagine that author John D. MacDonald was more than satisfied with the transfer of his story to film, and particularly pleased with how his relentless main character became personified in the shape of Robert Mitchum. Of course, I cannot claim that the brilliance of "Cape Fear" entirely relies on Robert Mitchum exclusively Although very simplistic, the plot remains captivating at all times equally thanks to the eerie Southern Bayou filming locations (you can practically feel the heat and smell the characters' sweat) and Bernard Herrmann's unsettling and pounding musical score. Director J. Lee Thompson, also infamous for nearly a dozen of brainless but excessively violent Charles Bronson action vehicles, delivers here what is unquestionably his most stylish and integer accomplishment. Gregory Peck is also outstanding, but sadly the roles of Polly Bergen (as the wife) and Lori Martin (as the daughter) are somewhat pushed to the background. I guess it wasn't yet the era for profound and forceful female protagonists. Their roles, as well as various other minor sub plots, are far more elaborated in the 1991 Martin Scorsese remake. "Cape Fear" is a definite suspense thriller must see classic and  once again  Robert Michum's performance is one that you're not likely to forget for as long as you live.

    Robert Mitchum is one of the most underrated actors in the history of Hollywood. The guy was so damn cool. The original Cape Fear; in black and white, is the better of the two. Mitchum is Max Cady, and he is released from prison after serving an eight year sentence for rape. He blames a lawyer, Sam Bowden, for his conviction, and finds him living with his family. He kills the family dog, but Sam can't prove it and hires a detective, Charlie(Telly Savalas) to help him out. His friend, Mark Dutton is a police chief, but he is also unable to pin anything on Cady, including an assault on a woman by the ex-con, as she refuses to testify against him. Fed up with the law, Sam hires three thugs to beat Cady, but he is able to injure all of them. He vows to have the lawyer disbarred. Bowden takes his wife and 14 year old daughter to his houseboat on Cape Fear to set a trap in order to kill Cady. Mitchum and Peck are superb in the two lead roles, but I was not crazy about the ending. I would recommend Cape Fear just to watch these two actors at the top of their game.

    Not till the last minute did you actually know what the ending would be. It was that tense and the setting was fittingly eery. The capable Gregory Peck was, in this movie, a crux between the astute, calm, caring, respected small-town lawyer know as Atticus Finch ("To Kill A Mockingbird") and Lewt McCanles, the mean, spoiled son of a land baron in Texas ("Duel in The Sun"). As the lawyer Sam Bowden in "Cape Fear", he is a low-keyed lawyer who is none-the-less a courageous man. Robert Mitchum as the mean dreg Cady is as mean as mean can be, caring nothing about Bowden and his family. Bowden's wife is played well by Polly Bergen, and Lori Martin showed great acting ability as the scared, stalked daughter of Bowden. Telly Savalas did a good turn as the detective as well. The swamp in the movie strongly contributed to the eery feeling, and the music and occasionally-slow action made the movie tense. While it may not be among the most outstanding productions in which Mitchum and Peck played, it was another one of those I could see again.
