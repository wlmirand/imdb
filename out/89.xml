    Is Tyrell a God? Are Roy Batty (Anti-christ) and Deckard (Christ) his son? Why is Deckard fixed with the photographs of his own life? What is the reason why he did not respond when asked if he ever passed the Voight-Kampff machine test? Who is Pris waiting for covered by a veil? What is the verdant land and faultless is this where Deckard and Rachael seek refuge? Do Replicants have soul that flies like a dove at death? It is issues like these (but there are many more) that make people see and review the movie. Whether the mystery is sensed or not, it's there, a small voice that says - you have seen, but not seen. Blade Runner is a movie that will never be forgotten, for the simple reason that it will never be revealed.

    What can be said about Blade Runner that hasn't already been said? There is the period of time before Blade Runner, and there is the period after Blade Runner. Thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant directing, this plot of a man hunting down a group of rouge human replicants is brilliantly paced so that you never get bored. There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals. A true piece of art, Blade Runner is something that every human on the planet should watch.

    On the sparingly, almost esoteric introduction sounds of Vangelis, we discover that we find ourselves in Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called "off-world colonies". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The "Blade Runners", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them. This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity. Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's "Final Cut" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before. It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone "what makes a human human?" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece.

    So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say. Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is. It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.

    I have to say that the plot is compelling and the thought processes placed in the story are deep, profound and thought-provoking. However... yes, my dear Readers, there is a however: Several intricate portions of the movie ruined it for me in a severe way. First off, I am not a fan of the make-up artistry of the time. They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on. The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them. Poorly made, even for the time. Like I said, the plot is good, with the thought processes behind the movie quite strong. But plot isn't the only thing in a movie, and when those are at fault, the whole film suffers. 3-5 out of 10.

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

(And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    Is Tyrell a God? Are Roy Batty (Anti-christ) and Deckard (Christ) his son? Why is Deckard fixed with the photographs of his own life? What is the reason why he did not respond when asked if he ever passed the Voight-Kampff machine test? Who is Pris waiting for covered by a veil? What is the verdant land and faultless is this where Deckard and Rachael seek refuge? Do Replicants have soul that flies like a dove at death? It is issues like these (but there are many more) that make people see and review the movie. Whether the mystery is sensed or not, it's there, a small voice that says - you have seen, but not seen. Blade Runner is a movie that will never be forgotten, for the simple reason that it will never be revealed.

    What can be said about Blade Runner that hasn't already been said? There is the period of time before Blade Runner, and there is the period after Blade Runner. Thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant directing, this plot of a man hunting down a group of rouge human replicants is brilliantly paced so that you never get bored. There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals. A true piece of art, Blade Runner is something that every human on the planet should watch.

    On the sparingly, almost esoteric introduction sounds of Vangelis, we discover that we find ourselves in Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called "off-world colonies". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The "Blade Runners", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them. This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity. Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's "Final Cut" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before. It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone "what makes a human human?" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece.

    So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say. Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is. It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.

    I have to say that the plot is compelling and the thought processes placed in the story are deep, profound and thought-provoking. However... yes, my dear Readers, there is a however: Several intricate portions of the movie ruined it for me in a severe way. First off, I am not a fan of the make-up artistry of the time. They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on. The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them. Poorly made, even for the time. Like I said, the plot is good, with the thought processes behind the movie quite strong. But plot isn't the only thing in a movie, and when those are at fault, the whole film suffers. 3-5 out of 10.

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    What can be said about Blade Runner that hasn't already been said? There is the period of time before Blade Runner, and there is the period after Blade Runner. Thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant directing, this plot of a man hunting down a group of rouge human replicants is brilliantly paced so that you never get bored. There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals. A true piece of art, Blade Runner is something that every human on the planet should watch.

    On the sparingly, almost esoteric introduction sounds of Vangelis, we discover that we find ourselves in Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called "off-world colonies". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The "Blade Runners", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them. This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity. Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's "Final Cut" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before. It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone "what makes a human human?" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece.

    So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say. Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is. It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.

    I have to say that the plot is compelling and the thought processes placed in the story are deep, profound and thought-provoking. However... yes, my dear Readers, there is a however: Several intricate portions of the movie ruined it for me in a severe way. First off, I am not a fan of the make-up artistry of the time. They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on. The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them. Poorly made, even for the time. Like I said, the plot is good, with the thought processes behind the movie quite strong. But plot isn't the only thing in a movie, and when those are at fault, the whole film suffers. 3-5 out of 10.

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    Is Tyrell a God? Are Roy Batty (Anti-christ) and Deckard (Christ) his son? Why is Deckard fixed with the photographs of his own life? What is the reason why he did not respond when asked if he ever passed the Voight-Kampff machine test? Who is Pris waiting for covered by a veil? What is the verdant land and faultless is this where Deckard and Rachael seek refuge? Do Replicants have soul that flies like a dove at death? It is issues like these (but there are many more) that make people see and review the movie. Whether the mystery is sensed or not, it's there, a small voice that says - you have seen, but not seen. Blade Runner is a movie that will never be forgotten, for the simple reason that it will never be revealed.

    What can be said about Blade Runner that hasn't already been said? There is the period of time before Blade Runner, and there is the period after Blade Runner. Thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant directing, this plot of a man hunting down a group of rouge human replicants is brilliantly paced so that you never get bored. There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals. A true piece of art, Blade Runner is something that every human on the planet should watch.

    On the sparingly, almost esoteric introduction sounds of Vangelis, we discover that we find ourselves in Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called "off-world colonies". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The "Blade Runners", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them. This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity. Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's "Final Cut" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before. It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone "what makes a human human?" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece.

    So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say. Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is. It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.

    I have to say that the plot is compelling and the thought processes placed in the story are deep, profound and thought-provoking. However... yes, my dear Readers, there is a however: Several intricate portions of the movie ruined it for me in a severe way. First off, I am not a fan of the make-up artistry of the time. They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on. The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them. Poorly made, even for the time. Like I said, the plot is good, with the thought processes behind the movie quite strong. But plot isn't the only thing in a movie, and when those are at fault, the whole film suffers. 3-5 out of 10.

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    What can be said about Blade Runner that hasn't already been said? There is the period of time before Blade Runner, and there is the period after Blade Runner. Thanks to Ridley Scott's brilliant directing, this plot of a man hunting down a group of rouge human replicants is brilliantly paced so that you never get bored. There is always something visually stunning on screen 24/7, in my opinion the best part of Blade Runner is not its smart script, great story, or Oscar performances, it's the film's gorgeous and breathtaking visuals. A true piece of art, Blade Runner is something that every human on the planet should watch.

    On the sparingly, almost esoteric introduction sounds of Vangelis, we discover that we find ourselves in Los Angeles, 2019. Humanity has produced a race of robots (replicants) who are, apart from emotions, identical to humans. They serve to perform slave labor in the so called "off-world colonies". But the robots seemed a little too human and turned against their makers, by which they became a threat. The "Blade Runners", a special unit of the government, were assigned to identify these replicants and eliminate them. This is the synopsis of Blade Runner, a masterpiece by Ridley Scott from 1982. It's superior cast of people who are determined to transcend themselves is key to make an instant classic. The blue eyes, blonde hair and grimace from ear to ear of Rutger Hauer made him the ultimate ice-cold replicant, while Harrison Ford, after Star Wars and Raiders Of The Lost Ark, proved his ability to present a complex and morally charged character. The role of composer Vangelis was also of great importance. He created a delicious and almost Spartan sober sound-scape, which echoed the perfect cries of an unhinged future. And what would the movie have been without the miraculous special effects of wizard Douglas Trumbull, the man who had polished 2001: A Space Odyssey for all eternity. Upon release, the movie turned out to be a flop, but not for long. When the picture first appeared on video, it rapidly gained a cult-status held to date. We are fortunate to behold Ridley's "Final Cut" version where, for the very first time, the dream of the unicorn can be seen the way it was meant to be. The sparingly but intense violence is no longer trimmed and the digital polishing makes the picture shine more beautifully and confident than ever before. It is hard not to be intrigued by the surprisingly philosophical overtone "what makes a human human?" Let yourself be dragged in by this classic science-fiction masterpiece.

    So this is based of the book "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?", and yet there are not even any electric sheep in it! What happened to all the symbolism? I feel like they just excavated the substance from the book, and just made an empty robot-hunting movie. It was a very clinical approach to a movie which may have otherwise had something to say. Now, I'm not suggesting you go read the book, which isn't even good, but at least it tried to be about something, unlike this movie, which just doesn't & isn't. Isn't about anything, that is. It amazes me how this movie can secure such a high rating. My gosh! Oh, well, on second thought, maybe there are sheep in this movie after all. And they're in the audience.

    I have to say that the plot is compelling and the thought processes placed in the story are deep, profound and thought-provoking. However... yes, my dear Readers, there is a however: Several intricate portions of the movie ruined it for me in a severe way. First off, I am not a fan of the make-up artistry of the time. They simply try too hard to make the movie 'look ' futuristic, and fail miserably. The effects were poor, obviously, as a person spoiled by the effects to be found in movies nowadays. The fights are poorly choreographed, with more emphasis on the witty quips and dialogue instead of the fight going on. The acting is also very poor. The dialogue is very unstable, the conversations between two characters feeling like both have a bad stuttering problem. I have seen Harrison Ford make good movies, and this is not one of them. Poorly made, even for the time. Like I said, the plot is good, with the thought processes behind the movie quite strong. But plot isn't the only thing in a movie, and when those are at fault, the whole film suffers. 3-5 out of 10.

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982). Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion. Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling. In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film. Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film. 10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)

    Writer Philip K. Dick posed the question: "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" It seems like an odd thing to ask, but it puts into context the question of what it means to be human; does a human analog, like and android, mimic human behaviour in it's own terms? If life is electric, as opposed to bio-chemical, will that life see other life only as being equally electric? Blade Runner takes Dick's novel "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?" and examines that concept. Set in a dark future in which robots are visually indistinguishable from humans, it forces us to ask what it is to be truly human; does humanity require a physical body that is exactly the same as ours, or is our true essence found in the mind and the choices we make? In Blade Runner we encounter military grade androids that are so highly developed, they don't know that they are not human. Or at least they aren't supposed to. At least one of these above average beings seems to develop a strong sense of self and self-preservation that is beyond what the programmer intended. As a result, these automata behave rather badly; it is up to Blade Runner Harrison Ford to stop them. This is where the line between humanity and android begins to blur. Who is more human? The Blade Runner sent to stop the Androids from running amok, or the androids that seek only to live as best they can? Where does the heart truly lie? Is it in only in the soul of a flesh and blood person born of man and woman, or is it possible that even a factory made robot can develop a sense of good, evil and morality that is indistinguishable from that of the human it imitates? Blade Runner explores those questions in a way that combines excellent story telling and taut direction. It is an excellent film.

    This is the one for which Ridley Scott should be remembered, a combination of Philip K. Dick's novel and Lester del Ray's short story, HELEN O'LOY. Certainly, few sf films have looked half as good: the smoky, rain-misted NOIR visuals put to shame most of what's been done in the genre and the Vangelis music is some of the most moving I've ever heard (and it wouldn't have hurt to have had MORE of it throughout). Harrison Ford is at the very top of his game, here, and it's highly unlikely that Sean Young will ever be this beautiful again. (And, just for the record, I think SHE should've been Catwoman in the second of Tim Burton's BATMAN films. That one, it seems to me, should've been a real no-brainer...) Scott's high-water mark.

    BLADE RUNNER: DIRECTOR'S CUT This is the third time I have seen this film. I originally watched it about 20 years ago on VHS... I hated it. I then forgot most of the movie and watched it again about 10 years ago... I hated it. Again I forgot the whole movie... the only thing I remembered about this film was that I hated it. But a friend from work told me that it is a classic and it is his favourite film of all time. I know this movie is highly regarded by so many movie fans and finally I am starting to see why. I really enjoyed it. The story is about a retired Blade Runner (a cop who is assigned to find and kill replicants) who is forced to come out of retirement to find 4 escaped replicants. A replicant is a human clone designed and created for use in colonies as slaves with a 4 year life span. These 4 replicants have made their way to Earth to find their maker to try and make their lives longer. The story is very good. It is based on a book called "Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep" and is made really well. The visuals of this is amazing. I loved the futuristic look and the landscapes were beautiful. It has an awesome 80s feel to it which is one of the best feelings in a movie for me. There are still talks of a sequel to this film which I think would be a mistake. It is not the 80s anymore and that is one of the things that made this great. The new one would feel too modern and would just not have the same effect... just like Star Wars episodes 1-3. The films starred Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos, Daryl Hannah & M. Emmet Walsh. Everyone did a great job. Especially Rutger. He has a real creepy look about him that I feel he brings to most of the roles he has played. I loved the toys that the character Sebastian made. I thought they were a fantastic part of this movie and really helped to make the movie more fun. I did find that the movie was slow in places... there were quite a few scenes where there was a lot of thinking and just looking. And the blues/jazz soundtrack was not the greatest... but it kind of felt right with the mood of the film. The film was made by Ridley Scott who is a genius with Sci-Fi films as we know seeing Alien and more recently Prometheus. Ridley is a legend and I hope me makes more movies soon. Ridley is also apparently lined up to direct the new Blade Runner film... whether it be a sequel or remake... no-one knows as of yet. I will give this film 7 out of 10... which is really good seeing as before watching it this time, based on the last 2 times of seeing it, I would have given it 2 out of 10. "More human than human is our motto." For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl
