    This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..

    In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.

    This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..

    In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears.

The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally?

Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.

    This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..

    In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.

    This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..

    In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years.

Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.

    This film is the kind of film that has a very interesting topic and a very original idea, but leaves us with a certain feeling of disappointment and that we wished more. The way it is filmed, the dialogues, the characters and the actors are pretty much standard, not original. I'd say the first half of the movie is even uninteresting. Another bad point is the music I'd say, which is just omnipresent in the movie. And this is one of the aspects of the movies (especially American ones) that annoys me. When it looks like they try to control our emotions by putting dramatic music in the action scenes and quiet tunes in love scenes. I hesitated a long moment if I would put a six or a seven on this movie. Because I just love the plot and the second half of the movie. At this point the story gets so much interesting and mysterious. I think they could have done a way, way better film with this plot. Oh and by the way the ending is just ridiculous, when they hold their hands and kinda 'pray', I was like: oh my god, this is just WRONG..

    In the middle of the South Pacific, a thousand feet below the surface of the water, a huge vessel rests on the ocean floor. Rushed to the scene is a group of American scientists who descend to the depths of the sea to investigate this astonishing discovery. What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong.

What they find defies their imaginations and mocks their attempts at logical explanation. It is a massive spaceship, undamaged from it's fall from the sky-and at least three hundred years old..... Three great stars, a wonderful director, and an interesting concept with a sort of Event Horizon and Solaris hybrid, sounded wonderful. And while its watchable for its lengthy duration, it never really hits the heights it aims for. Everybody is influenced by the Sphere, and they start to manipulate the environment, with Sea Serpents, Jellyfish, and even books. Now the main problem with this movie is that it was released too soon after Event Horizon, and instead of going all deep and mystical, also known as catering for the masses, and going for the scares instead, and makes a mockery of itself. So instead of it being an enthralling thriller with brains, we get a half hearted science fiction horror with a wonderful cast, which makes it strangely watchable. Any film that has Dustin Hoffman and Samuel L Jackson talking science versus religion one minute, and then fighting their imaginations the next, has to be watched. And the ending is ridiculous, the three stars literally hold hands and forget the whole movie. They actually do that.....

    OK, so I watched this movie last night and I couldn't leave the room or turn of the TV (although I was very sleepy) until it was over. The thing is, it kept me up and I kept it in my head even after it was over. For me, the action was predictable here and there. In the first part, I could swear it would turn into that kind of a movie where a group of people start a journey together and, one by one, they get killed, in the end to remain only the main characters, that find a way to survive miraculously, get rescued and go back to their lives. Also, one thing I could predict was when Norman discovers that the "alien" was actually named "Harry", not "Jerry". Then, my guessing came true, Harry was the one who created the disasters. Remember those cartoons where someone created monsters during sleep and had to be kept awake, or the ones in which they faced monsters that weren't actually real, but were made by their imagination? I used to love those cartoons. Just the way I love this movie. What's to love about them is the thing that it explores the human mind, the power of imagination, the thing that happens when people face their fears. Everyone has a fear, even if they don't admit it. What would happen if everyone could bring their fear to life? Scary thought, huh? Another thing I liked about it was the logic it worked on, the suspense, and the way that action is combined every now and then are funny lines which relax the situation like " Interviewer: I see you have a scar on your neck. Beth: Car accident. Interviewer: Were you drinking? Beth: Yeah - but I wasn't driving." or "Barnes: Ask him for his last name. Harry: What? Barnes: I want a full name for my report. I'm not putting in my report that I lost a crew member on a deep-sat expedition to find an alien named "Jerry." " Overall, it's not an Oscar nominee, but it's watchable, not only for the SciFi lovers, but for any viewer who wants that kind of movie that keeps him in front of the screen.

    Sphere is a science-fiction/horror film based on the book by Michael Crichton of the same title. Now, I have not read the book, but in my opinion films based on books or vice versa should not be compared to the source material. Reading the book makes you prejudiced against the picture. It's either better or worse than the book, you don't judge the film as an independent work. Sphere is about a team of scientists who are gathered by the US government to investigate a mysterious spaceship found at the bottom of the pacific ocean. It soon transpires that the ship has been there for more than 300 years. As they explore it they discover a mysterious sphere, and as they study it strange things start to happen. I won't spoil the story too much, but there is a really interesting concept here involving time travel and first contact with alien technology, and they completely ruined it. Soon after they discover the sphere the plot descends into complete nonsense and remains that way until the end. The acting on the other hand is superb, not that you could expect any less from an all star cast with Dustin Hoffman, Samuel L. Jackson and Sharon Stone. The characters are well developed and the drama is believable. Sphere is a tense film, and despite the dissatisfying plot it keeps you watching and there are some good jump moments. The editing is done well and the underwater cinematography is great. All in all sphere is a film that, in my opinion, has a plot with a lot of potential that gets lost halfway through, but remains enjoyable though good direction and solid acting. If you like sci-fi horror and are looking for something a little different I suggest you give this a try.

    First let me say that Barry Levinson succeeds where others have failed. For instance, he has succeeded in making Sharon Stone appear to have no sex appeal. Even more impressive he has succeeded in making Samuel L Jackson appear anaemic. This is really a terrible film on the whole though it does have a few redeeming features, so let's look at them first. The claustrophobia of being locked up in a tin can at the bottom of the sea is invoked very convincingly, much better than the Abyss or old episodes of Stingray. Sharon Stone does play against type and does well considering the material. The opening sequence and the military involvement are handled quite well. The score is very effective even though it's highly derivative of the music from Aliens. On the other hand.. the plot is awful, Dustin Hoffman plays Dustin Hoffman character-acting a mad psychologist, the effects are truly crappy for 1998, the monsters aren't very monstrous, the ending is naff, the colour is weird and grainy (OK, maybe that's deliberate but I didn't like it). And that's just for starters. Oh yes, you might want to know what it's about. Let me just say spacecraft at bottom of the sea, crack team of experts in something or other, storms at sea, lost contact with the surface ship, paranoia, death and the effects of a long-finished relationship. Got it? Please avoid the next bit if you don't like spoilers. So, how come a team specialising in techniques for dealing with first alien contact spend some hours baffled by the fact that streams of numbers keep scrolling past on the computer screen and that they don't seem to be generated internally? DOH! And then, how come they take precisely 1 second to crack the conceptually difficult code? One critic I read suggested that this film is a cheap rate version of Solaris. He (or she) was wrong. This film is actually a cheap rate version of Forbidden Planet. Solaris was a very subtle exploration of how human psychology can be affected by alien intelligence. Forbidden Planet was about monsters from the id. Sphere is somewhat less satisfying than Forbidden Planet because the latter had robots, romance and good special effects even though it was made decades earlier. And I think my friend the Cheshire Cat has stopped speaking to me because it was my idea to go and see Sphere in the first place.

    I watched it today. Didn't read any of the reviews here, except for the rating. For 1998 film, its fantastic. For starters, the cast is decent, characters are carefully crafted. I wont dwell into the story part too much as many people have said a lot about it. I really wanted to see some explosive stuff, but once it picked up steam, there wasn't any, but the timing of the events made it worth watching. The sphere was beautifully picturized. I wish they took us inside the sphere for once but they didn't... And that i would say scuffed a little. Go watch it, there are some questionable points, like American almonds, who set the bomb, why the ship is still alive after 300 years. But this one takes us to a place never before - Manifestations...

    I have written about this film in the past under another moniker, and decided to give it another go under my current name. "Sphere," which tanked at the box office, is an adaptation of a Michael Crichton novel about a mysterious object found in a spaceship at the bottom of the ocean. Dustin Hoffman plays a shrink who is enlisted by the government, in the form of Peter Coyote, to lead a team to examine the spaceship. Once inside, they find the stranger artifact, a simple sphere. What they find in time is that the thing allows those who come into contact with it to manifest their thoughts into reality. Nuff said about the plot. The first half of the movie is pretty entertaining, as we only know what the shrink and his team know. The second half is an utter dog. Looks like they rushed production, scrimped on the special effects, and generally made a mess of what might been another "2001." Hoffman is all wrong for his role, and Sharon Stone as his ex-wife and fellow explorer is also miscast. A better movie on a similar theme is Anderson's "Event Horizon," which unfortunately also suffers from a weak second half. I'd even recommend Cameron's "The Abyss" over this, as long as you don't mind sitting through a movie that is longer than necessary.

    The psychiatrist Dr. Norman Goodman (Dustin Hoffman) travels from San Diego to the middle of nowhere in the Pacific Ocean to help survivors of a plane crash. Soon he learns that he was actually summoned by Captain Harold C. Barnes (Peter Coyote) to team-up with the biochemistry Dr. Elizabeth 'Beth' Halperin (Sharon Stone); the mathematician Dr. Harry Adams (Samuel L. Jackson); and the astrophysical Dr. Ted Fielding (Liev Schreiber) to investigate an unknown life form in a spacecraft that crashed two hundred and eighty-eight years ago. The team saturates with helium to travel to a base close to the UFO 1,000 feet below the ocean and operated by the military Alice 'Teeny' Fletcher (Queen Latifah) and Jane Edmunds (Marga G&oacute;mez). Barnes, Norman, Beth, Harry and Ted go to the spaceship and discover that it is terrestrial from the future. Further, the computer indicates an Unknown Entry Event, probably a Black Hole that brought the spaceship to the past. Harry uses logic and concludes that if the crew had never heard anything about their discovery in the present days, they will probably dies. But they all are intrigued with a mysterious sphere inside the spacecraft. There is a storm in the surface and the fleet must leave the area, leaving Barnes and his team without communication. Harry sneaks out and enters in the sphere and then his manifestations come to life threatening the group. Will they survive to the power of the mysterious sphere? I saw "Sphere" on the late 90's but I did not like it. Yesterday I saw it again, now on DVD, and this time I found it a sci-fi with an intelligent story but with a terrible direction. The greatest problem are the characters that are unpleasant, unlikable and emotionally detached and without feelings. The situation of the fleet leaving the area due to a storm but without leaving a submarine in the area to give support to the group is also a great flaw in the story. This screenplay in the hands of Spielberg or James Cameron could have been a great film. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): "Esfera" ("Sphere")

    'Sphere' is gripping, chilling watch that presents an interesting idea laced with dark dread. The movie's setting 1000ft below sea level immediately gives it an otherworldly feel and a eerie foreboding. The film-making compliments and enhances the feel of the movie and an excellent main cast present a set of believable characters. Given that the movie is based on a book, ('Sphere' by Michael Crichton) the script is decent and it would interesting to see how the movie compares to the book, particularly with other decent adaptations of Crichtons books, e.g. Jurassic Park, in the ether. Pleasingly, initial impressions of alien encounters and time travel are squashed as the movie develops into a psychological thriller/horror that presents the ever-interesting investigation into the human psyche. The slightly more faint of heart may just find themselves switching on lights, locking doors, and cuddling up with a child-hood comfort after watching this and some will definitely be unnerved. I must confess that even after a few viewings I still come away from this feeling slightly edgy and that almost never happens with me. This gripping and chilling movie is a worthy addition to the ranks of other sci-fi horrors like 'Event Horizon' that I personally feel has been under-rated. It keeps you thoroughly interested and firmly in your seat throughout and for a few minutes after for fear of your own fears. It is a definite watch for all those who like their moves tense, eerie, and chilling.

    The first 30 minutes of this movie was compelling but after that it just fell flat. With all the new technology in the ship wouldn't 5 geniuses be a little more interested in what was inside? Not to mention the Sphere itself. With something so interesting you think the director would want to titillate us a little with its powers. Did anyone else notice how emotionally detached the characters were? After every tragedy that included deaths of supposed friends, there just sitting around sipping coffee trying to figure out what happened all the while, smiling!? This really could have been a great movie, its got all the elements. The director just blew it.
