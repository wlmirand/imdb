    Really, one of my most appreciated and thought-provoking MOVIE picture of the last 20 years ... !? The screenplay &/or textual rendition/wording is just 'beyond' appreciation ... nor superficial understating ...; The whole 'spirit' of the STORY is in the characters' loss of appreciation for their being/presence , at this time of history, ... in this factual societal awareness ... ; they are just at a loss for justifying their consciousness of, their very-short lived, presence into this TIME lapsed (sic) awareness odd presence ... !? Bluntly, or straight-forwardly put, these dialogues are some of the most challenging I have encountered since some/most of the last 20 years ... ! Should you be looking for a thought-provoking, and challenging OPUS , to your better appreciated MOVIE experience, this NAKED item should do, wholesomely, totally, the works' ... ; So much fine-tuned, realistic, true-sounding, factual, ... trustful !?!

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him . Another character which comes alongside johnny in a more sadistic venture is Jeremey the landlord , though he goes by other names played by "Greg Cruttwell" , he is above everyone financial , and is a playboy type figure who owns everything that is needed , he is the upside of a forgotten realm of poverty , he's evil but with the cash too do so . The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him . Another character which comes alongside johnny in a more sadistic venture is Jeremey the landlord , though he goes by other names played by "Greg Cruttwell" , he is above everyone financial , and is a playboy type figure who owns everything that is needed , he is the upside of a forgotten realm of poverty , he's evil but with the cash too do so . The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him . Another character which comes alongside johnny in a more sadistic venture is Jeremey the landlord , though he goes by other names played by "Greg Cruttwell" , he is above everyone financial , and is a playboy type figure who owns everything that is needed , he is the upside of a forgotten realm of poverty , he's evil but with the cash too do so . The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    Really, one of my most appreciated and thought-provoking MOVIE picture of the last 20 years ... !? The screenplay &/or textual rendition/wording is just 'beyond' appreciation ... nor superficial understating ...; The whole 'spirit' of the STORY is in the characters' loss of appreciation for their being/presence , at this time of history, ... in this factual societal awareness ... ; they are just at a loss for justifying their consciousness of, their very-short lived, presence into this TIME lapsed (sic) awareness odd presence ... !? Bluntly, or straight-forwardly put, these dialogues are some of the most challenging I have encountered since some/most of the last 20 years ... ! Should you be looking for a thought-provoking, and challenging OPUS , to your better appreciated MOVIE experience, this NAKED item should do, wholesomely, totally, the works' ... ; So much fine-tuned, realistic, true-sounding, factual, ... trustful !?!

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    Really, one of my most appreciated and thought-provoking MOVIE picture of the last 20 years ... !? The screenplay &/or textual rendition/wording is just 'beyond' appreciation ... nor superficial understating ...; The whole 'spirit' of the STORY is in the characters' loss of appreciation for their being/presence , at this time of history, ... in this factual societal awareness ... ; they are just at a loss for justifying their consciousness of, their very-short lived, presence into this TIME lapsed (sic) awareness odd presence ... !? Bluntly, or straight-forwardly put, these dialogues are some of the most challenging I have encountered since some/most of the last 20 years ... ! Should you be looking for a thought-provoking, and challenging OPUS , to your better appreciated MOVIE experience, this NAKED item should do, wholesomely, totally, the works' ... ; So much fine-tuned, realistic, true-sounding, factual, ... trustful !?!

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him . Another character which comes alongside johnny in a more sadistic venture is Jeremey the landlord , though he goes by other names played by "Greg Cruttwell" , he is above everyone financial , and is a playboy type figure who owns everything that is needed , he is the upside of a forgotten realm of poverty , he's evil but with the cash too do so . The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him .

The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie.

    Finally watched it. Mike Leigh's "Naked" is one of the most thematically disturbing and haunting movies you will ever come across. It tells the story of Johnny(Thewlis), a philosophical,world-weary drifter who is always on the run from the law. After committing a rape in Manchester, he lams to London to live at his former girlfriend's residence. Thereon, he again embarks on a surreal odyssey on the London streets meeting people as queer as himself. From answering questions as deeply rooted in theology and metaphysics;spitting out doomsday prophecies as some boardroom lecture to satisfying needs as banal as a hot-water bath and some sex, Johnny does it all here, on this trip. Director Leigh extracts performances verging on the edge of perfection from the entire cast and does so with superb improvisation which is quite evident,especially, in scenes that feature Johnny. Everyone is a knockout in the acting department, but,hey;then there is David Thewlis as Johnny. He delivers a portrayal that has shades of Hamlet,Jimmy Porter,even Jesus(a very sado-masochistic and cruel one at that). I say Jesus paradoxically because in a way Johnny wants to save mankind from the ignorance of believing we are not doomed and affirming that God has manipulated us(mankind) for the sake of some cosmic warfare. It is indeed a cynical and paradoxical second coming of Christ. Thewlis gave his 'naked' body and soul to this film by devouring almost every book about religion and eschatology as a part of role-preparation. he evokes time to time disgust,pity.hatred and wonder in his hauntingly mesmerizing performance. If you are looking for plot, there isn't any. Most of the film revolves around Johnny and his adventures. Fraught with existential overtones,it is a thunderous take by Leigh on the Thatcherite England which almost convinces viewers that it is a dystopian world we are living in; that apocalypse isn't far and we need something or somebody to awaken us from this nightmare.

    Naked is written and directed by Mike Leigh. It stars David Thewlis, Lesley Sharp, Katrin Cartlidge, Greg Cruttwell, Claire Skinner, Peter Wright, Ewen Bremner and Gina McKee. Music is by Andrew Dickinson and cinematography by Dick Pope. Johnny (Thewlis) is an unemployed wastrel who has to flee Manchester after indulging in his sexually violent proclivities. Heading for London to seek out an old girlfriend, Johnny encounters a number of people more hapless and lost than he is. Proles, Plebs and Potheads. Mike Leigh's brutal and raw character study remains as potent today as it was on release in post Thatcher Britain. Sometimes coined as a film for masochists or misogynists, Naked is actually for neither. For sure it isn't setting out to cheer you up, it's relentlessly restless and intense, it doesn't cut corners or operate under a banner of political convenience. Yet it does have intelligent depth to the point where the deeper you dig the more troubling Leigh's observations become. This allows Leigh and his brilliant cast to leave indelible images, to bring out themes that simply refuse to leave the conscious, where the observation of a society filled with sad, lonely and desperate people provides the discomfort of the human form stripped, well, naked. Ever seen a dead body? Only my own Johnny is an intellectual, an intelligent man, even charming, he can chat freely on the world and man's existence in it. But he has unhealthy appetites and a knack for latching onto emotional discord. Posit this with a backdrop of dirty streets, cheap caf&eacute;s and grungy flats, and there's a starkness about the narrative that scars the soul, aided considerably by Dickinson's edgy violin based score and Pope's stripped back colour photography. A concurrent character study with that of Johnny is that of Jeremy/Sebastian (Cruttwell), the definition of Yuppiedom gone wrong, the devil with a Filofax who is both cruel and predatory, he's the polar opposite of scruffy Johnny, but both represent a London that's far from the bright lights and big city so many hopeless dreamers set off in search of. A sick boy in search of Booze, Beans and a Bath. The Jeremy/Sebastian axis feels very much like satire, this also is something that makes Naked so strong, it is quite often funny. True, the humour here is clinical and comes in spiked barbs, but there are laughs to be had here, the kind that deftly dovetail with a pervading sense of bleakness, finding wit in the most unlikely of places. What is Leigh trying to say in all this? As usual he isn't offering up solutions to his questions, he demands you observe and respond, while he asks his actors to take the material and respond in kind, which they do, led by a quite extraordinary performance by Thewlis. Cannes agreed, awarding Thewlis with the Best Actor Award whilst also bestowing Leigh with the Best Director Award. Both were richly deserved. Never gratuitous, Naked is a sensitive and thoughtful film, yes it's tough to witness at times, it's meant to be, but this is a searing masterpiece that demands to be seen more than once. 10/10

    Mike Leigh is well known for being a typically British film-maker, that makes strongly British comedies, with a dark edge to them. But Naked is possibly his darkest, least comical film yet. Starring David Thewlis, Naked is the fruit of Leigh's more twisted, more existential side, although his other films are not completely lacking of these two characteristics. The film follows Johnny, a young man who flees from Manchester to London after having raped a girl. Arrived at his destined city, he stumbles into the apartment of one of his old girlfriends, where he meets and has sex with her roommate. That night, Johnny feels a sense of unbearable boredom and gets out on the streets of London, where he meets several characters, even more flawed than him. Beaten up by a group of kids, the following day he goes back into his ex-girlfriend's apartment, to find that a misogynist, Jeremy, has abruptly entered the household claiming to be the landowner, raped the roommate, and stayed for the night. Like it was previously mentioned, Leigh brings out a lot of existentialist themes for Naked, as it can be seen in the clever, rich dialogue, that doesn't lack its darkly funny moments (although a lot of it was written inspired by improvisations of the actors who already were familiar with their character's persona): David Thewlis playing Johnny gives a startling, fantastic performance, and is definitely the best constructed character of the entire movie. In trying to self-cleanse himself subconsciously, Johnny bullies intellectually every one he encounters, to feel some sense of superiority. He is already in an advantage, in the sense that all the people he meets are already extremely vulnerable emotionally, outsiders, withdrawn victims of the night. In the bulk of the film, (Johnny's nocturnal wanderings) the lighting has almost a Neo-Noir look, to remind us of the countless flaws we see in every single human being on screen, just like a classic Film Noir. Because of the long segments of the day before and day after, Naked is much more well- rounded than the typical one-night-odyssey movie (a movie, say, such as After Hours, by Martin Scorsese). During this time, so many topics, discussions, and themes are brought in the story, in the actions of the protagonist and in the dialogue. More than anything, Naked is a reflection on strong vs. weak, on how the position of the two are sometimes the opposite of what they seem.

    "Naked" is Mike Leigh's film about a reality in which character's refuse to function on a moral and reprehensible basis . The dilemma that starves the film is it's central character both protagonist / antagonist ..He starves it out of characteristic non values , he run's on auto pilot undermining his ordeal of hate and philosophy and moves on too more uncertainty . His name is "Johnny" and only that is what you have too live by , in terms of fully judging this film from the core and onwards. It's a brilliant film from start to finish . Leigh's approach to film is that of exploring a character and improvising situations that include that level of determination in the role . Lesley Sharp as "Louise" provides that candle of hope in the film that is barely even there , but you sense her rebellion to her lover "johnny" as a pair that had it's fights but the love affair goes unresolved , and seems one sided due too Johnny's ways that are nebulous and petty compared to the world's range of normal thinking . Katrin Cartlidge as Sophie remains too this day as the most damaged character in a Leigh film in my humble opinion . She's a severe drug addict , and through her own damaged persona , her good looks serve as a mask , and her true despair lies within the lies of men , and she trusts Johnny through spirit and wisdom , but only gets cold emotion and rejection driving her character into what most men refer too as "an overly dramatic breakup" . In reality its a damged soul , hurt by the savagery of a horrible soul . Johnny remains the central device for Thatcherism for all it's working class criminality, and for the common people to yell their voice via "Johnny rotten" "Mark E smith " ...He is educated but rejected in some form , sex too him gives him the upper hand in situations that otherwise would make him look weak ...he's a man that won't back down out of arrogance , and his BPD of deranged thoughts and manifestations of his quest ...whatever that brings too him . Another character which comes alongside johnny in a more sadistic venture is Jeremey the landlord , though he goes by other names played by "Greg Cruttwell" , he is above everyone financial , and is a playboy type figure who owns everything that is needed , he is the upside of a forgotten realm of poverty , he's evil but with the cash too do so . The true opposite of "Johnny" which they share the same hatreds but have different envy's , which makes johnny not an enemy of the story , but a sad one ..."Naked" is and still is the best film of it's era , it symbolizes the bitterness we all feel when the world has turned it's back on us , Johnny simply walks on into the void , what do we do ?

    The title of Mike Leigh's film "naked" does not describe a physical state but a state of mentality that the characters of the film face. These people have no jobs, no relationships, no families, and barely have an existence in a hyper realistic anarchy- a dark and bitter world created by the brilliant British director: mike Leigh. The film is set in a deeply depressing London. The characters we meet are so desperate and this is a desperate film. The hero is Jonnie, a 27 year old man who struggles to exist in the world he lives in. his desperation is one of the most devastating depictions of devastation I have ever seen on film. We first see him raping a woman and then stealing a car. What a brutal introduction to one of the most brutal relationships of an audience with a main character. The series of events the follow are mesmerizing. Every turn Jonnie takes, he meets a character who faces desperation much like his own. The film's plot progresses to a melting pot of desperate, psychopath and devastating characters. This film is a masterpiece. It features one of the most heartbreaking performances of all time by the brilliant actor: David Thewlis. Another performance I won't ever forget was from Katrin Cartilidge playing the character of Sophie. Her existence on screen is so weak yet so strong, her fragility is fascinating. Mike Leigh creates a world so bitter and sad in order to create cinematic poetry. This film's philosophic takes on life and humanity are so bleak, bold and honest. Hearing these takes is like getting punched in the stomach. This film had such a deep effect on me. I had trouble completing my day. It is nightmarish, bold, dark, devastating and ultimately, masterful.

    While this film featured a cast of characters played excellently by the actors, it's plot was much too flat for me to fully enjoy. I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.

    Really, one of my most appreciated and thought-provoking MOVIE picture of the last 20 years ... !? The screenplay &/or textual rendition/wording is just 'beyond' appreciation ... nor superficial understating ...; The whole 'spirit' of the STORY is in the characters' loss of appreciation for their being/presence , at this time of history, ... in this factual societal awareness ... ; they are just at a loss for justifying their consciousness of, their very-short lived, presence into this TIME lapsed (sic) awareness odd presence ... !? Bluntly, or straight-forwardly put, these dialogues are some of the most challenging I have encountered since some/most of the last 20 years ... ! Should you be looking for a thought-provoking, and challenging OPUS , to your better appreciated MOVIE experience, this NAKED item should do, wholesomely, totally, the works' ... ; So much fine-tuned, realistic, true-sounding, factual, ... trustful !?!

    i loved it! a great film with lots of sad music,dark satirical humour and typical of the works of Haneke there were lots of animals. i also loved the work of mike Leigh were there were lots of sad songs and piano fights. best film of 2008 by far, and definitely reflective of contemporary British culture. I must recommend! Finally, typical of the work of Leigh there were lots of beautiful camera angles and piano fights. I also loved how Leigh used elegant camera angles which ironically juxtaposed the dark reflection of inner city Britain to the peacefully put together long shots. Best of all the film acts as a great reminder of the tremendous works of Leigh. My only concern is that the use of animals may have been overdone in particular backgrounds of scenes. Criticisms? well my one criticism is that the work of Haneke is not THAT great of an influence. Overall, a great watch!

    The movie starts of promising. Ooh, dude rapes a girl, drama and anger is about to ensue. Oh wait no, it never f***ing happens. The movie is about nothing. Some homeless dude dicking around in London. The rest is people getting violently f***ed in the ass. That was seriously uncomfortable to watch. Stuff like this doesn't really ever bother me, but the way this was done made it goddamn weird. Some homeless guy goes to awoman's flat who he was spying on earlier, she cries cause she's old enough to be his nan and then he pulls her hair, chokes and motorboats her. Or that posh guy, Jeremy G Smart. What the f*** is he about? Who is he? He just casually waltzes in and f***s everyone. I gotta say... I kinda liked him... He's got that s***-eating grin the whole time. The reason why the movie doesn't score any lower is because: It has Ewen Bremner and David Thewlis in it. I like their faces. And because of the conversation he had with the security guard, that was kinda cool. Overall, the movie was so goddamn eh that it took me 3 days to watch it. It's just 2 hours of bulls***. The movie tries to be so deep but it isn't really. It's just random boring bulls***. F*** it I'm just going to hop away into the sunrise.

    An aimless, pointless, waste of time. Painfully overacted, especially by the nurse, but in general the endless speeches of David Thewlis reveal themselves to not be driving at anything in particular. The movie seems a self conscious attempt to show how much angst they can pack into a painfully slow two hours. If you can keep up with how fast Thewlis is talking you will realize that everything he says is only pseudo-intellectual trite word play. The fascination with rape and the scrawny posh psychopath are never shown to have any meaning, and there is hardly any plot to speak of. All of the female characters are an insult to women everywhere, as they fawn obsessively over a grimy tramp, and go on the occasional emotional tirade. The same melodramatic song is looped constantly. And if they were trying to send a nihilist message the millennial 'end is neigh' delusions only serve to remind us that Johnny is simply a nutter.

I absorbed both Nietzsche's theory of eternal recurrence through as explored by the film's character, Johny, as well as themes and motifs explored by the modernist writer, Samuel Beckett. Eerily enough, throughout watching this 1993 British film, I constantly had the feeling that I had already viewed this film. To end, Samuel Beckett's quote: 'I can't go on, I must go on' - while being a quote that may very well be overused by my subconscious - came to mind throughout viewing this film.
