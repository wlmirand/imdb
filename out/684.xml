 <sinopse>
  Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan couldn't save Kennedy, but he's determined not to let a clever assassin take out this president.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Frank Horrigan is a secret service agent who keeps thinking back to November 22, 1963, when, as a hand-picked agent by President Kennedy, he became one of the few agents to have lost a President to an assassin when Kennedy died. Now, former CIA assassin Mitch Leary is stalking the current President, who is running for re-election. Mitch has spent long hours studying Horrigan, and he taunts Horrigan, telling him of his plans to kill the President. Leary plans to kill the president because Leary feels betrayed by the government -- Leary was removed from the CIA, and the CIA is now trying to have him killed. After talking to Leary, Horrigan makes sure he is assigned to presidential protection duty, working with fellow secret service agent Lilly Raines. Horrigan has no intention of failing his President this time around, and he's more than willing to take a bullet. White House Chief of Staff Harry Sargent refuses to alter the President's itinerary, while Horrigan's boss, Secret Service ...

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

    "In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

    "In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

    "In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

    "In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

    "In the Line of Fire" is a very exciting film and works well because the film was well cast and very well written. Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him.

As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies.

Clint Eastwood plays an old Secret Service agent whose claim to fame was his being on the detail that protected President Kennedy in Dallas (oops). Not surprisingly, he blames himself for the assassination and although he seems like a great agent, he is imperfect and vulnerable. Out of the blue, a strange threat arises--a would-be assassin (John Malkovich) who announces himself to Eastwood's character! In other words, he tells the Service that he's going to kill the President and taunts them! And throughout the film, the psycho keeps contacting Eastwood--as if they are old friends! What's next? See it for yourself. While I am pretty sure a Secret Service agent would watch this film and spot a few flaws, for the average Joe, it seems pretty tight and well made. My only quibble was the notion in one scene where the agent (Eastwood) did NOT kill the killer when he had a chance because he knew he'd die in the process. My assumption is a real agent wouldn't even think about this. Perhaps I am wrong. But, it did make for good viewing--as did all the film. Plus, using an old guy like Eastwood worked because his age was figured into the plot--not some old guy pretending to be a lot younger than he really is. Well done. By the way, if you get a chance, watch "In the Line of Fire: The Ultimate Sacrifice"--a special feature on the DVD for the film. It talks about how the Secret Service worked with the crew to make sure the details in the film were correct. Fascinating.

    Here's another entertaining Clint Eastwood action-suspense film. Being a huge fan of him because he knows how to make entertaining movies and make his audience sit on the edge of their seats throughout the movie. Now there is an intense actor! In this story, Malkovich plays an assassin, and he is awesome to watch, thanks to his different disguises and the terrific dialogues he was given. Directed by Wolfgang Peterson (Director of Troy) it is one of those movies of 90s that would remind you of Eastwood's trademark role Dirty Harry Eastwood stars as a veteran Secret Service Agent who was on the job in Dallas as a young man when John F. Kennedy was assassinated. He's had his doubts ever since and been given to drink and his life at one time was a real shambles. He's gotten back on the White House detail now and when a potential assassin's landlady rats on her tenant to the Secret Service, it's Eastwood and partner Dylan McDermott who draw the case. But the assassin is no ordinary crank case. He's a professional at his job, trained by and used by the Central Intelligence Agency. John Malkovich earned a well deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actor but sadly he lost that year to Tommy Lee Jones for The Fugitive. Malkovich might have been better off, but he saw Eastwood as the agent in charge breaking into his apartment while on the job and he insisted on making the whole thing personal. He calls and taunts Eastwood throughout the film. And after a while what Malkovich says does causes Eastwood to get real personal. John Malkovich is also magnificent in perhaps his most famous and celebrated psycho role. Screen chemistry of these two incredible actors is enjoyable to watch- especially in the phone call scenes. "In the line of fire" has huge amount of splendid moments. Scene where Eastwood is hanging on the edge of the roof and points his gun at Malkovich's mouth who's only trying to help him is a classic and so is the elevator scene in the end of the film. If you ask me personally the best part was the climax involving Malkovich and Eastwood My Rating - 8/10

    ****SPOILERS*** Having the unenviable distinction to be the only Secret Service Agent to lose a president to an assassin's bullet Frank Horrigan's, Clint Eastwood, life has been a living hell since that faithful November day in Dallas Texas. That's when President John F. Kennedy was gunned down with him not being able to take the bullet that was meant for the president. In the 30 years since that tragic event in American history Horrigan had lost his wife who left him with the couples daughter and hit the bottle hard becoming an out and out drunk and given undercover field duty in him being unable to do his high profile job in protecting the resident of the United State. Unknow to Horrigan he'll soon be given another chance to redeem himself in the most unexpected way. And with that be able put his shattered life back together again if he's willing to accept the consequences. It's former CIA assassin and now deranged and loose cannon psycho Mitch Leary,John Mankovich,who gives Harrigan the chance he's been looking for all these years. In Leary planning to assassinate the now,in 1992, president of the United States Harry code-name Travler, Jim Curley, and give him a chance to prevent that from happening by taking the bullet meant for him; like the one he didn't takes when President Kennedy was gunned down in Dallas some 30 years ago! With Leary who calls himself Booth, After Abraham Lincoln assassin John Wilks Booth, food spooning Agent Horrigan all the clues in his attempted assassination of the president he's soon put back on his old job in protecting the president who's to be assassinated ,according to Leary,during an election campaign stop in L.A. at the Bonaventure Hotel. And it's at the Bonaventure Hotel that agent Horrigan will have to prove that he's got what it takes to protect the president by taking it on the chin or in the gut from Leary's concealed, under his tuxedo, handgun. The film "In the Line of Fire" preceded by some ten years a very similar Clint Eastwood movie "Blood Work" with Eastwood playing a retired cop, who's undergone open heart surgery, who attracted the attention on the man who caused him to go under the knife by having a heart attack in chasing him. And it's that person who later became Clint's biggest admirer in keeping him alive by having him obtain baldy need blood transfusions from people that he murdered with Clint's very rare blood type! In this movie Leary in fact helps Clint,or Agent Horrigan, redeem himself in saving the president's life and earlier in the film even ends up saving Clint's! ***SPOILERS***Leary as crazy as he is does Agent Horrigan a big favor in that he really doesn't expect to survive in all this but does expect Clint to redeem himself. As Leary later points out in a phone recorded message that he left, like a last will and testament, in his shabby hotel room for Horrigan and his pretty secret agent woman partner Lilly Raines,Rene Russo, to find. Despite being in his 60's at the time the film was made Clint Eastwood is in as good as shape as he was in any of his "Dirty Harry" movies. Hard and trim and looking at least 10 to 15 years younger it was hard to believe that he was within a few years of collecting his senior citizen or Social Security check.

    In the Line of Fire is directed by Wolfgang Petersen and written by Jeff Maguire. It stars Clint Eastwood, John Malkovich, Rene Russo and Dylan McDermott. Music is scored by Ennio Morricone and cinematography by John Bailey. Veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan (Eastwood) is pulled back into President protection duty when a deadly assassin, Mitch Leary (Malkovich), surfaces and announces his intention to kill the current incumbent of the Whitehouse. But Frank is feeling his age and he is haunted by his failure to stop the assassination of John F. Kennedy; and Leary knows this and uses it to toy with Horrigan's mindset. Good old fashioned thriller that we could do with more of these days, In the Line of Fire is a classic cat-and-mouse plot elevated to greater heights by Eastwood and Malkovich. Horrigan, a bastion of good with a determination to succeed and once again prove his worth, Leary, troubled but cunning and clever, it's a mental face off and the prize is not just the Presidents life, but also redemption. The script is sharp and the film hits its straps when Horrigan and Malkovich are in conversation, they have a definite link to each other, a common ground, even if Horrigan refuses to accept it. The writing shows intelligence and worth, with a Leary back story making him a scary uber villain. Russo always engages as fellow Secret Service Agent, Lilly Raines, her tender scenes with Eastwood well acted, while McDermott scores well but his character is one that features all too many times in cop/agent thrillers. Eastwood enjoys himself because he is asked to play himself, and the film is better for it, Malkovich, once again, proves he has few peers when it comes to playing off the chain baddies. 8/10

    "In the Line of Fire" is a fairly enjoyable, if obvious, tale of a guilt- ridden secret service agent being tortured by a terrorist. Eastwood gives a terrific performance who just wants to be left alone, but on the other hand, wants a second chance to redeem himself during a time of crisis. For a while, Malkovich's performance isn't especially interesting. Eventually, the character has some momentum. For those who lived through the JFK assassination, this movie will be especially meaningful, even though it's not technically about the JFK assassination. It may not be anything fresh, but it's very effective and entertaining. *** out of ****

    Before he became a super-hack, Wolfgang Petersen, who showed much promise with "Das Boot", directed "In the Line of Fire", perhaps his last decent film to date. The film stars the perpetually cool Clint Eastwood as a seething cauldron of masculinity, an ageing Secret Service agent who chases bad guys, beds youthful women and tells high ranking officials to kiss his taunt, well honed, bony ass. The film belong's to the "cat and mouse", "bodyguard" or "serial killer" genre, Eastwood essentially a slightly more civilised Dirty Harry, who follows clues, tracks leads and attempts to apprehend a maniac out to kill the President of the United States. For all his supposed non-conformity, Eastwood is still just another guy willing to throw body before bullet to protect his boss. The film was released in the wake of "The Bodyguard" and "Silence of Lambs" (both of which were part of a string of late 1980s, early 1990s serial killer and bodyguard movies), and works largely because of Eastwood, who chews scenery like a fleet of combine harvesters. He's like the modern Bogart, perpetually ticked off and oozing a laid back cool. John Malkovich plays the film's villain. He's another in a long line of balding and bespectacled serial killers, paedophiles or deviants. These characters are typically sexually neutral and/or androgynous, their hair loss signifying some sinister loss of masculinity, some kind of sexual aberration. Malkovich is suitably memorable in his role, but it's a thin, bogeyman role (much like Hopkins in "Silence of the Lambs"), in which the villain is imbued with a near supernatural intellect. Most of the film's "action" consists of verbal sparring, verbal games of one-oneupmanship, and brain battles, so "In The Line of Fire's" aged fairly well. The film is formulaic, literal cliffhanger ending and all, but Hollywood did such thrillers in the 1990s better than they do today. 8/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Quite simply a well-made, well-written and wonderfully acted movie. Eastwood is classic as grizzled Secret Service Agent Frank Horrigan and Rene Russo holds her own as partner (and love interest) Lilly Raines. But the movie's greatness rests on the shoulders of John Malkovich as "Booth". He captures this character's rage and hatred, as well as his humanity oddly enough. Personally I think this was his best performance and should have received an Oscar for it (But I loved Tommy Lee Jones in The Fugitive as well that year). Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!

    If you can stand the Hollywood Conceit of Romance with Sloppy kissing and groping between a Geezer and a Thirty-Something Hottie you might give this one a Pass because it is an Above Average Thriller with a Venomous Villain. If you can believe Clint Eastwood as a Jazz Pianist you might give this a Pass because it has much more going for it. There are a number of Suspenseful Set-Pieces and John Malkovich without doubt steals the Film from the One-Note Eastwood who really struggles delivering Lines at times and is unwatchable as He exchanges Loving Stares with Rene Russo. Overall, this is kept from sinking to Cringe inducing Territory by a Multi-Faced Malkovich that is as Creepy as they come. It moves along at a brisk pace and it needs too as it moves quickly from badly Written exchanges and exposition Scenes among Good Ol Boy Ballbusting and a predictable Sub-Plot with a Partner that is never fleshed out and comes across as totally Contrived. A Watchable Film that tries just a little too hard to be Heady, and the best of it outweighs those excruciating Filler bits and delivers an Entertaining, but Puffed-Up Piece of Product.

    Secret agent Frank Horrigan is a man of his past; his past being the assassination of John F Kennedy, of whose protection he was in-charge of. After his failure to prevent the assassination, he is only a former shell of himself. He does odd jobs, regarded by his colleagues with scorn and has nothing to look forward to in his life, until an assassin called Mitch Leary threatens to kill the President. Now Frank finds himself reliving the past with the heavy burden of his failure, the mistrust of his fellow agents, his guilt and the inevitable doomsday in which he must outsmart the energetic and cunning assassin. If so much of what you've read so far seems oh-so-familiar and predictable, it's because it is familiar and done to death. As is to be expected of such suspense thriller films, the plot involves the aging, disgruntled, insecure hero; the alluring fellow agent heroine; the cunning assassin who comes so close to killing the president but is stopped at the nick of time; the hero's partner who's aspiring to retire but is killed eventually.... so on and hence with. Clint Eastwood plays the insecure hero and that demands that he play it without his usual charm, style or sarcasm which is a drag because that is what makes his acting memorable. John Malkovich plays the cunning assassin but unfortunately, he does not have much to do rather than to taunt the hero in all the usual tried and tested methods. Rene Russo plays the alluring fellow agent heroine whose role involves mischievous temptation and then unwavering support. Without this star crew, one can imagine what sort of a reception this movie might have made and it is only because of these actors that one can sit through the painfully familiar and predictable story. The entire story hangs on the shoulder of Clint Eastwood, but what can he do with a role which demands that he can never do anything he is famous for. He can not have any sarcastic one liners or be a badass or even sport his usual sardonic look. The director of the movie is Wolfgang Petersen who directed such nerve wrecking thrillers like Air force one, The Perfect storm and Poseidon. A good director who palled after his best works Das Boot and Never ending story. In the line of fire is a movie that you can see if you are bored and not in the mood for anything serious at all but is best left untouched otherwise.

    I thought that this was a very good movie,, being a Clint Eastwood fan tho you hate to see him getting up there in age , and not being able to run as fast jump as high, or keep up with the bad guys,, but that's just me.. John Malcovich plays a great bad guy trying to kill the president of the u.s.a. . Clint plays Frank Horrigan, a secret service agent,, who failed to prevent the Kennedy Assassination,, and John Malcovich,, Mitch Leary knows this,, and he haunts Frank and tortures him throughout the whole movie,, saying why didn't you do more to protect the president you were the only one who didn't react to the first shot. so this time Mitch pretty much leaves a trail of bread crumbs for Frank to find so he can make this game of cat and mouse with our agent easier,, in the end you will just have to watch and see who wins.

Overall a great movie to see you want to peek into an assassin's mind and be on the edge of your seat the whole way through. Enjoy!!
