 <sinopse>
  A biographical story of former U.S. president Richard Milhous Nixon, from his days as a young boy to his eventual presidency which ended in shame.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Director Oliver Stone's exploration of former president Richard Nixon's strict Quaker upbringing, his nascent political strivings in law school, and his strangely self-effacing courtship of his wife, Pat. The contradictions in his character are revealed early, in the vicious campaign against Helen Gahagan Douglas and the oddly masochistic Checkers speech. His defeat at the hands of the hated and envied John F. Kennedy in the 1960 presidential election, followed by the loss of the 1962 California gubernatorial race, seem to signal the end of his career. Yet, although wholly lacking in charisma, Nixon remains a brilliant political operator, seizing the opportunity provided by the backlash against the antiwar movement to take the presidency in 1968. It is only when safely in office, running far ahead in the polls for the 1972 presidential election, that his growing paranoia comes to full flower, triggering the Watergate scandal.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.

    Like other reviews, I have never been fond of Oliver Stone movies, but this is an exception. Anthony Hopkins is nothing short of amazing in the film. Hopkins plays the role of the late Richard Nixon. The film has a great perspective of the psychological issues Nixon went through from his days as a boy to his resignation as president. The movie shows many of these issues and how they manifested themselves to Nixon's fall from grace. First, we see the threatening nature of his father combined with the "saint"-like qualities of his mother and how they affected him. We see Nixon later feel haunted by the Kennedy family and the success John and Bobby had rising up the political ranks until their lives were tragically ended. We see Nixon's overwhelming desire for the presidency tests his marriage to Pat, brilliantly played by Joan Allen. In addition, we see a man who feels he is above the law during the late part of his first term. In summary, all of his demons haunt him and this is brilliantly displayed in the film. I also liked to see the drama inside the White House. The statesman Henry Kissinger, played by Paul Sorvino, was great and his accent was very similar to the real Kissinger. We see Bob Haldeman (James Woods) portrayed as anti-Semitic with his cruel comments about Kissinger's background. David Hype Pierce of Frasier fame plays John Dean, a man who vowed to not take the fall for the Watergate scandal. As the movie develops, we are intrigued with the drama and how the administration fell apart. Hopkins' outrage in the Oval Office after a conference telling of the withdrawal from Vietnam is great acting. We see Nixon feel appreciated by the people. He then blames Ted Kennedy for the press' questions about Watergate. Joan Allen's role has been criticized by some others but I thought it was top-notch. She plays Nixon's wife who stands up to her husband upon losing in the California governor race in 1962. She threatens him with divorce and he says to the press core "you won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." After LBJ decides to not run, he changes his mind and runs in 1968. Pat at first is upset but then allows him to run. However, during his presidency, Pat calls out her husband as they don't vacation together and he changes as the quest for power and control seriously damages the marriage. She plays the loyal wife but does get her two cents in. The rest of the cast is top-notch to say the least. Bob Hoskins plays the manipulative J. Edgar Hoover who has a major grudge against the Kennedys. Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig, the man who finally convinces Nixon that he is in severe trouble and peril with impeachment looming. E.G. Marshall plays the bitter John Mitchell. Mary Steenburgen plays Nixon's mother whose life and influence overshadow her son's life in several occasions through the film. Larry Hagman plays Jack Jones, a Texas man (reminds me of his role on Dallas) who once was an ally to Nixon but their alliance falls apart later in the film. A great line from Hagman "Mr. President, do you forget who got you where you are?" Nixon: "The American people did." Hagman:"Oh really? That can be changed." I have seen the movie three times and intrigued by it every time. I wished I had seen when it first came out. If you love history or intrigued by the crucial period of the late 60's and early 70's, you will love this movie! Highly rated!

    (Note: This review is based on the 2008 Election Year Edition DVD) Oliver Stone's 1995 film Nixon is something of an oddity. Released on the back of Stone's success with JFK and Natural Born Killers, it was largely praised by critics yet was all but ignored by audiences. Nearly twenty years later, the film stands up though as one of Stone's best films and presents an intriguing portrait of one of the most controversial men to occupy the Oval Office: Richard Milhous Nixon. Anthony Hopkins performance as Nixon is the heart and soul of the film. While Hopkins may not have done Nixon's voice or bare the greatest resemblance to him, he is nevertheless compelling in the role. Hopkins does that by capturing the many varying and often contradictory qualities of Nixon as the film moves back and forth through time from 1960 to 1974 and the year's in-between. There are moments of introspection, moments where's purely unlikeable (such as the dinner scene between Nixon and Pat late in the film) and yet moments where he is all too human. What Hopkins and the film succeed in doing is making Nixon not a caricature, but a human being and the film ultimately works as a result. The rest of the cast is strong as well. Paul Sorvino makes for an excellent and utterly convincing Henry Kissinger and, like Hopkins, rises up the caricatures to create a full-fledged character. Joan Allen's performance from Pat Nixon is interesting to watch as the relationship between her and Nixon develops and leads to some of the film's best scenes (such as the aforementioned dinner scene). There are also strong performances from James Woods, J. T. Walsh, David Hyde Pierce, Powers Boothe, Bob Hoskins, Sam Waterston (who only appears in the director's cut and steals the show for the space of his lengthy scene as CIA director Richard Helms) and Mary Steenburgen amongst others in the large cast. Like Stone's JFK, the film works in large part due to the strength of its cast. The film's production values are strong well. The film's recreations of the Nixon White House are stunning both to look at it and in their historical accuracy. The production design also does fine work creating the various settings of the film ranging from where Nixon grew up to a TV studio where one of the 1960 television debates took place to Air Force One and the presidential yacht. There's also a sparse but well done score from John Williams which also incorporates some good source music, including quoting Williams' own score for JFK at one point. What doesn't work as well is a newsreel sequence set after Nixon's 1962 defeat when he ran for governor of California due to some crude and even laughable pasting of Hopkins face into archival images and footage but that it is just about forgivable in light of the rest of the film. Looking at the film itself, it's easy to see why it failed to find a larger audience. Nixon takes the leaps in time seen in JFK (which itself was arguably a murder mystery on a fundamental level) to new levels as the film begins on the brink of the infamous 1972 Watergate break in, jumps forward to November 1973 and then proceeds to engage in a series of flashbacks (often within another flashback) as well as leaping forwards in time as it heads to the Presidential resignation in August 1974. The film also takes on a surreal and, at times, hallucinatory air such as bomb's exploding behind Nixon during a visit to the Lincoln Memorial, an odd tunnel effect used during his pneumonia episode or his mother's ghost appearing during one scene. The results can be hard to follow at times but the result is a rewarding one if the viewer sticks with it. The reason is that the film, largely through its script and Hopkins' Nixon, presents a fascinating portrait of a man and his times. The film shows a man who was in many ways admirable yet could be distant, cocky, ruthless, self-pitying, and paranoid who seemed to always be unsure of himself. Ultimately, Nixon as a film is a tragedy, the story of a man who causes his own downfall as a result of letting his personal demons overrule his better nature. While the film has been criticized for its historical accuracy (though the extensive footnotes in the published screenplay goes a long way to refute that), it nevertheless presents a fascinating was and perhaps even truthful image of a man who rarely if ever showed his true face. Nixon then is an intriguing film filled with strong performances, strong production values and a script that paints a fascinating image of a controversial figure. Yet in the way it's told, it is a film that can be long winded, leaps around decades of history and can be oddly surreal at times. As a result, Oliver Stone has created a film that is every bit as complex as its subject matter and, quite possibly, made all the better for it.

    The most alienating of Presidents Nixon did very little to be the Leader of America. He steadfastly and without hesitation, apology, or even a slight understanding of what was dividing the Country, was a classic egocentric. His way was the only way and the only way you were going to be a bona-fide Citizen of "His" Nation was to follow him or get out ("love it or leave it"...remember that?). That may be a tough and simplistic analysis of a complex Political Figure but it is in the opinion of many, True. The Film displays this as Fact and it is probably not too far off. Here we see a consistently troubled (even in pre-Watergate times and Childhood) Personality that was most likely doomed the minute he became dependent on the Public for success. This is a mesmerizing and dazzling Picture with all the Oliver Stone touches. The familiar Stylist flourishes with abandon and Pride as he presents a "Biography" ultra-dramatized for effect and intent. It sweeps like a vacuum and not a broom as it powerfully draws in and upon a large amount of unsettling History and Psychological diagnosis. Overall, it is compelling and interesting, riveting and revolting, as we watch a National Figure lose his soul, as quoted at the beginning of the Movie, and it is not a fun thing to observe. This is a forever dark and brooding affair much like the title "Character". For it seems, for the most part, Richard Nixon was more like a Characterization of a Person than a Person, both here on screen and in Real Life. The Human Nixon always seemed to be in noncompliance with the "Third-Person Nixon" that he liked to refer to. (the President states..."I would like to apologize for the murdered students at Kent State...but Nixon can't")

    I still am perplexed by this roller-coaster of a movie - three hours of very weird montage, sudden jumps, crazy color schemes, abrupt flashbacks and very heavy moments made me quite amazed. I am not an Olver Stone fan and I am more on Steven Spielberg's side, but then, I really wanted to see a Nixon movie. Richard M. Nixon was and still sadly is a traduced, maligned and ill-depicted man but he was a real man, driven and deep, full of demons (who isn't?) and really decent in many (but not all) ways. Anthony Hopkins did a great job here, maybe, too far sometimes. I saw many footages with real Nixon and he was not that caricature as Hopkins depicted him. And come on, was he really that much into drinking? The sources are highly controversial in there. Anyway, that was very compelling and mind-provoking to see that monster of a film and realize how multi-faceted and difficult Nixon was, and all who were near him. The brilliant cast of drama heavies (Woods, Sorvino, Allen, Hoskins, Harris) did a decent job, true. But one serious claim remains - the life of this great man was so large and busy that even 3 hours were not enough. Must have been a serial or several films. There are some more complaints about the movie - no Chuck Colson, no deeper plot with Ed Harris, not enough on McCarthy - but still, the film is not bad. Albeit, too harsh on a real great man

    or only map of an existence. memorable performance of Hopkins. and a character who can be, in same time, Faus and Mephistofel. because the film is, in Stone manner, a trip in heart of evil. not the evil with E but the common evil, the basic basket with sins, the fight and fall against/ in the hole of fear and cruelty, cowardice, lies and law as minor line. it is more than a movie. it remains a mirror. because it is not only the story/a story about Nixon and his Gollum silhouette or an extraordinary show with impressive cast. it is a kind of documentary about a world, a way, a form of desire and hypocrisy without limits. in final, film about a poor man and his demons. and an experience. not easy. but precise as cold lesson.

    Maybe overall the film wasn't that bad but many times the 'plot' descended into the pits/depths of poor cinema. Oliver Stone, if his intent was to portray former President Nixon in a sensitive even sympathetic light, the final cut didn't attest to that fine sentiment. Yeah, there were some poignant scenes that sort of cast the brooding politician often photographed with a permanent five-o'clock shadow in a cleaner, shinier light. For example... President Nixon's encounter with some student protesters at the Linclon Memorial comes to mind: especially the exchange with the 19 year old female. Her assertion pierced Nixon deep. I paraphrase: "So, you're powerless." Nixon's response though was mere fodder for the next volley. "No... Change takes time. I am able to control the 'system' some of the time." The girl pounced on that one. "Sounds like a wild animal." Really, that's about the only scene where Stone cut President Nixon some 'slack. Then there's the drinking bouts. In this film, everyone drank and drank like there was no tomorrow, no presidency. Only occasionally and for mere seconds did any of the cast stop to eat/breathe/despair. By my count, Mr. President had 60 double whiskeys in a little over two hours. Now if you mix in the champagne cocktails and Texas chili dogs, Dick, was well over the legal limit for breathalizing with civility. The good... Anthony Hopkins, in his portrayal of 'Treeky Dick' gave a good account of himself but maybe not that of the real man. The supporting cast were just that. No one member stood out or forward as outstanding. And there were plenty of moments where some subordinate should have grabbed the baton and done something, anything useful. For sure, Stone didn't coach them in any strong direction. Too much ad-liberalism... The bad... Why mention Howard Hunt and then not follow up on the foreshadowing? Better yet, why cast Ed Harris as the mystery man if in the film he was relegated to holding the bag-man? Makes no sense but helps the plot meander... The ugly... If you're going to be kind, Oliver, please cut the cursing. Even Bob, scuza me, J. Edgar Hoover said as much. Yes, presidents who occasionally curse are no less presidential. Seems to me though that Stone wanted to cast a crooked, accusatory finger at Nixon even while the latter gazed affectionately at the larger than life portrait of the famous and much beloved Civil War president, Lincoln. That's a bit unkind. OK, Nixon paid his vows (when the camera was on him) to IKe's portrait as well but no homage what-so-ever to John's. And whenever the besieged President Nixon encountered the real white house ghost, Dick followed the script but not before he poured a drink. Then he punted. Summation... Oliver's film shed little if any new light on who Mr. Richard Milhouse Nixon really was. To wit, Stone's rendition is a mere whitewash of what he could/should have done for the disgraced former President: tell the truth. In that regard, this film didn't even probe the surfaces. I'm more befuddled than ever. My guess: so is the surviving Nixon family. They and Richard Nixon deserved better. Hope history is as kind to the man as Henry Kissinger portended.

    Honestly folks, I really went into this movie with a lot of hope. My friend and I watched JFK when we were 16 and were blown away. We became conspiracy geeks for a couple of years after seeing it. But by the time this movie came out we had already done a lot of homework on the JFK conspiracy and found out that Oliver Stones JFK was filled with a lot of speculation made to look like facts. We were a little more skeptical of this Oliver Stone movie knowing we were somewhat duped by his last picture. We had done a lot of studying on Nixon and Watergate and knew quite a bit about what had happened. Truthfully, Stone went even further this time in assassinating Nixons character and the truth in general. I look back on movies like JFK and Nixon and it pisses me off like nothing else that someone can manipulate the facts like this man has! He has misinformed sooo many people who don't do their homework and take what this movie presents as the absolute truth. What really bothers me is that Hollywood thought this boring, pathetic movie that tries to manipulate its audience into believing "facts" about Nixon and Watergate is simply political hogwash! Why else would a movie that was very boring and hard to follow given so much attention? Honestly people, aside from Michael Moore and his "ficticious documentaries" (if there can be such a genre), Stone is a lot like the snake in the garden = Present you with something that looks good, but is all lies and manipulation in the end. Even if your a liberal, don't bother with this politically bias crap. Using this movie to bolster your argument will only make you ignorant in the end.

    Who could have possibly thought that Oliver Stone would surpass the level reached by "JFK", one of the greatest political thrillers ever made? Yet his "Nixon" is not only the harrowing political biography of the most controversial and unpopular President of the United States, but also the gripping psychological study of a tormented man who got too much to prove. It's also a terrific movie served by an impressive casting: Anthony Hopkins, Joan Allen, James Woods, Bob Hoskins, Ed Harris, E.G. Marshall, Madeline Kahn and an unrecognizable Paul Sorvino as Henry Kissinger. And it's definitely one of the best movies of 1995, which is saying a lot. "Nixon" borrows a lot of elements from "JFK" on the editing department, swinging back and forth from childhood memories to the present, from the Watergate scandal to its dark premises. The film is complex, almost confusing but never gratuitously because Nixon himself happens to be an enigmatic and larger-than-life character. Roger Ebert even compared the film to "Citizen Kane", establishing an interesting parallel between Richard Nixon and Charles Foster Kane. Nixon does remind of Kane in his excesses, his capability to be disdained by the establishment yet respected within his inner circle, and his heart consumed by an unconscious desire to be loved while trying to hide a torment deeply rooted in his childhood. The comparison is even truer because like Kane, Nixon hides a terrible secret, although the missing eighteen minutes from the White House recordings would unveil something more unpleasant than the mysterious 'Rosebud'. Behind every great man, there's a secret, but in Nixon's case, there's also a woman. And as Pat Nixon, Joan Allen delivers a subtle but pivotal performance as the woman who evolves in her husband's shadow but in her own supportive way, acts as the only guardian angel of a man who sold his soul to a certain Machiavellian view of power. She believes in his talent to win the election, but not the hearts, people would never love him because she knows how uneasy it was for her to love him. The chronicles of a man who could never be loved, that could be indeed the subtitle of Nixon's journey in the White House, in his whole political career actually. Indeed, Nixon won two elections, opened China, signed a nuclear treaty with Russia, ended the longest war America ever knew, but as great achievements as they were, Nixon's dark side eclipsed them: Vietnam, Cambodia, Allende, the Watergate. In his most lucid moments, Nixon even recognizes that his road to success was paved by dead bodies, he could go to college because his older brother died of tuberculosis, Jack Kennedy was assassinated, then Bobby, his luck carried the seeds of his doom. This is when the comparison with "JFK" stops, it's not an investigation but a character study. And as Dick Nixon, Anthony Hopkins never tries to make an impersonation but rather creates his own personification of an eternal outcast, haunted by the ghosts from the past, a man who always had to forge his carapace, by building his own legend through his modest Quaker background "in the poorest farm of California", always using it as an alibi to justify that he's one of the 'little people'. And when an outcast experiments the power, and tastes its irreplaceable savor after the post-War republican wave, he can't renounce it. Nixon knew he was born to rule the most powerful country of the world, like a personal revenge: "Only if you have been in the deepest valley, can you ever know how magnificent it is to be on the highest mountain." This taste for revenge is his inner demon. I'm not comparing two characters, but "Nixon" kind of reminded me of "Downfall" in the way the White House is showed, as a sort of bunker where the state's ugliest secrets are covered, a shadowy and gloomy place waiting for the enemy (here the media) to come to the leader. And one by one, like a sinking ship, every faithful soldier is drown in the scandal, and Nixon, as the Captain, is the last to leave. Ebert wrote about Bruno Ganz' performance as Hitler: "Admiration I did not feel. Sympathy I felt in the sense that I would feel it for a rabid dog, while accepting that it must be destroyed." In a lesser measure of course, I think this could work as the right answer to those who believed that Stone, a notorious left wing, created empathy toward Nixon. Stone never used his patriotism at the expenses of intelligence. Nixon is responsible of his downfall but a whole system is to blame, Nixon was flawed but his enemies weren't nobler. And that's what Stone brilliantly denounces. In many scenes, Nixon reminds the Press of its lack of objectivity, its obsession and outspoken hatred. These words are still relevant today; Nixon is the quintessential incarnation of the 'person we love to hate'. Indeed, with his victory sign trademark, his sweating and angry look contrasting with Kennedy's shining smile, from his "I'm not a crook" to his dog Checkers, from his resignation to "The Simpsons" (he even inspired through his middle-name the name of Milhouse) to hold-up masks, he's in his way, an icon of popular culture, or unpopular if you prefer. Nixon appears as an individual whose republican obedience veiled his true idealism, his fascination for Lincoln, the President who ended the Civil War, or Kennedy as a beloved figure. People look at Kennedy and want to be him, but when they look at them, they find Nixon, less than a low self-esteem; it's a sentiment of total waste that invades his heart when he look at Kennedy's picture during his last night in the White House. Nixon's tragedy is America's, and maybe that's why he was loathed, because people don't want to look at themselves.

    Oliver Stone, the most outspokenly political American filmmaker of the 1980's and 1990's, directs this epic-length biography of Richard Nixon, the 37th President of the U.S., who was re-elected by a landslide in 1972, only to resign in disgrace two years later in the movie entitled,Nixon.It stars Anthony Hopkins in a genuinely great performance as the scandal-plagued former president.The parade of stars playing figures in Nixon's orbit are: Joan Allen,who plays his long-suffering wife Pat; Mary Steenburgen,who portrays his mother Hannah; Bob Hoskins is cast as J. Edgar Hoover;Powers Boothe plays Alexander Haig; Paul Sorvino portrays Henry Kisinger;Ed Harris plays E. Howard Hunt; J.T. Walsh as John Ehrlichman; James Woods as Bob Haldeman; David Hyde Pierce as John Dean among many others. Taking a non-linear approach, the movie jumps back and forth between many different periods and events, from Nixon's strict upbringing at the hands of his Quaker mother, through the many peaks and valleys of his political career, to his downfall in the wake of the Watergate scandal. The facts of his life are blended with supposition and speculation to create a portrait that is often critical of the man's policies but displays an unexpected compassion toward his failings as a human being. The film is obviously thoughtful, well-researched and carefully modulated when presenting the late President,Richard Nixon as tries to paint him as a human being with flaws and the viewer gets a glimpse of both his persona and psyche.When viewing this film,thoughts of Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear come to mind as the viewer witness a ruler destroyed by his fatal flaws and weaknesses. Also,credit the great performances of the cast particularly Anthony Hopkins and Joan Allen as they elevate the film to a level of greatness not achieved by other films.And most of all,Nixon is the epic motion picture that delves into the inner sanctum of a tragic world leader, uncovering his greatest moments and his shattering demise in Watergate.

    Without doubt Anthony Hopkins performance as Richard Nixon cements his position as one of the finest and most powerful actors of the last 20 years. Without bearing any great resemblance, he gets closer to inhabiting the almost impenetrable enigma that was Nixon than any other actor could do. Looking beyond his towering portrayal, the performances of the supporting cast are mostly exemplary. You just know that James Woods and JT Walsh were born to play Haldeman and Ehrlichman. Ed Harris is a chilling Howard Hunt, Mary Steenburgen a dedicated but controlled and ultimately unaffectionate mother, Powers Boothe a loyal but pragmatic Al Haig, Bob Hoskins a thoroughly devious J Edgar Hoover and Madeleine Kahn a delightfully outspoken Martha Mitchell. If I had to quibble I would say that Joan Allen makes Pat Nixon a far steelier character than she probably was and EG Marshall is too old to play John Mitchell. Oliver Stone does not play too fast and loose with the real story and endeavours to explore Nixon's childhood and other events in his life to try to explain what what made him what he became. Occasionally he is more sympathetic than one might have expected. The use of black and white is overdone, although real footage is skilfully interlaced with the acting. But the ultimate triumph is Hopkins' performance.
