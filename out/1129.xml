 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Wong Kar-Wai's movie about two love-struck cops is filmed in impressionistic splashes of motion and color. The first half deals with Cop 223, who has broken up with his girlfriend of five years. He purchases a tin of pineapples with an expiration date of May 1 each day for a month. By the end of that time, he feels that he will either be rejoined with his love or that it too will have expired forever. The second half shows Cop 663 dealing with his breakup with his flight attendant girlfriend. He talks to his apartment furnishings until he meets a new girl at a local lunch counter.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here.

    Randomly found this at a Barnes and Noble for only $30 with the online price going for close to $60 so I figured I should get it. I've always like Wong Kar Wai and his movies. Very indie, very 90's and very good. Chungking Express follows the lives of 2 police officers in Hong Kong and see their love lives. The first is love sick over an ex-girlfriend of his, and eats more diced pineapple than Rick Ross. He meets a blond headed woman at the bar he goes to and hits on her. She leads some kind of Indian drug ring. Midway through its switches viewpoint to another police officer who's in love with a waitress at a local food stand who listens to the song California Dreamin' constantly. This movie is well made and well structured. The acting is great and believable. The soundtrack doesn't distract from the movie. My problem with the movie is the lack of progress and the loose ends of the 1st story. Overall me memorable movie from Wong Kar Wai, and one of the best foreign movies of the last 20 years

    WARNING: SMALL SPOILERS MAY BE GIVEN BELOW Today being a lazy Sunday, I finally got around to watching Chungking Express. This film is something which has always been on my lengthy cinema bucket list.I am joyous that I took the the time viewing into this film as it was both uplifting and meditative amongst the chaos. The film's plot revolves around two separate narratives regarding two policemen working within Chungking,both of whom have gone through recent break ups. Their stories are told sequentially and are both running in chagrin until they encounter a new woman. For the first story, we become acquainted with He Qiwu, a man who pines over his most recent relationship with a girl called May. Whilst the May of which his relationship recently ended with has no screen time, there is plenty of monologue spoken from He Qiwu and interaction with other characters regarding her that as an audience we can feel his pain. (I mean, who hasn't been there before?) He Qiwu goes on the rebound and seeks out a girl after much self pity. It is at bar that he encounters a certain femme fatale. The femme fatale is not issued a name in this story segment however it just adds to the sense of mystery she aesthetically displays by the "costume" of which she wears: A Blonde Wig and Glasses. It becomes quickly evident within the first fifteen minutes of the film that she is a dangerous presence as we see her organizes an illegal drug smuggling operation. When He Qiwu and the woman with the blonde wig cross paths, it is not because he is after her. It is because he found himself out at a bar on the prowl and as we as viewers are sure of, the ineluctability of them meeting together is certain. They are not united together as lovers, however there is a slither of hope given to He Qiwu after their encounter and in his current position, a morale booster. In the second story, the unnamed Cop 663 is going through the motions post break up with an air stewardess. We see that the stewardess had decided to visit a snack counter which he frequents and gave a letter to the owner regarding her wishes to break up and keys to the apartment. This is all caught by the exuberant Faye, a worker at the counter. As Cop 663 does not wish to look at the envelope being fully aware of what the letter will detail, Faye falls him for and uses the keys to start rearranging the house while he is at his day-shift unaware. From there, the story builds around the meetings between of both Faye and Cop 663. Throughout both stories there are reoccurring motifs that we take in such as expiry dates, the name of May, a model airplane, California Dreamin' by The Mamas & Papas, a Garfield stuffed toy and more which have been omitted from this review. The symbolism behind these help build the strength of both stories and also slightly relate them. The setting of Chungking is a multicultural place and in being so it is interesting to hear dialog hear dialog in Mandarin, Cantonese, Japanese and Indian throughout the film. It is hard for the setting to not draw you in. However, despite the streets being as flooded with populace as they are, we are left with the contrast of the characters usually being in isolated locations. Taciturn and with a running self monologue. The soundtrack should be a key player in any film watched and in The Chungking Express it is not something which is not to be ignored. Most notably the soundtrack is dominated by California Dreamin' during the second half of the movie. The highlight song for me personally is a delightful Cantonese cover version of the song "Dreams" originally performed by the Cranberries sung by no other than Faye Wong, main actress of the second segment. In regards to the cinematography, it is hard to believe that shots being taken are not being done so under natural lighting. In a scene where the Indians are assembling clothes and toys, we get various cutaway shots and amazing editing. (In particular one shot of shoes filled with cocaine/heroin being put away is shot upside down which for unknown reasons I really love) The editing is quick and fast paced, rarely lingering. Through the use of shaky held hand camera during chase scenes and the busy streets we feel disorientated and just as lost as the characters on screen. I believe this film is an equally a comfort to those in love as to those who are out of love. Don't give up.

    Oddly enough it is not before 2013 that I got around to watching "Chungking Express", despite being a huge fan of Hong Kong cinema and having lived and worked in Hong Kong as well. The reason for this? Well, I just never got around to it, despite having heard all the good things about this movie. And now that I have seen it, I must say that this movie really wasn't one that stood out that much in my opinion. The movie just didn't leave that much of a lasting impression on me. Sure there were some really great scenes and some good ideas put to the screen, but overall the two stories told here were not just exceptional. The first story with the drug trafficking ring came off as too hastily put together, because there weren't any satisfactory ending to it, in my opinion. Whereas the second story with the police officer and the waitress turned out to be much more appealing for me, as it was funnier and had a more coherent red thread throughout its course. "Chungking Express" is not the type of Hong Kong movie that will appeal just to anyone, it certainly didn't sit all that well with me, and I must admit that I have seen many more movies from Hong Kong that far outshines this one. I am not saying that "Chungking Express" is a bad movie, far from it. It is just different - story-wise, that is. As for the cinematography, well then they really did a good job here. The camera-work and the angles of the shots were just superb, and there was a very dynamic feel to the scenes in both the stories. Which leaves me to comment on the acting. As a fan of Tony Leung, I must admit that the appeal to the second story had a big part of him being in it, as he always do great jobs with the movies he is in. But also noteworthy here was Faye Wong - also in the second story. Personally, I have never understood the hype about Brigette Lin, but hey, a matter a personal preference, I suppose. It was a bit strange to see Takeshi Kaneshiro in this movie, but he did a good job with his given character. To me, "Chungking Express" was a fairly mediocre movie, though it did impress on the visual side, but it doesn't really stand out for me in an otherwise overwhelming market of Hong Kong movies out there. Hence I am giving it a 5/10 rating only.

    One of the strangest love stories you'll ever see, Chungking Express is a two-part adventure where oddball protagonists look for love to fill a void outside their unsatisfying day jobs. The characters are so bizarre you'll keep watching just to figure out what drives them. The camera-work is memorizing with a nice blend of warm colors and skewed angles to capture the wandering streets of Hong Kong. The soundtrack really adds to the intoxicating love-struck style of the film too, where songs become stuck in your head (most likely an intentional result). Performances are excellent across the board as each actor gives their meandering search for love an original twist. This movie feels like a flash-bang of youth, although not in a typical rebel-against-society style, rather a deeper quest in order to fulfill what one wants truly for themselves to be happy. This is a romance unlike any other, and may be arguably Wong Kar-Wai's best feature to date. Keep an open mind and you'll no doubt be pleased. -9/10

    This movie will not appeal to everyone. This is two stories in one. I've heard a lot of people saying the second half was better, but I thought both parts were equally effective. "Chungking Express" was basically filmed while Wong Kar Wai was on hiatus from the "Ashes of Time" project. It's obvious this film provided the director with an escape, or a freedom of expression that the audience feels from the opening credits until the end of the film. While the story may feel disjointed - the style is extremely consistent and the pacing and music in the film really balance so nicely here. I had enjoyed the two films I had seen from this director,"happy together" and "Fallen Angels", but I absolutely loved this one. There is something very real about this dreamlike world that the director has created here. The acting and writing are sharp, but it is the overall mood/feel of this film that really makes it stand apart. Won Kar Wai throws in some parallel characters that resemble the leads, and he also jumps time within the main characters lives. Both of these aspects add a little more intrigue to the story. This is a film that definitely needs repeat viewings to capture all the little nuances. Proof that when a talented director just throws something together it can be more powerful than an epic that takes years to make. Could have used a little less of the Chinese version of the Cranberries tune. That's my only gripe. This film has a few scenes that rank right up there with some of the fondest film memories that I have. This is a GREAT movie. Very unique, stylish effort. 93/100

    Wong Kar-wai's romance-drama, Chungking Express (1994), is story told in in two parts, each consisting of two Hong Kong policemen who are heartbroken from their respective ex- girlfriends. The first story drew me in by the quirkiness of Teshi Kaneshiro's character, He Zhiwu, Cop 223. The seamless charm that he carries with him through all his encounters was particularly engaging and was performed well by Kaneshiro. There was a certain curiosity that left me yearning for more with the woman in the blonde wig, played by Brigitte Lin. Yet, the end of the segment was somewhat unfulfilling, lacking closure and a genuine resolution to the story. However, I still feel as though the first story was more engaging and interesting to watch narratively. Whilst there was far more screen time for the character development of our main protagonist in the second story, it still seemed like we knew Cop 223 from the first, more intimately. This is thanks to the script, containing wonderfully poetic descriptions of his experience with love and heartbreak. When he has eats a month's worth of canned-pineapple that expires on May 1, (in reference to his ex-girlfriend, May) the description that he will either reunite with his love or that it will have 'expired' forever is filled with rich imagery that captured the characters thoughts, flawlessly. The second story had weaker depth of characters due to the confusing plot line and generally less engaging characters. Faye (played by Faye Wong) added some quirkiness to the cast with her strange affection and obsession for Cop 663 (Tony Leung Chiu Wai). The greatest aspect of the second story was its impressive soundtrack. For the whole film, the inventive cinematography using limited funds and unique techniques on a hand-held camera were its greatest strengths and what the film is deservedly recognised for.

    Don't think that many people are aware of it but throughout the decades some pretty good movies have been released from Hong Kong. The movies are often more stylish and less restrained from lets say a Chinese or Japanese production. In a way they are more like Korean movies, which is good news to hear for those who love and are familiar with Asian cinema. And quite frankly, this movie is all about its style. Or at least it was for me. It's actually hard to believe this is a 1994 production, since the style and approach of it feels far more modern. This movie so easily could had been made and released this present day and probably would had been a bigger hit as well, seeing how popular Asian movies are now days. It's a very visual movie, with some amazing, innovative, camera-work. It truly makes the movie feel like a very lively and fast going one, even when there is not an awful lot happening with its story. The story is being more one of the subtle kind. It takes its time to set up things and all of its characters and doesn't ever force anything. It sort of lets the story work out as a realistic and sweet one. It's a love-story but truly far from a typical one. Watching "Chung Hing sam lam" is an unique experience, in more than one way. It might not be everybody's kind of thing but those who want to experience something different and more visual orientated shall have a great time watching this movie! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    One obvious sign of liking a movie is watching it again and again. Some thoughts after a tenth time with "Chungking Express": 1. The movie and my viewing of it make up a set of harmonious coincidences. First: According to what I have read, it was conceived and completed quickly when the director hit a two-month hiatus in the midst of another project. Second: The movie treats the way chance encounters sometimes turn into things of great consequence. Third: I saw the movie on a hot summer afternoon in 1996, also very much by chance when, while walking home from work, I suddenly wanted to spend a couple of hours in an air conditioned theater. "Chungking Express" just happened to be the first movie I found. I knew nothing about it before watching it. Fourth: And after seeing it and liking it very much, I pretty much forgot about it until seeing the Criterion DVD in 2011  fifteen (15) years later. This belated second viewing was the one that cast a spell. And it has become stronger with every repeat viewing. Maybe this ever growing affection for the movie parallels the developing relationship between the characters. 2. Another comment on repeat viewings: I had never heard of any of the cast or crew of this movie before I saw it. I think I experienced the first viewing without having to filter my impressions through the lens of the celebrity and stardom of the performers. Instead the people in the movie  at least the non-criminal ones  are people I have come to like very much, almost as friends. A strange effect, hard to describe. It may account for the many viewings, which are almost like visiting people I simply enjoy being with. I'd be interested to find out if I'm the only one who has had this reaction. 3. A date movie, yes, but a paradoxical one. Even though when I first saw this movie I was dating two women and recall taking one of them to another certifiable "date movie" during this period, I have never seen "Chungking Express" with anyone but myself. Maybe this is a good movie for people about to go on a date to see separately before going out, making this sort of a "pre-date" movie. The cross currents of rejection and breaking up, with a cast of endearing solipsists searching for companionship and falling in love, albeit one-sidedly and with aching tentativeness, make this the only "date movie" I know of that can work its magic (for me, anyway) when enjoyed alone. 4. Eighteen years after its initial release the movie does not look terribly dated. Although at the time of release the impending reversion of Hong Kong to mainland control was three years away, the characters do not explicitly mention the subject. The prospective change of government, something "there" obliquely for my first viewing in 1996, seems to have disappeared as a significant aspect of the movie. The only obvious set of time markers is the use of pay telephones, answering services, and pagers. This retro ingredient is more than balanced by a prophetic use of abrupt, swooping, convulsive camera movements and step printing: although rooted in the world of MTV, the look of the film anticipates cell phone and You Tube video. 5. The film offers a look at some of the things going on in the world of motion pictures in the early to mid-90's: international interest in Hong Kong cinema and Asian cinema generally; the influence of MTV-inspired film technique; a spike in the perennial popularity of romantic comedies; audience acceptance of combined stories with fragmented, braided narrative lines ("Chungking Express" was released at about the same time as "Pulp Fiction".) 6. In my nearly six decades of watching movies I can't remember any of them achieving in 90 minutes or more the truth and emotional power that "Chungking Express" manages to pack into its final 15 seconds.

    I watched this movie only as a diversion from the European and American movies I usually watch. I have seen and appreciated many Asian flicks too. But I hardly expected anything like what I actually found. This slice of life is made and performed with such affection and profound feelings that it reached out to the most tender side of every human being thus acquiring a universal appeal. It is a real treat. It is most likely to haunt its viewers long after they've seen it. I never knew Asian Cinema had achieved such high level some 18 years back. It behooves me to now watch all other works of this great director Kai Wai Wong.

    Movie is part fantasy/part reality and you have to determine what's real and what's not. Movie is set in mainland China, the movie is the story of human loneliness and despair from several different perspectives. The movie is a light hearted look at relationships. The song California Dreaming is used very well as the theme to the movie. The movie has a stellar cast with Tony Leung, Takeshi Kaneshiro, Brigette Lin and Faye Wong. Tony Leung is basically the equivalent of a younger Robert DeNiro for Hong Kong/Chinese cinema. Wong Kar Wai's vision of the film is truly mesmerizing and he's truly the most dynamic director from Asia.
