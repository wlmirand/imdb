    Veteran tabloid reporter Miguel Ferrer is on the trail of a savage killer who flies from rural airport to rural airport in search of victims. Soon enough the reporter begins to realize he's pursuing a blood-sucking vampire, Dracula cape and all. Shades of The Night Stalker! At some point, the killer starts warning the reporter off, to no avail. The story takes time to build, and the killer is barely glimpsed until the last five minutes. Keeping him in the shadows until the final confrontation, also done in The Nigh Stalker, pays off big time for the very shocking and bittersweet ending. Ferrer is intense as usual, and the supporting cast is populated by some pretty colorful characters. I was most intrigued by a scene where the reporter, already sensing something supernatural about his prey,finds the killer's empty plane on a tarmac and climbs inside, only to discover the controls rusted and ruined and the entire cockpit saturated with blood.

    Without a doubt, one of my all time favourite films. The Night Flier is an incredibly atmospheric and fabulously gripping film, so-well executed and full of mysterious suspense -- and easily one of the﻿ best Stephen King adaptations to ever be made, in my opinion. So criminally overlooked and underrated for a King adaptation -- a rare﻿ case of where the film version surpasses the source material (The Night Flier, first published as part of an anthology of modern horror in 1988, later became part of King's own collection of short stories, entitled Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993). The film isn't as widely known as it should be, as it didn't have a Hollywood release at the time. HBO bought it so it had it's world premiere on cable. It was then picked up by New Line Cinema and had only a limited theatrical release. Being the mid-1990's, it was not a fertile time for good movie horror. In recent years, it's become something of a cult classic with a big fan following -- myself for one! The Night Flier deserves and needs a Blu-ray release as soon as possible!

    Sometimes, movie adaptations end up totally missing the point of their source material, but this was a very faithful adaptation. In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating. I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing. As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable. I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it: this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious. While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense. Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better. If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

    Master of horror Stephen king has scared you before but never like this, THE NIGHT FLIER is not just a great adaptation but a great film as well and it was refreshing to see an intelligent horror movie and not just another slasher that featured horny teenagers being hacked to death by a machete wielding idiot with a bad childhood, this film deserves the kind of attention that a lot of the crappy blockbusters are getting today, because it is that good. Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time. Overall, its a horror fan's dream, enough said.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.

You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.

    Veteran tabloid reporter Miguel Ferrer is on the trail of a savage killer who flies from rural airport to rural airport in search of victims. Soon enough the reporter begins to realize he's pursuing a blood-sucking vampire, Dracula cape and all. Shades of The Night Stalker! At some point, the killer starts warning the reporter off, to no avail. The story takes time to build, and the killer is barely glimpsed until the last five minutes. Keeping him in the shadows until the final confrontation, also done in The Nigh Stalker, pays off big time for the very shocking and bittersweet ending. Ferrer is intense as usual, and the supporting cast is populated by some pretty colorful characters. I was most intrigued by a scene where the reporter, already sensing something supernatural about his prey,finds the killer's empty plane on a tarmac and climbs inside, only to discover the controls rusted and ruined and the entire cockpit saturated with blood.

    Without a doubt, one of my all time favourite films. The Night Flier is an incredibly atmospheric and fabulously gripping film, so-well executed and full of mysterious suspense -- and easily one of the﻿ best Stephen King adaptations to ever be made, in my opinion. So criminally overlooked and underrated for a King adaptation -- a rare﻿ case of where the film version surpasses the source material (The Night Flier, first published as part of an anthology of modern horror in 1988, later became part of King's own collection of short stories, entitled Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993). The film isn't as widely known as it should be, as it didn't have a Hollywood release at the time. HBO bought it so it had it's world premiere on cable. It was then picked up by New Line Cinema and had only a limited theatrical release. Being the mid-1990's, it was not a fertile time for good movie horror. In recent years, it's become something of a cult classic with a big fan following -- myself for one! The Night Flier deserves and needs a Blu-ray release as soon as possible!

    Sometimes, movie adaptations end up totally missing the point of their source material, but this was a very faithful adaptation. In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating. I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing. As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable. I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it: this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious. While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense. Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better. If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees.

Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.

    Veteran tabloid reporter Miguel Ferrer is on the trail of a savage killer who flies from rural airport to rural airport in search of victims. Soon enough the reporter begins to realize he's pursuing a blood-sucking vampire, Dracula cape and all. Shades of The Night Stalker! At some point, the killer starts warning the reporter off, to no avail. The story takes time to build, and the killer is barely glimpsed until the last five minutes. Keeping him in the shadows until the final confrontation, also done in The Nigh Stalker, pays off big time for the very shocking and bittersweet ending. Ferrer is intense as usual, and the supporting cast is populated by some pretty colorful characters. I was most intrigued by a scene where the reporter, already sensing something supernatural about his prey,finds the killer's empty plane on a tarmac and climbs inside, only to discover the controls rusted and ruined and the entire cockpit saturated with blood.

    Without a doubt, one of my all time favourite films. The Night Flier is an incredibly atmospheric and fabulously gripping film, so-well executed and full of mysterious suspense -- and easily one of the﻿ best Stephen King adaptations to ever be made, in my opinion. So criminally overlooked and underrated for a King adaptation -- a rare﻿ case of where the film version surpasses the source material (The Night Flier, first published as part of an anthology of modern horror in 1988, later became part of King's own collection of short stories, entitled Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993). The film isn't as widely known as it should be, as it didn't have a Hollywood release at the time. HBO bought it so it had it's world premiere on cable. It was then picked up by New Line Cinema and had only a limited theatrical release. Being the mid-1990's, it was not a fertile time for good movie horror. In recent years, it's become something of a cult classic with a big fan following -- myself for one! The Night Flier deserves and needs a Blu-ray release as soon as possible!

    Sometimes, movie adaptations end up totally missing the point of their source material, but this was a very faithful adaptation. In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating. I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing. As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable. I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it: this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious. While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense. Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better. If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

    Master of horror Stephen king has scared you before but never like this, THE NIGHT FLIER is not just a great adaptation but a great film as well and it was refreshing to see an intelligent horror movie and not just another slasher that featured horny teenagers being hacked to death by a machete wielding idiot with a bad childhood, this film deserves the kind of attention that a lot of the crappy blockbusters are getting today, because it is that good. Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time. Overall, its a horror fan's dream, enough said.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims.

If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.

    Veteran tabloid reporter Miguel Ferrer is on the trail of a savage killer who flies from rural airport to rural airport in search of victims. Soon enough the reporter begins to realize he's pursuing a blood-sucking vampire, Dracula cape and all. Shades of The Night Stalker! At some point, the killer starts warning the reporter off, to no avail. The story takes time to build, and the killer is barely glimpsed until the last five minutes. Keeping him in the shadows until the final confrontation, also done in The Nigh Stalker, pays off big time for the very shocking and bittersweet ending. Ferrer is intense as usual, and the supporting cast is populated by some pretty colorful characters. I was most intrigued by a scene where the reporter, already sensing something supernatural about his prey,finds the killer's empty plane on a tarmac and climbs inside, only to discover the controls rusted and ruined and the entire cockpit saturated with blood.

    Without a doubt, one of my all time favourite films. The Night Flier is an incredibly atmospheric and fabulously gripping film, so-well executed and full of mysterious suspense -- and easily one of the﻿ best Stephen King adaptations to ever be made, in my opinion. So criminally overlooked and underrated for a King adaptation -- a rare﻿ case of where the film version surpasses the source material (The Night Flier, first published as part of an anthology of modern horror in 1988, later became part of King's own collection of short stories, entitled Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993). The film isn't as widely known as it should be, as it didn't have a Hollywood release at the time. HBO bought it so it had it's world premiere on cable. It was then picked up by New Line Cinema and had only a limited theatrical release. Being the mid-1990's, it was not a fertile time for good movie horror. In recent years, it's become something of a cult classic with a big fan following -- myself for one! The Night Flier deserves and needs a Blu-ray release as soon as possible!

    Sometimes, movie adaptations end up totally missing the point of their source material, but this was a very faithful adaptation. In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating. I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing. As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable. I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it: this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious. While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense. Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.

    Veteran tabloid reporter Miguel Ferrer is on the trail of a savage killer who flies from rural airport to rural airport in search of victims. Soon enough the reporter begins to realize he's pursuing a blood-sucking vampire, Dracula cape and all. Shades of The Night Stalker! At some point, the killer starts warning the reporter off, to no avail. The story takes time to build, and the killer is barely glimpsed until the last five minutes. Keeping him in the shadows until the final confrontation, also done in The Nigh Stalker, pays off big time for the very shocking and bittersweet ending. Ferrer is intense as usual, and the supporting cast is populated by some pretty colorful characters. I was most intrigued by a scene where the reporter, already sensing something supernatural about his prey,finds the killer's empty plane on a tarmac and climbs inside, only to discover the controls rusted and ruined and the entire cockpit saturated with blood.

    Without a doubt, one of my all time favourite films. The Night Flier is an incredibly atmospheric and fabulously gripping film, so-well executed and full of mysterious suspense -- and easily one of the﻿ best Stephen King adaptations to ever be made, in my opinion. So criminally overlooked and underrated for a King adaptation -- a rare﻿ case of where the film version surpasses the source material (The Night Flier, first published as part of an anthology of modern horror in 1988, later became part of King's own collection of short stories, entitled Nightmares & Dreamscapes in 1993). The film isn't as widely known as it should be, as it didn't have a Hollywood release at the time. HBO bought it so it had it's world premiere on cable. It was then picked up by New Line Cinema and had only a limited theatrical release. Being the mid-1990's, it was not a fertile time for good movie horror. In recent years, it's become something of a cult classic with a big fan following -- myself for one! The Night Flier deserves and needs a Blu-ray release as soon as possible!

    Sometimes, movie adaptations end up totally missing the point of their source material, but this was a very faithful adaptation. In fact, I'd argue that it's probably near the top, as far as faithfulness goes. Unfortunately, there a few things wrong that kind of drag down my rating. I like Miguel Ferrer, so I was pretty excited when I found out that he starred in this movie. As I expected, Ferrer is the high point of the movie. Dees is one of those characters that you love to hate, and he was done to near perfection. Unfortunately, given that film is such a visual medium, it was more difficult to get into Dees' head than the short story, but that's pretty much an obvious and unavoidable issue. Still, Dees' commentary in the short story was the best part, leaving me feeling slightly sad that much of his internal dialogue was missing. As far as the other actors, they were all pretty much passable. None of them were ever bad, at least. A new character was introduced, as a foil to Dees, I suppose. Usually, when this happens, it's a disaster, but I thought it was handled fairly well. Unfortunately, the actress, Julie Entwhisle, was one of the weaker elements in the movie, in my opinion. She wasn't bad, but she wasn't great, either. Dan Monahan, as the editor, played his character as a cheerfully sleazy bastard. I usually dislike comic relief in my horror movies, but it was done well enough here that it didn't bother me. Michael Moss, as the Night Flier, was fine. Other people really seemed to enjoy him, but I did not find his performance particularly memorable. I guess what really bothers me is the plot. This is not unique to the movie, of course. I really don't understand what possessed Stephen King to write a story about a vampire who flies a Cessna. I'll just say it: this is a stupid idea. However, the story really does work, even though the main conceit is too wacky to take seriously. I like how Dees and the vampire serial killer are compared and contrasted, even if it is a bit heavy-handed and lacks subtlety. Nonetheless, it raises interesting questions about morality, ethics, and the role of sociopaths in our society. Still, it's difficult for me to just let go of the ridiculous idea of a vampire flying a Cessna. I mean, really? That reminds me of a hilariously bad European movie I saw once about a haunted elevator. Yes, that's right, it was about a haunted *elevator*. I think it was titled Lift, if you're morbidly curious. While somewhat generic, there are times when the movie does rise above being your average direct-to-video King adaptation. Some of the special effects from KNB are quite good. There's a fairly well-done homage to Night of the Living Dead near the end. Unfortunately, the atmosphere was frequently a bit flat, leaving you with gross-out effects or grisly, black humor, rather than suspense. Certainly, that's not bad, but it makes for a somewhat less fulfilling horror movie. Instead, I think Night Flier works better as an exploitation movie, since it's so lacking in atmosphere, tension, and suspense. Some people were disappointed by the ending, but I found it to be perfectly acceptable and perhaps even satisfying. If I sound a bit unenthused, then keep in mind that many King adaptations end up being dismal failures, and that finding even an average or mediocre one is something of a coup. While not High Art, this is still enjoyable enough to recommend to other King fans, even if they're only familiar with the movie adaptations.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better. If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

    Master of horror Stephen king has scared you before but never like this, THE NIGHT FLIER is not just a great adaptation but a great film as well and it was refreshing to see an intelligent horror movie and not just another slasher that featured horny teenagers being hacked to death by a machete wielding idiot with a bad childhood, this film deserves the kind of attention that a lot of the crappy blockbusters are getting today, because it is that good. Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time. Overall, its a horror fan's dream, enough said.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    For something based on a Stephen King short story, that looks and sounds like an overly long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", has shockingly little sex and violence, and features a villain who is laugh out loud ludicrous if you think about it, The Night Flier is a stunningly good piece of work. It is honestly creepy, bluntly engrossing and steam powered by a great character and an equally accomplished performance. This is one of those movies where you're waiting for it to suck and instead, it keeps getting better. If I told you this film was about a tabloid reporter chasing after a vampire who wears a full-on Dracula outfit, complete with cape, and pilots a tiny, prop-engine plane from small town airport to small town airport, feasting on the middle-aged and elderlyadmit it. That sounds like the premise of a horror parody, doesn't it? I mean, a real vampire who dresses like a Bela Lugosi impersonator? And he doesn't fly by turning into a bat, but by strapping himself into the cockpit of something that looks like a pair of wings got slapped onto a VW hippie van? And he sucks the blood, not from nubile lasses but from members of AARP? Does that sound scary to you? And yet, The Night Flier is one of the more genuinely entertaining horror films I've ever seen. Largely, that's due to the central character of Richard Dees and the snarling integrity Miguel Ferrer gives him. Dees is a veteran reporter for the sort of tabloid rag that wallows in blood, scandal and outrage of all kind. He is also one of the most unrelenting pricks in the history of cinema and Ferrer fills Dees to bursting with insolent, impotent distemper. He has nothing but contempt for all the other people of the world and their delicate sensitivities. Dees is such a thorough-going bastard and Ferrer is so unflinching in his portrayal that the character blasts through any viewer enmity and becomes an admirable figure. You wouldn't want to be sitting next to a son of a bitch like Dees in a bar, but he's exactly the sort of man you want trying to uncover difficult and ugly truths. And whether Dees is jousting with his wickedly jaded editor (Dan Monahan) and a perky female reporter (Julie Entwisle) or slowing unraveling the mystery of The Night Flier, you can't take your eyes off him. If you're looking for non-stop gore, flesh being shredded and disgusting perversion, you'll not find it here. The language is R-rated but the violence is no worse than what can be seen on most network TV cop procedural shows. The emphasis is on suspense and the smoldering anger of Richard Dees. The plot is also pretty simple, with Dees following in the footsteps of The Night Flier until he finally catches up to him. Like I mentioned, this resembles nothing so much as a good, 97 minute long episode of "Tales from the Darkside", right up to the little twist at the end. This is a horror movie made by people who refuse to accept that the genre is only meant to appeal to unthinking teens and nihilistic freaks. They believe horror is for everyone and can engage them on more than the visceral level. It's a stark reminder of how messed up, degenerate and decadent horror films have become. So, The Night Flier isn't just a good movie. It has socially redeeming value, in addition to a buck-toothed blood sucker. What more can you ask for?

    First read "Night Flier" in the collection "Prime Evil" (which was a great read) so I happened upon the film version at Blockbuster and checked it out. Miguel Ferrer is Richard Dees, a cynical and jaded reporter for a "National Enquirer"-esquire rag called the "Inside View". His tough-guy attitude brings him into conflict with new reporter Katherine, who he calls Jimmy ("as in Olson"). The two are ultimately paired together for the investigation into a killer called "The Night Flier", a strange killer who picks off the operators of small airports. Dees' investigation leads him into a desperate, insane attempt to recapture the front page, and find the killer. Ferrer is simply fantastic as Dees, as is the whole film. The other actors do a great job and the film overall is very enjoyable. The creature effects at the end were believable and scary. The ending itself was really creepy, the vision of Dees' hell was a truly haunting scene in my book. All in all a very good watch. Great on a cold Saturday night.

    I'd like to add my own comment to this movie because I have some personal fondness for it. The reviews around here aren't so unfavorable either, but I'd like to up the praise a little. I'll also keep this spoiler-free, how about that. So what do I like about "The Night Flier"? a. Overall atmosphere. Right from the start, there is a thick air of mystery. Sometimes it retreats into the background, but it never goes away. It's not only mystery, but also a presence of the supernatural; an awareness of some being with more than human powers. b. Music. Supports the atmosphere very nicely. This applies especially to what you could call the main theme - the theme of the night flier's plane. c. Tempo. Almost perfect, just slightly on the slow side here and there maybe. d. Characters. The different reporter characters - especially our "special couple" (you'll understand when you watch the movie) - bounce off each other perfectly. Add their respective relationships to the evil guy - and to evil in general -, and you have fertile soil for an interesting story. e. Story. Following up on item d, yes, an interesting story was indeed written - mostly by Stephen King I guess (haven't read his book). f. Cast. Interesting actors. It's got Miguel Ferrer in it, and he fits his role 100%. Also, I love that plane repair hick and the way he talks. It's just quirky and cool. Oh, and the villain's voice: Genius - pure genius. g. Acting. Good. Just good. Can't complain about anyone really. h. Repeated viewability. I've watched this flick quite a few times now, and it still grasps me. I do skip some of the scenes anyway. Some of the stuff is decidedly too graphic for my taste. i. Source of inspiration. "The Night Flier" teaches a lot about people who seek to understand the extremes in the world: the best and the worst. Well, the movie focuses more on the latter. As for criticism: My only complaint might concern the ending. It's a bit over the top and I didn't quite like the resolution they came up with. Watching "The Night Flier", for me, is a kind of redeeming experience. Maybe it will be for you too? When the voice of the evil flier (or God masquerading as such) woos you, you'll know you're called and you'll know what to do: Go to your favorite movie outlet and ask for: The Night Flier.

    Master of horror Stephen king has scared you before but never like this, THE NIGHT FLIER is not just a great adaptation but a great film as well and it was refreshing to see an intelligent horror movie and not just another slasher that featured horny teenagers being hacked to death by a machete wielding idiot with a bad childhood, this film deserves the kind of attention that a lot of the crappy blockbusters are getting today, because it is that good. Obviously I'm not going to add a synopsis, I hardly ever do, the best way to watch this film is to go in by forgetting everything you've possibly heard about it whether it be good or bad and watch it as if you just discovered it for the first time. Overall, its a horror fan's dream, enough said.

    I really enjoyed this movie a lot. It's about this news paper reporter named Richard Dees and he is losing slack because his stories are not being printed on the front page as much. He works for this newspaper that prints really weird stories like aliens and stuff. Then along comes a story and Richard becomes obsessed with and it takes over his whole life. Even though he warned a rookie reporter than she shouldn't become like him. The horror movie is a little different from other horror movies that I've watched before. It has some twists and turns in it that are pretty cool but not too amazing. I liked that it was raining all the time. That just made it so much creepier.

    Of all of King's adaptations this one has to rank up there rather high as far as following the story. Granted it has a few add ons and a different ending, but these actually enhance the story more rather than take away. The story has a writer of a trashy tabloid on a hunt for a strange owner of a small aircraft. Seems where this person sets his plane down there are deaths and misfortune. A young upstart female reporter is also on this case. Well it is rather easy to figure out what the night flier is and what he is doing, but it is still fun watching the process. It all leads to one very bloody conclusion and a rather nice ending. The acting is fairly good for what amounts to a rather low budget movie and the effects are rather good too. They did not spread this one out to long as this one moves at a very quick place and it does not have many dull moments. Most of the super bloody scenes occur at the end though, as most of the movie is the reporter one step behind the night flier with him interviewing people in airports the night flier has touched down in. Various flashback scenes and such. All in all not a great movie, but a fairly good Stephen King film.

    I have to say one of my choices as a horror sleeper from the 90's is this little creepy grisly effort from director Mark Pavia, based on a Stephen King story, regarding a narcissistic, manipulative, and ultimately vicious tabloid reporter who'll stoop to the lowest level to keep his story on the front page, meeting his match when he begins tailing a vampire killer flying a black Cessna plane who hypnotizes victims around plane air strips throughout Northeastern United States, the rural routes of small town America. At the bottom of his plane is maggot-filled earth, and inside, smeared throughout the controls is dried blood, collected over the his time of mutilation and death. Julie Entwisle, just a bubbly, high-spirited cutie presented as the perfect little fish to be devoured by Miguel Ferrer's cunning shark, tries to forge her way into the tabloid's upper tier, starting from the bottom with a key ability to get forms of information difficult to reach for the paper's top piranha. Anyway, we see as he flies in his own plane from destination to destination, Ferrer's Richard Dees working through the first murder sites, gathering bits and pieces from whatever he can find, through testimony and bribing coroners for photos of mutilated victims. We also get a chance to see his ways of flamboyant journalism by disturbing a victim's grave, adding ugly dead flowers and his own blood(..while even stooping so low as to move the gravestone)..everything is for getting the top story printed with extra spice. I think the idea of the main character being a real slimeball could hurt the film for many because it's much easier to cast a likable hero who we feel sympathy for as he/she pursues the killer leaving a graphic trail of gruesome murders, with throats ripped open so badly that the head is pulled apart from the neck displaying bloody flesh. There's even one scene where the head is ripped completely from the body, placed in an appropriate area as to show those who investigate that the vampire can operate without restraint almost teasing the authorities to catch him. The opening kill shows long gashes down a male victim's face..good, gory carnage is left in this vampire's wake. The closing sequence is one that receives mixed reaction. I've read from some who love it, believing it's the most effective portion of the movie, while others believe it's the most harmful. I particularly love the scene where we have Dees, after finally becoming sickened by the airport lobby slaughter by the vampire, watching from the mirror as the invisible count takes a leak, with the urine being blood red..haha, nice touch. The B&W portion where Dees confronts victims, dressed as vampires, as the count allows him to see what it's like from the other side, I thought was a nifty little moment of nightmarish power. I think we have been spoiled rotten by DVD special features, given access into the movie-making behind-the-scenes effects process. For some, the practical effects of gore, displaying the killer's grisly methods, will receive less of an impact, but I enjoyed them even though I know how they are brought to life(..I think for some, the nasty open wounds from the vampire's finger nails look less effective, and we can understand how they were created). I think the casting of Ferrer is ideal just because of the type of character he portrays. He indeed has a taste for bloody carnage and the vampire, through the final climactic sequence, first seeing the wake of violence of an entire group of people awaiting a trip to some unknown destination, and the B@W vision through a taste of the killer's blood, gives him an opportunity to experience just that. The audience does get what they crave, this bastard's comeuppance. He wanted that front page and gets it, but this time, Entwisle's young reporter(..who gets shafted by Dees)benefits. It's a fitting conclusion, I think, which speaks volumes for why this film must have an anti-hero as the main protagonist. I like how the film presents Dees, the backstories of those with stories to tell of past victims to him, the sleazy process of how he operates, and the way Dees falls to the one warning him to stay away. I loved the ending with how Dees, who basks in exploiting whatever works to bring him success, becomes the victim.
