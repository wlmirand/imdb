 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Kate is working on a career at Mercer Advertising but is passed up for promotion because she's 'not stable enough', still being single and having no ties to the company. A story is made up about her being engaged to Nick, a guy whom she just met at a friend's wedding, and all seems to work out well for Kate. She even gets the attention of a colleague she had always wanted, but events soon take a dramatic turn, forcing her to 'present' her alleged fiance to her boss.

    A bland 'Green Card' rip-off with Jennifer Aniston as an advertising executive who ropes wedding videographer Jay Mohr into pretending to be her fianc&eacute; so she can appear more suitable for a big promotion, and into the bargain convince womaniser Kevin Bacon that she can be a bad girl so he'll sleep with her. We're supposed to sympathise with Aniston's character, so perhaps making her a selfish, manipulative schemer wasn't the best way of going about it; sure, she confesses to her bad points at the end of the film, but even then she interrupts a wedding to do it! The only spark to be found in this formulaic dross comes not from Bacon, as I expected, but Mohr, who somehow manages to flesh out his underwritten character.

    The first and best of Jennifer Aniston's string of comedies. She is sprightly and charming and the film light and airy. What really carries this over and makes it better than the host of pale films that have come after is Jay Mohr. He is ingratiating and sweet, he has always been better as sweethearts although he can play a jerk well, and the chemistry between the two of them is much better than she has shared with most of her other leading men. A high grade supporting cast adds to the pleasure of this, Olympia Dukakis is a delight as Jennifer's brassy mom, the always dependable Ileana Douglas fun as her friend, Kevin Bacon has a snarky charm as the office gigolo and Kevin Dunn offers a nice turn as her boss.

    Glenn Gordon Caron's 'Picture Perfect' is A Decent Rom-Com, that entertains. Also, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. 'Picture Perfect' Synopsis: Kate is working on a career at Mercer Advertising but is passed up for promotion because she's not stable enough, still being single and having no ties to the company. A story is made up about her being engaged to Nick, a guy whom she just met at a friend's wedding, and all seems to work out well for Kate. She even gets the attention of a colleague she had always wanted, but events soon take a dramatic turn. 'Picture Perfect' begins & ends on a light note. Being a Rom-Com, this 1997 flick offers good humor & breezy moments. Glenn Gordon Caron's Direction is good. As mentioned before, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. Aniston makes a lovable protagonist, while Bacon once again proves, that he can never disappoint. Another likable performance comes from Jay Mohr. On the whole, 'Picture Perfect' isn't perfect, but a decent & light film nonetheless.

    I'm pretty sure that the title was created before the plot, because the plot is a bit forced. Kate (Jennifer Aniston) works in advertising but can't really progress in her job because everybody else has a nice stable marriage and a house of their own, and she's unlucky in love and still staying with her mother. Her good girl image is also a turn off for her sexy adulterous boss, Sam (Kevin Bacon). So when a friend sees a photo of her taken at a friend's wedding with a friend of the groom's, she concludes that the two are a couple. Kate then invents a fictitious engagement to the man, Nick, (Jay Mohr)who she had never met before the wedding. It impresses her colleagues and bags her Sam. Kate pays Nick to pose as her fictitious man but her plan gets screwed up a little when he falls in love with her. I know that the advertising industry might be concerned with the 'image' of employees but I doubt that they would imply that being single and living with your mother meant that you had no career path. I'm pretty sure that you could sue for the implication that your love life and where you live prevents you from promotion. Anyway, the opposite tends to be true- the married couples are likely to leave and have children. Also, Kate must earn enough to get her own flat and surely if she's worked up to a good position in the company, she's got a bit of independence and drive? She seems to have quite a few psychological issues. Jennifer Aniston acquits herself well in a movie that probably is just a vehicle for her. Though if you don't think much of her, this film probably won't change your opinion. Kevin Bacon is actually quite good as Sam- and he makes a nice bit of eye candy, of course (though the hair is BAD). Jay Mohr doesn't have that much to do but he plays the cardboard cut-out nice guy quite sweetly. As I said previously, the plot has holes but in formulaic rom-coms this is sort of expected. However the comedy in this film is intermittent. It starts off as lightly amusing but this is abandoned for a more serious romantic tone (it's rather depressing in places as well), which spoils the fun a little, seeing as both Bacon and Aniston show that they could have handled a rom-com script. The soundtrack/score is pretty dull and a bit dated as well. If you're in the mood for a soppy non-taxing romance, this would do the job, and if you like the leading actors, it's worth a watch. If you like Maid in Manhatten, you'll probably like this as well (probably more). But if you're looking for a light rom-com, you might be disappointed.

    From director Glenn Gordon Caron, "Picture Perfect" is a predictable, everyday romantic comedy that is lifted above the drudgery by the movie's bright cast alone. Jennifer Aniston is a fresh, enjoyable movie newcomer. She plays well the frustrated career woman who can't get her job or her relationships sorted out. Jay Mohr is the nice guy who tapes weddings for a living and Kevin Bacon is the sleazy Sam, a guy who sticks to unavailable women to avoid commitment. Likable support from Ileana Douglas, Olympia Dukakis (though not at her best) and Kevin Dunn. Tuesday, April 25, 2000 - Video

    *** contains spoilers *** I watched this as an Instant Play on Netflix. I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, so I gave it a shot. I won't say that Picture Perfect was completely awful because I did watch it all the way through. I will say that this film paints humanity in an ugly light. Kate is utterly self-centered, showing the total lack of awareness of others. The entire film is predicated on the decisions she makes out of her self-centeredness. Even the "happy ending" depends on Kate's lack of awareness for anyone else but herself. It doesn't occur to her that she's ruining a stranger's wedding because she can't wait 30 minutes to get out her apologies. The film's writer insults the viewer by assuming that because Kate manages a few tender moments while she's being selfish, we then are supposed to be endeared to her. Nick shows no dignity for his own self. The more he gets to know the self-centered Kate, the more he falls in love with her?? She insults him with her proposal, she is disrespectful and rude to him, she shows weak moral character by her "affair" with a colleague who is using her for thrill-sex... and yet, he professes that he likes her more and more. The viewers are expected to endear ourselves to him too. Kate's colleague, played by Kevin Bacon, only sleeps with women who are married or otherwise committed. Enough said. Kate's boss only shows his female staff respect based on whether or not they are "stable", which in this case is determined by whether or not Kate is showing signs that she's in a committed relationship. Kate's friend encourages her to lie and cheat in order to fool her boss into thinking she's "stable". Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her. Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless. Don't be tempted to watch this. Whether it's intended or not, the film ends up being a commentary about the inherent selfishness of and lack of self-dignity in humanity.

    I read a little bit of the review for this film, and it did sound like something I might like, and I had my predictions of how the plot would go, so I gave it a shot. Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    A consistent homage to all the 'values' that have brought the credit crunch to the USA and UK. Selfishness and shallowness portrayed as acceptable and lovable characteristics. The underlying theme being that it is fine to lie, cheat, get into debt, deceive your closest friends and it will all work out fine - as long as you really really want whatever it is you are prepared to lie, cheat and deceive about. A career woman, uses a nice person, a stranger she meets at a wedding, shows no interest in him as a human being and despite saying 'I don't want you to feel like a thing' goes on to treat him exactly as a 'thing'. A prop to help her get what she wants. What she wants is to sleep with a serial womaniser, to get promotion and higher pay and that's about it really. Then when she gets them she decides they aren't as shiny as she thought they'd be and wants the 'thing/stranger/wedding guy' to be her permanent plaything instead. She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child. Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice. Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job. For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film. The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future. So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least. But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

    It may be unfair to label Picture Perfect a RomCom. It certainly sits at the less frivolous, more acutely observed end of the spectrum within the genre. There are some small but brilliant moments here, mostly to do with rom rather than com. When Aniston attends the wedding and the bouquet is to be thrown, she steps forward to find herself the only single woman in the room. It is quite poignant, and her retort - "Oh, just hand me the damn thing!" - plays the scene out beautifully. The fight in the restaurant, when it does come, is a masterclass in infusing sub-text into dialogue. Aninston holds it all together with ease, Kevin Bacon is superbly vacuous as the office beefcake, and Jay Mohr does a decent shift, especially when called upon to hint at deeper feelings for career-driven Kate. The ending reverts to by-the-numbers RomCom proceedings, but there is enough in the build-up to have you give up some smiles and tears that you'll feel the film earned.

    An Aniston vehicle, released at the very height of Friends' success on telly. It's a sunny, back-to-front romcom after Green Card, for example, in which Kate (Aniston) uses a guy she meets at a wedding to advance her career. Like most men on the planet, Jay Mohr's Nick can't simply play the attendant fianc&eacute; though and the complications bring things to a head, nicely resolved in one of the least likely, contrived, wedding-themed conclusions I've seen in this kind of flick. Mad. Illeana Douglas and Kevin Douglas are the stalwart, bankable support and Mohr is capably riding the surf of being the chief antagonist of predecessor Jerry Maguire. The film is all about Aniston though. She's a good actress giving the flimsy conceit some body. Speaking of body, she's also sufficiently aware of her own appeal to wear a second-act dress a size too small, as well as no bra in the denouement. Oh and Kevin Bacon's in it too. As I say, mad. 3/10

She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child. Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice. Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job. For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film. The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future. So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least. But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

    It may be unfair to label Picture Perfect a RomCom. It certainly sits at the less frivolous, more acutely observed end of the spectrum within the genre. There are some small but brilliant moments here, mostly to do with rom rather than com. When Aniston attends the wedding and the bouquet is to be thrown, she steps forward to find herself the only single woman in the room. It is quite poignant, and her retort - "Oh, just hand me the damn thing!" - plays the scene out beautifully. The fight in the restaurant, when it does come, is a masterclass in infusing sub-text into dialogue. Aninston holds it all together with ease, Kevin Bacon is superbly vacuous as the office beefcake, and Jay Mohr does a decent shift, especially when called upon to hint at deeper feelings for career-driven Kate. The ending reverts to by-the-numbers RomCom proceedings, but there is enough in the build-up to have you give up some smiles and tears that you'll feel the film earned.

    An Aniston vehicle, released at the very height of Friends' success on telly. It's a sunny, back-to-front romcom after Green Card, for example, in which Kate (Aniston) uses a guy she meets at a wedding to advance her career. Like most men on the planet, Jay Mohr's Nick can't simply play the attendant fianc&eacute; though and the complications bring things to a head, nicely resolved in one of the least likely, contrived, wedding-themed conclusions I've seen in this kind of flick. Mad. Illeana Douglas and Kevin Douglas are the stalwart, bankable support and Mohr is capably riding the surf of being the chief antagonist of predecessor Jerry Maguire. The film is all about Aniston though. She's a good actress giving the flimsy conceit some body. Speaking of body, she's also sufficiently aware of her own appeal to wear a second-act dress a size too small, as well as no bra in the denouement. Oh and Kevin Bacon's in it too. As I say, mad. 3/10

    A bland 'Green Card' rip-off with Jennifer Aniston as an advertising executive who ropes wedding videographer Jay Mohr into pretending to be her fianc&eacute; so she can appear more suitable for a big promotion, and into the bargain convince womaniser Kevin Bacon that she can be a bad girl so he'll sleep with her. We're supposed to sympathise with Aniston's character, so perhaps making her a selfish, manipulative schemer wasn't the best way of going about it; sure, she confesses to her bad points at the end of the film, but even then she interrupts a wedding to do it! The only spark to be found in this formulaic dross comes not from Bacon, as I expected, but Mohr, who somehow manages to flesh out his underwritten character.

    The first and best of Jennifer Aniston's string of comedies. She is sprightly and charming and the film light and airy. What really carries this over and makes it better than the host of pale films that have come after is Jay Mohr. He is ingratiating and sweet, he has always been better as sweethearts although he can play a jerk well, and the chemistry between the two of them is much better than she has shared with most of her other leading men. A high grade supporting cast adds to the pleasure of this, Olympia Dukakis is a delight as Jennifer's brassy mom, the always dependable Ileana Douglas fun as her friend, Kevin Bacon has a snarky charm as the office gigolo and Kevin Dunn offers a nice turn as her boss.

    Glenn Gordon Caron's 'Picture Perfect' is A Decent Rom-Com, that entertains. Also, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. 'Picture Perfect' Synopsis: Kate is working on a career at Mercer Advertising but is passed up for promotion because she's not stable enough, still being single and having no ties to the company. A story is made up about her being engaged to Nick, a guy whom she just met at a friend's wedding, and all seems to work out well for Kate. She even gets the attention of a colleague she had always wanted, but events soon take a dramatic turn. 'Picture Perfect' begins & ends on a light note. Being a Rom-Com, this 1997 flick offers good humor & breezy moments. Glenn Gordon Caron's Direction is good. As mentioned before, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. Aniston makes a lovable protagonist, while Bacon once again proves, that he can never disappoint. Another likable performance comes from Jay Mohr. On the whole, 'Picture Perfect' isn't perfect, but a decent & light film nonetheless.

    I'm pretty sure that the title was created before the plot, because the plot is a bit forced. Kate (Jennifer Aniston) works in advertising but can't really progress in her job because everybody else has a nice stable marriage and a house of their own, and she's unlucky in love and still staying with her mother. Her good girl image is also a turn off for her sexy adulterous boss, Sam (Kevin Bacon). So when a friend sees a photo of her taken at a friend's wedding with a friend of the groom's, she concludes that the two are a couple. Kate then invents a fictitious engagement to the man, Nick, (Jay Mohr)who she had never met before the wedding. It impresses her colleagues and bags her Sam. Kate pays Nick to pose as her fictitious man but her plan gets screwed up a little when he falls in love with her. I know that the advertising industry might be concerned with the 'image' of employees but I doubt that they would imply that being single and living with your mother meant that you had no career path. I'm pretty sure that you could sue for the implication that your love life and where you live prevents you from promotion. Anyway, the opposite tends to be true- the married couples are likely to leave and have children. Also, Kate must earn enough to get her own flat and surely if she's worked up to a good position in the company, she's got a bit of independence and drive? She seems to have quite a few psychological issues. Jennifer Aniston acquits herself well in a movie that probably is just a vehicle for her. Though if you don't think much of her, this film probably won't change your opinion. Kevin Bacon is actually quite good as Sam- and he makes a nice bit of eye candy, of course (though the hair is BAD). Jay Mohr doesn't have that much to do but he plays the cardboard cut-out nice guy quite sweetly. As I said previously, the plot has holes but in formulaic rom-coms this is sort of expected. However the comedy in this film is intermittent. It starts off as lightly amusing but this is abandoned for a more serious romantic tone (it's rather depressing in places as well), which spoils the fun a little, seeing as both Bacon and Aniston show that they could have handled a rom-com script. The soundtrack/score is pretty dull and a bit dated as well. If you're in the mood for a soppy non-taxing romance, this would do the job, and if you like the leading actors, it's worth a watch. If you like Maid in Manhatten, you'll probably like this as well (probably more). But if you're looking for a light rom-com, you might be disappointed.

    From director Glenn Gordon Caron, "Picture Perfect" is a predictable, everyday romantic comedy that is lifted above the drudgery by the movie's bright cast alone. Jennifer Aniston is a fresh, enjoyable movie newcomer. She plays well the frustrated career woman who can't get her job or her relationships sorted out. Jay Mohr is the nice guy who tapes weddings for a living and Kevin Bacon is the sleazy Sam, a guy who sticks to unavailable women to avoid commitment. Likable support from Ileana Douglas, Olympia Dukakis (though not at her best) and Kevin Dunn. Tuesday, April 25, 2000 - Video

    *** contains spoilers *** I watched this as an Instant Play on Netflix. I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, so I gave it a shot. I won't say that Picture Perfect was completely awful because I did watch it all the way through. I will say that this film paints humanity in an ugly light. Kate is utterly self-centered, showing the total lack of awareness of others. The entire film is predicated on the decisions she makes out of her self-centeredness. Even the "happy ending" depends on Kate's lack of awareness for anyone else but herself. It doesn't occur to her that she's ruining a stranger's wedding because she can't wait 30 minutes to get out her apologies. The film's writer insults the viewer by assuming that because Kate manages a few tender moments while she's being selfish, we then are supposed to be endeared to her. Nick shows no dignity for his own self. The more he gets to know the self-centered Kate, the more he falls in love with her?? She insults him with her proposal, she is disrespectful and rude to him, she shows weak moral character by her "affair" with a colleague who is using her for thrill-sex... and yet, he professes that he likes her more and more. The viewers are expected to endear ourselves to him too. Kate's colleague, played by Kevin Bacon, only sleeps with women who are married or otherwise committed. Enough said. Kate's boss only shows his female staff respect based on whether or not they are "stable", which in this case is determined by whether or not Kate is showing signs that she's in a committed relationship. Kate's friend encourages her to lie and cheat in order to fool her boss into thinking she's "stable". Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her. Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless. Don't be tempted to watch this. Whether it's intended or not, the film ends up being a commentary about the inherent selfishness of and lack of self-dignity in humanity.

    I read a little bit of the review for this film, and it did sound like something I might like, and I had my predictions of how the plot would go, so I gave it a shot. Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    A consistent homage to all the 'values' that have brought the credit crunch to the USA and UK. Selfishness and shallowness portrayed as acceptable and lovable characteristics. The underlying theme being that it is fine to lie, cheat, get into debt, deceive your closest friends and it will all work out fine - as long as you really really want whatever it is you are prepared to lie, cheat and deceive about. A career woman, uses a nice person, a stranger she meets at a wedding, shows no interest in him as a human being and despite saying 'I don't want you to feel like a thing' goes on to treat him exactly as a 'thing'. A prop to help her get what she wants. What she wants is to sleep with a serial womaniser, to get promotion and higher pay and that's about it really. Then when she gets them she decides they aren't as shiny as she thought they'd be and wants the 'thing/stranger/wedding guy' to be her permanent plaything instead. She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child. Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice. Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job. For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film. The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future. So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least. But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    A consistent homage to all the 'values' that have brought the credit crunch to the USA and UK. Selfishness and shallowness portrayed as acceptable and lovable characteristics. The underlying theme being that it is fine to lie, cheat, get into debt, deceive your closest friends and it will all work out fine - as long as you really really want whatever it is you are prepared to lie, cheat and deceive about. A career woman, uses a nice person, a stranger she meets at a wedding, shows no interest in him as a human being and despite saying 'I don't want you to feel like a thing' goes on to treat him exactly as a 'thing'. A prop to help her get what she wants. What she wants is to sleep with a serial womaniser, to get promotion and higher pay and that's about it really. Then when she gets them she decides they aren't as shiny as she thought they'd be and wants the 'thing/stranger/wedding guy' to be her permanent plaything instead. She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child. Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice. Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job. For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film. The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future. So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least. But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

    It may be unfair to label Picture Perfect a RomCom. It certainly sits at the less frivolous, more acutely observed end of the spectrum within the genre. There are some small but brilliant moments here, mostly to do with rom rather than com. When Aniston attends the wedding and the bouquet is to be thrown, she steps forward to find herself the only single woman in the room. It is quite poignant, and her retort - "Oh, just hand me the damn thing!" - plays the scene out beautifully. The fight in the restaurant, when it does come, is a masterclass in infusing sub-text into dialogue. Aninston holds it all together with ease, Kevin Bacon is superbly vacuous as the office beefcake, and Jay Mohr does a decent shift, especially when called upon to hint at deeper feelings for career-driven Kate. The ending reverts to by-the-numbers RomCom proceedings, but there is enough in the build-up to have you give up some smiles and tears that you'll feel the film earned.

    An Aniston vehicle, released at the very height of Friends' success on telly. It's a sunny, back-to-front romcom after Green Card, for example, in which Kate (Aniston) uses a guy she meets at a wedding to advance her career. Like most men on the planet, Jay Mohr's Nick can't simply play the attendant fianc&eacute; though and the complications bring things to a head, nicely resolved in one of the least likely, contrived, wedding-themed conclusions I've seen in this kind of flick. Mad. Illeana Douglas and Kevin Douglas are the stalwart, bankable support and Mohr is capably riding the surf of being the chief antagonist of predecessor Jerry Maguire. The film is all about Aniston though. She's a good actress giving the flimsy conceit some body. Speaking of body, she's also sufficiently aware of her own appeal to wear a second-act dress a size too small, as well as no bra in the denouement. Oh and Kevin Bacon's in it too. As I say, mad. 3/10

    A bland 'Green Card' rip-off with Jennifer Aniston as an advertising executive who ropes wedding videographer Jay Mohr into pretending to be her fianc&eacute; so she can appear more suitable for a big promotion, and into the bargain convince womaniser Kevin Bacon that she can be a bad girl so he'll sleep with her. We're supposed to sympathise with Aniston's character, so perhaps making her a selfish, manipulative schemer wasn't the best way of going about it; sure, she confesses to her bad points at the end of the film, but even then she interrupts a wedding to do it! The only spark to be found in this formulaic dross comes not from Bacon, as I expected, but Mohr, who somehow manages to flesh out his underwritten character.

    The first and best of Jennifer Aniston's string of comedies. She is sprightly and charming and the film light and airy. What really carries this over and makes it better than the host of pale films that have come after is Jay Mohr. He is ingratiating and sweet, he has always been better as sweethearts although he can play a jerk well, and the chemistry between the two of them is much better than she has shared with most of her other leading men. A high grade supporting cast adds to the pleasure of this, Olympia Dukakis is a delight as Jennifer's brassy mom, the always dependable Ileana Douglas fun as her friend, Kevin Bacon has a snarky charm as the office gigolo and Kevin Dunn offers a nice turn as her boss.

    Glenn Gordon Caron's 'Picture Perfect' is A Decent Rom-Com, that entertains. Also, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. 'Picture Perfect' Synopsis: Kate is working on a career at Mercer Advertising but is passed up for promotion because she's not stable enough, still being single and having no ties to the company. A story is made up about her being engaged to Nick, a guy whom she just met at a friend's wedding, and all seems to work out well for Kate. She even gets the attention of a colleague she had always wanted, but events soon take a dramatic turn. 'Picture Perfect' begins & ends on a light note. Being a Rom-Com, this 1997 flick offers good humor & breezy moments. Glenn Gordon Caron's Direction is good. As mentioned before, Jennifer Aniston & The Ever-Amazing Kevin Bacon give spirited performances. Aniston makes a lovable protagonist, while Bacon once again proves, that he can never disappoint. Another likable performance comes from Jay Mohr. On the whole, 'Picture Perfect' isn't perfect, but a decent & light film nonetheless.

    I'm pretty sure that the title was created before the plot, because the plot is a bit forced. Kate (Jennifer Aniston) works in advertising but can't really progress in her job because everybody else has a nice stable marriage and a house of their own, and she's unlucky in love and still staying with her mother. Her good girl image is also a turn off for her sexy adulterous boss, Sam (Kevin Bacon). So when a friend sees a photo of her taken at a friend's wedding with a friend of the groom's, she concludes that the two are a couple. Kate then invents a fictitious engagement to the man, Nick, (Jay Mohr)who she had never met before the wedding. It impresses her colleagues and bags her Sam. Kate pays Nick to pose as her fictitious man but her plan gets screwed up a little when he falls in love with her. I know that the advertising industry might be concerned with the 'image' of employees but I doubt that they would imply that being single and living with your mother meant that you had no career path. I'm pretty sure that you could sue for the implication that your love life and where you live prevents you from promotion. Anyway, the opposite tends to be true- the married couples are likely to leave and have children. Also, Kate must earn enough to get her own flat and surely if she's worked up to a good position in the company, she's got a bit of independence and drive? She seems to have quite a few psychological issues. Jennifer Aniston acquits herself well in a movie that probably is just a vehicle for her. Though if you don't think much of her, this film probably won't change your opinion. Kevin Bacon is actually quite good as Sam- and he makes a nice bit of eye candy, of course (though the hair is BAD). Jay Mohr doesn't have that much to do but he plays the cardboard cut-out nice guy quite sweetly. As I said previously, the plot has holes but in formulaic rom-coms this is sort of expected. However the comedy in this film is intermittent. It starts off as lightly amusing but this is abandoned for a more serious romantic tone (it's rather depressing in places as well), which spoils the fun a little, seeing as both Bacon and Aniston show that they could have handled a rom-com script. The soundtrack/score is pretty dull and a bit dated as well. If you're in the mood for a soppy non-taxing romance, this would do the job, and if you like the leading actors, it's worth a watch. If you like Maid in Manhatten, you'll probably like this as well (probably more). But if you're looking for a light rom-com, you might be disappointed.

    From director Glenn Gordon Caron, "Picture Perfect" is a predictable, everyday romantic comedy that is lifted above the drudgery by the movie's bright cast alone. Jennifer Aniston is a fresh, enjoyable movie newcomer. She plays well the frustrated career woman who can't get her job or her relationships sorted out. Jay Mohr is the nice guy who tapes weddings for a living and Kevin Bacon is the sleazy Sam, a guy who sticks to unavailable women to avoid commitment. Likable support from Ileana Douglas, Olympia Dukakis (though not at her best) and Kevin Dunn. Tuesday, April 25, 2000 - Video

    *** contains spoilers *** I watched this as an Instant Play on Netflix. I enjoy the romantic comedy genre, so I gave it a shot. I won't say that Picture Perfect was completely awful because I did watch it all the way through. I will say that this film paints humanity in an ugly light. Kate is utterly self-centered, showing the total lack of awareness of others. The entire film is predicated on the decisions she makes out of her self-centeredness. Even the "happy ending" depends on Kate's lack of awareness for anyone else but herself. It doesn't occur to her that she's ruining a stranger's wedding because she can't wait 30 minutes to get out her apologies. The film's writer insults the viewer by assuming that because Kate manages a few tender moments while she's being selfish, we then are supposed to be endeared to her. Nick shows no dignity for his own self. The more he gets to know the self-centered Kate, the more he falls in love with her?? She insults him with her proposal, she is disrespectful and rude to him, she shows weak moral character by her "affair" with a colleague who is using her for thrill-sex... and yet, he professes that he likes her more and more. The viewers are expected to endear ourselves to him too. Kate's colleague, played by Kevin Bacon, only sleeps with women who are married or otherwise committed. Enough said. Kate's boss only shows his female staff respect based on whether or not they are "stable", which in this case is determined by whether or not Kate is showing signs that she's in a committed relationship. Kate's friend encourages her to lie and cheat in order to fool her boss into thinking she's "stable". Kate's mom is portrayed as an overbearing mother whose self-worth depends on the constant reassurance that her daughter cares about her. Kate's other work colleagues are portrayed as gossip-mongering and thoughtless. Don't be tempted to watch this. Whether it's intended or not, the film ends up being a commentary about the inherent selfishness of and lack of self-dignity in humanity.

    I read a little bit of the review for this film, and it did sound like something I might like, and I had my predictions of how the plot would go, so I gave it a shot. Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    I read a little bit of the review for this film, and it did sound like something I might like, and I had my predictions of how the plot would go, so I gave it a shot. Basically at Mercer Advertising, single Kate Mosley (Jennifer Aniston) is trying to build up to a better career at the company, and even when suggesting a great and chosen idea for a campaign, isn't promoted. Then she finds a way to get the promotion she wants, when people see her in a photo with some guy at a wedding party, she never corrects anyone about being engaged to him. Kate's new and better career seems to be going great, and she is spending her money on lots of luxury and convenience, she even manages to bed her crush, Sam Mayfair (Kevin Bacon). But then her boss Mr. Mercer (Kevin Dunn) wants to meet the guy, Nick (Jay Mohr), and he manages to track him down, and pays him to go along with her plan to have dinner and meet everyone, and quickly break up. He is willing to go along with the plan at first, but it is obvious the few days before it happens, he develops real affection for her, and she is forced into making the break-up happen. Obviously they get back together again before he has to go away, but as is predictable, in the end she goes to a wedding he is filming, expresses her (real) feelings for him, and they have their happy ending hug and kiss. Also starring Steel Magnolias' Olympia Dukakis as Rita Mosley, Cape Fear's Illeana Douglas as Darcy O'Neil, Anne Twomey as Sela and Faith Prince as Mrs. Mercer. The story may be predictable mostly, and even on the preposterous side, but Aniston (in her days of Friends' success) is likable, and it is a good-natured romantic comedy. Worth watching!

    A consistent homage to all the 'values' that have brought the credit crunch to the USA and UK. Selfishness and shallowness portrayed as acceptable and lovable characteristics. The underlying theme being that it is fine to lie, cheat, get into debt, deceive your closest friends and it will all work out fine - as long as you really really want whatever it is you are prepared to lie, cheat and deceive about. A career woman, uses a nice person, a stranger she meets at a wedding, shows no interest in him as a human being and despite saying 'I don't want you to feel like a thing' goes on to treat him exactly as a 'thing'. A prop to help her get what she wants. What she wants is to sleep with a serial womaniser, to get promotion and higher pay and that's about it really. Then when she gets them she decides they aren't as shiny as she thought they'd be and wants the 'thing/stranger/wedding guy' to be her permanent plaything instead. She still has no idea about him as a person other than he took the time to get to know her (and for some incomprehensible reason given her behaviour and lack of any redeeming characteristics) and bought her a watch to replace one she lost as a child. Yet based on this tenuous reason she admits the subterfuge to her bosses and risks her job. Given she has already decided the job isn't all that great - it isn't that much of a sacrifice. Then the 'new improved' female gatecrashes a strangers wedding, risks the business of her intended 'plaything' by ensuring he will be remembered as the guy who ruined his clients wedding by being stalked by a nut job. For some reason this selfish, irresponsible act endears the used, abused 'plaything' guy so that he agrees to be 'the one' for her - kiss, kiss, end of film. The main guy character has in effect fallen in love with a selfish, controlling, manipulative, scheming narcissist and signed up to be treated badly until she finds something more shiny to distract her in the future. So given how stupid a lot of people are that bit is probably true to life at least. But touching, funny, heart warming - no it isn't.

    It may be unfair to label Picture Perfect a RomCom. It certainly sits at the less frivolous, more acutely observed end of the spectrum within the genre. There are some small but brilliant moments here, mostly to do with rom rather than com. When Aniston attends the wedding and the bouquet is to be thrown, she steps forward to find herself the only single woman in the room. It is quite poignant, and her retort - "Oh, just hand me the damn thing!" - plays the scene out beautifully. The fight in the restaurant, when it does come, is a masterclass in infusing sub-text into dialogue. Aninston holds it all together with ease, Kevin Bacon is superbly vacuous as the office beefcake, and Jay Mohr does a decent shift, especially when called upon to hint at deeper feelings for career-driven Kate. The ending reverts to by-the-numbers RomCom proceedings, but there is enough in the build-up to have you give up some smiles and tears that you'll feel the film earned.

    An Aniston vehicle, released at the very height of Friends' success on telly. It's a sunny, back-to-front romcom after Green Card, for example, in which Kate (Aniston) uses a guy she meets at a wedding to advance her career. Like most men on the planet, Jay Mohr's Nick can't simply play the attendant fianc&eacute; though and the complications bring things to a head, nicely resolved in one of the least likely, contrived, wedding-themed conclusions I've seen in this kind of flick. Mad. Illeana Douglas and Kevin Douglas are the stalwart, bankable support and Mohr is capably riding the surf of being the chief antagonist of predecessor Jerry Maguire. The film is all about Aniston though. She's a good actress giving the flimsy conceit some body. Speaking of body, she's also sufficiently aware of her own appeal to wear a second-act dress a size too small, as well as no bra in the denouement. Oh and Kevin Bacon's in it too. As I say, mad. 3/10
