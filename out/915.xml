    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up?

The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    I am not an American but I truly learned about American politics from the time Bill Clinton took office. I also learned about the incredible power that television media began to accumulate during the early 90s. This is a film about both. I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

I will not say that I learned much new about politics or the media. It was all brilliantly covered by the real newscasts. Bill Clinton was a major celebrity and also a good politician. This movie is not really about Clinton, though, as others have pointed out. It's about morals and how they are almost always compromised when it comes to politics. This is of course brilliantly captured with the Libby Holden character, played by the incomparable Kathy Bates. I do, however think that the film is too flawed to recommend. It has too much emphasis on the affairs of Jack Stanton, and I know why so much of the running time was spent on that. It's because Clinton/Stanton is or was a basically decent politician with one serious flaw. But in the end this flaw is milked and milked and milked to the point where I thought: "Okay, I get it!". As a consequence, several characters, who I thought deserved more development, were left hanging, like Billy Bob Thornton's and Maura Tierney's. It's a good enough film but it could have been more.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

    Over 20 years before a film like Primary Colors could even be conceived, a young Italian heart-throb was breaking box office records with a film which defined the Disco era: the film was Saturday Night Fever, and the movie star was John Travolta. The year: 1977. Fast-forward 20 years. Disco was over, and the New York suburbanite whose career declined in the 1980's, often labeled a one-trick pony, had a resurgence in the 1990's. Travolta went from movie star to actor, and Primary Colors is no question Travolta's best effort. Rather than playing a New York street-smart and club hustler, Travolta dons the garb of a cheeky Midwestern politician, Jack Stanton, a Midwest governor who rings a helluva lot like Bill Clinton. His auspicious wife, Susan Stanton (played stride-for-stride by the incomparable Emma Thompson) has the intelligence and no nonsense drive which rings a lot like Hillary Clinton. Together, they are on the road to capture the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. Adrian Lester in a superb and entirely convincing performance plays the straight man Henry Burton, a new-comer to the campaign. Throughout the entire film, we see the Stantons through Burton's eyes, which are at first enthralled, smitten, and eventually disillusioned with not only the shortcomings of Jack Stanton but the entire political process. Burton is pulled into the process even before he has committed himself. He accompanies Stanton on all the primary stops, staying in cheap hotels and constantly eating out. At one point he says he's never been involved in a political campaign, to which Susan Stanton replies "Neither have we." He sets up speech venues, and campaign headquarters. He also makes a few blunders along the way, neglecting to be informed about an appearance by one of their opponents. Stanton is so livid, he throws his cell phone out the window. Stanton seems to have all the qualities for making a good presidential candidate. He is highly intelligent yet personable at the one-on-one level. He is an effective debater and speaker. And he has a winning personality that the electorate can admire, even adore. But Stanton has a secret. When given the chance to engage in an extra-marital affair, he can't seem to stop himself. As the campaign progresses, Stanton's sexual history starts to come to the fore. Burton, Richard Lemmons the campaign manager (Billy Bob Thorton), and private investigator Libby Holden (Kathy Bates) must do their best to pick up the pieces and clean up for Stanton. Or at the least, they have to figure out what the press might find and beat them to it, like a wild boar stocking prey as they are characterized. All the leads and supports are par excellence. The unexpected stand-out of the cast is John Travolta who really captured the mannerisms, gestures, and speech of Bill Clinton, a.k.a. Jack Stanton. He really seems a Midwestern WASP rather than an NY Italian. Because the rest of the cast is so strong, the cast keeps up with Travolta line-for-line. High marks go to Adrian Lester as the campaign organizer Henry who loses first his girlfriend, then later his sense of morality when he signs onto the campaign. Emma Thompson can't be beat as Susan Stanton, a.k.a. Hillary Clinton. Billy Bob Thorton's character is essentially James Carvill, the southern democrat who was Clinton's campaign manager, the equivalent of Karl Rove. Unlike many other industrialized countries, the US electorate desires their politicians to have relatively clean records in areas which have nothing to do with politics. Extra-marital affairs are absolutely taboo for US Presidents yet very common among leaders in Europe. (I've heard having a mistress is a prerequisite for the Prime Minister of France.) Stanton is essentially Bill Clinton by another name. Clinton was and is a brilliant politician, but he couldn't keep his pants zipped while campaigning for and occupying national office. But somehow he made it work.

    Primary Colors, which came out in 1998, is a political film unlike any other. It appears to be self aware of the political situation in modern United States politics. It both pokes fun at American politics and sheds light on real unnerving problems. It also poses a battle between political power and human morals. The film, like other films we've viewed this semester, places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is more important. The film came out in 1998. During this time Bill Clinton was president and the Monica Lewinski scandal is just starting to surface in the media. Up until this point Bill Clinton, having been recently re-elected, was for the most part a celebrated president. The United States was enjoying a time of peace. The only real problem the country was facing was a slight recession. However, the sex scandal in the white house shook the American citizens to the core. Suddenly a politician that appeared to be trustworthy was dishonest. The American citizens didn't know whom they could trust in politics. Clinton was impeached but was acquitted. Primary Colors' character Jack Stanton, played by John Travolta, is an obvious interpretation of Bill Clinton. Primary Colors decides to show both sides of the political process during the primary races. It shows that campaigning is just about the people as it is about destroying your competitor. This is done by either hiding your own implicating material or uncovering material that may be implicating to the competitor. This film shows the political primary races as a ruthless and morally absent competition to eliminate contenders. Fairness does not seem to enter in to this competition because the politicians in this film seem to be more preoccupied by sabotaging their competitors campaign rather than create credible political strategies. Jack Stanton's character has quite a bit going against him during his race. He is faced with a false accusation of having an affair with a hairdresser. Also, implications arise in the media that he was a draft dodger and had arrests covered up. Even a protagonist is not 100% honest in this political world that the movie has created. The film decides to make itself "real" by presenting real life political problems. Perhaps this was done to show the audience that the message the film is conveying is in fact a truthful one. The scene where Jack is addressing the factory workers is a good example of this. Stanton states that he cannot fix the factory workers situation because companies will always export jobs to cheaper countries. He takes an honest approach so he can focus on his primary political stance of education. This technique is rarely seen by politicians in real life as some would rather lie to get votes. Primary Colors main battle is between political power and morals. Jack Stanton prides himself on being fair and honest, and this creates a good protagonist. The character conflict arises when he is pulled into a dirty political fight where his character's morality is tested. He decides to fight dirty by digging up implicating material. The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10

    The only thing separating the "fallen" Politician from those who have not is that they got CAUGHT, in something undeniable and the unseating ensues with not much surprise but always some interest. The hypocrisy is rampant and if you cracked open any of them you are likely to find something revealing, some kind of Human fault or weakness or Sin. Corruption, immorality, and illegality are prevalent if not rampant in the ranks of the elected "public servants". From Bill Clinton to Strom Thurmond we see glimpses if not revelations of such behavior. This slightly satirical look inside is quite a droll and tame affair. It is engaging enough if not fully functional and satisfying. It is all handled by professional Movie Makers and is slick, but not sultry in its portrayal of behind the bedroom door exposures of front runners and back stabbers. There is not one sex scene in this Film about sexual responsibility and consequences and it is better for it. It makes its other points, quite well, on how to deal with the implications of being outed, both by the Party and Candidates involved and their opponents. The Movie is insightful but not really intense or deep and is more of an entertainment than Political Science.

    I just saw this movie for the first time. I enjoyed it. It was probably historically correct to a high degree, but the names were changed to protect the guilty. In one scene a man bursts into a meeting and yells "Quick. Turn on CNN." CNN was announcing the heart attack of the running opponent, Harris. This man who rushed in looked like John Cazales (perhaps better known as Fredo Corleone). However, Cazales' name is not in the credits. I carefully scanned the credits at the end of the film, reviewed the credits in this database, and even looked up what films Cazales had made. There were only 7, and this is not one of them. So, if this man is not him, then who is he?

    This Film &agrave; clef is clearly thinly disguised as a stand in for Bill Clinton's 1992 presidential primary election campaign. Not even the book written by an anonymous author can hide the facts that it's closely mirrors Bill Clinton's attempt to win over the people dismight conflicts such as his affairs, his participation in Vietnam War era protest, and others. Every thing about the film, just about speaks of him, even the actor playing an Southern governor Jack Stanton (John Travolta) who mimics the president southern drawn, and charm. It's hard not to see him in Jack. The movie starts with an idealistic former congressional worker, Henry Burton AKA George Stephanopoulos (Adrian Lester), whom joins the campaign whoms been impressed by Stanton's genuine warmth and empathy with people. He joins Stanton's inner circle of political advisers: Stanton's formidable wife, Susan Stanton AKA Hillary Clinton (Emma Thompson). Emme Thompson plays the shrewdness role well, as a women whom dreams and hope are riding on a man whom does mistake after mistake, nearly derailing his chances to be president. She doesn't mind chewing him out or bailing him. She always doesn't mind the womanizing that takes it's toll on her, as long as she wins in the end. Henry also meets ruthless, redneck political strategist Richard Jemmons AKA James Carville (Billy Bob Thornton) whom character is so unlikeable, it's hurt the film. The character is too mopey, drunk, sexual harasser and indecisive that it doesn't match the entertaining Carville of the documentary "The War Room,". It's not Carville. It's a downer character nobody ask for. Lastly he meets tough, but unbalanced Libby Holden AKA Betsey Wright/ Vince Foster (Kathy Bates.) Kathy Bates gives one of her best performance in this role, as she able to show strong emotion when needed, while also breaking down heart-broken. The film get good when tackles Henry and Libby are forced to seek out information about a rival politician. It's really shows how deep, far and twisted, people will go to dig to make sure their candidate wins while also showing how deeply disillusioned, they can be with the whole political process. Thus is each character tested: Do we do the right thing for the wrong reason, the wrong thing for the right reason? How low do we go? If we go too low, can we ever get back up? Both of them are forced to choose between idealism and realism when looking up and helping out a political contender. Kathy Bates' Libby Holden is the movie's most outstanding character and the one who most stirringly articulates its frustrations about the candidate. The film's single best and most serious scene, arriving in its abruptly melodramatic third act, finds Libby desperately begging the Stantons to assess their campaign ethics. It's heart breaking speech is brilliant. The satire film does a good job following the book's plot. I think Joe Klein would be proud. Oops-- I meant the anonymous author. Much of the charm of the Mike Nichols film is just looking at the array of vivid caricatures actor playing real-life people, but it's lacks to give us a great main character. Henry is a bland, passive presence occupying a good deal of screen time. Adrian Lester is great, but it's doesn't have that George Stephanopoulos charm to him. The boy scout works for a while, he knows Stanton is somewhat a phony since the beginning, but it's doesn't seem to matter to him. So why does the political process makes him disillusioned, if he knew all the long that this might be stressful? He knew what he was putting himself in. I guess he didn't know how much he was willing to take. It suppose to be by the end time, he comes a time when he must make peace with the idea that the purest of causes may be advanced by the most impure of champions, but he knew that before getting in. This is what hurts the film. It's not like Mr. Smith goes to Washington here, he knew in advance, how ugly it is. Does he change it for the better? No. Does he keep his moral ground? No. Henry doesn't learn anything new, but he does get a new job. The movie is slow-pace, funny at times, but hard to watch, cause how depressing it is. It exposes politics for what it is. A ugly, disgusting, game where idealism is crush, disappointment kicks in, and when you come out of it. You feel like you tired of it. That's what happen to the film. It gets tiresome after one watch. It's like the elections. Good for one night every four years.

    The movie is well made and the acting is very good, but I still don't understand why getting Governor Stanton elected is so important? He seems to be a lovable philanderer with absolutely no personal morals. He seems to really care about people in the macro sense but not in the micro sense. If he did he would not act so callous to his friends and wife and lovers. Why was getting Governor Stanton elected so important? It seems like this film was made for people who believed that getting a Democrat elected, even one who had grave personal failings was more important than getting a Republican elected. That is where I feel the movie was weak. In 50 years moviegoers are going to be asking themselves this question who were not alive in the 20th century to understand how hated Republicans where in the 90s. Great political movies like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington establish the need to get Jimmy Stewart elected. This movie does not establish the need to get John Travolta elected.

The moral representative in the film then shifts to the Libby Holden character. She believes, as Jack used to, that campaigning should just be about political stances rather than hurting competitors. Jack decides to use reason by saying if he doesn't use the implicating material then someone else will. This places the viewer in a dilemma where they must decide what is right to themselves. In a way the Henry character is an outlet that the audience can side with. In the end Jack Stanton decides to take the middle route by alerting the competitor of the material and not going to the media. The film shows that politicians are not perfect people; in fact they are from it. Most of them have made mistakes; some are just more honest than others. Perhaps it is just better to focus on their political stances and agendas rather than focus on their past mistakes.

    Some great group dynamics, and solid, if predictable.

    Primary Colors (1998) This starts off really great, and gets the flavor of a real campaign, without too much Hollywood hype (campaigns have their own kind of falseness, which is played up here). John Travolta not only hits it just right as a feeling and determined candidate, he also nails Bill Clinton pretty well, too. I don't suppose Emma Thompson is supposed to match Hillary quite as well, but she's a perfect running mate, and throw in Billy Bob (Thornton) as a sidekick and you have a really solid working trio. But it doesn't quite keep the focus or momentum, or honesty, of the opening scenes. Or humor, sometimes. (This is a comedy, by the way, and director Mike Nichols knows comedy, as does his screenwriter and longtime collaborator, Elaine May. They used to do stand up comedy together in the 1950s!) What begins as a kind of revelation and interior exploration digresses into more and more clich&eacute;s of what campaigns do, and what they have to do (sleaze wise) to succeed. We know this stuff. It isn't the facts that enchant us, it's the exceptions to the facts, and it's the nuances between them. It never quite flags, though twenty minutes less screen time sounded good by the end. And Travolta and Thompson hold up their roles consistently. The real saving grace in the second half is the bursting on the scene of Kathy Bates, who is herself at her best. It might be the best Kathy Bates Kathy Bates has ever done, including some impassioned, tearful stuff. The opposing candidate is remarkably convincing--you even want to vote for him--played by Larry Hagman. On the other hand, the young clerk and campaign manager Adrian Lester is a bit too restrained and dull to make him even noticeable. Nichols is best when he gets two or three or four people interacting as real people, with flaws and intensity and passion (as in "The Graduate" and "Closer"). And those moments here are terrific, and sometimes hilarious, and make the rest easily worthwhile.

    What on paper sounds like the ingredients of a smart, snappy political satire instead makes for an over-long and lifeless dud of a movie. Mike Nichols directs John Travolta and Emma Thompson as a political couple clearly modeled on Bill and Hillary Clinton as they make their bid for President and First Lady of the U.S. But the movie has no spark at all, and it drifts aimlessly and lethargically to its conclusion. The only person who is able to breathe some life into the proceedings is Kathy Bates as a firecracker of a political consultant. Once she departs the film, her presence is sorely missed. Grade: C-

    I saw about 75 minutes of it, and that was quite enough for me.

    Primary Colors is yet another political drama, that pretty much bored me to tears. For starters, while I am a big John Travolta fan, he is completely miscast in the title role. As other reviewers have noted, John tries so hard to be like Bill Clinton, that it completely falls flat, in my opinion. They even go as far as to mimic, the whole Gennifer Flowers and Bill Clinton thing, there own way. It just tried so hard to reflect back on the Clinton Era, it almost became laughable. The characters in this movie themselves, are pretty unlikable. I had a lot of trouble rooting for Jack Stanton's character ,he seamed awfully weasel like, from what I saw. Fans of the whole Clinton era, and politics in general, may get a kick out of this film, but it honestly wasn't for me. Performances. John Travola tries hard ,sometimes too hard. It's just he ends up making an impression more then anything else ,and his charisma can only take him so far. He is heavily miscast, even though the Director, Mike Nichols, tries so hard, to make him look and act like Clinton. Emma Thompson is OK as the wife. She has no real chemistry with Travolta, and they didn't feel that real to me. Billy Bob Thornton is not bad in his role, but he didn't make that much of an impression. Kathy Bates adds class to any film she's in, unfortunately the script Doesen't give her much to work with. Adrian Lester does pretty decently with what he has to do ,I enjoyed a few of his scenes with Travolta. Maura Tierney is cute and charismatic as Daisy, I rather liked her. Bottom Line. Primary Colors, is pretty much a big bore. I shut it off after 75 minutes ,because it failed to engage me. Politics are just not my thing. Maybe one of these days ,I'll find a movie about politics, that does interest me. 4/10
