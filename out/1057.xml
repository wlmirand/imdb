 <sinopse>
  A young man's life is thrown into a loop when he is asked to be a pallbearer for the funeral of a classmate he doesn't remember, and his old high school crush temporarily returns to town.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Chaos unfolds as Tom is roped into being a pallbearer (and delivering the eulogy!) by the mother of a recently deceased "friend" from high school that he just can't remember. In the meantime, an unrequited love from high school (NOT the dead guy's girlfriend) reappears in his life.

    I know it has been said already, but a 4.8 rating is criminally low for this movie. I'm guessing, based on my own pre-viewing experience, that the low rating is due to viewer expectations. After reading the cover of the VHS copy I watched, I expected Pallbearers to be a lighthearted, screwball comedy. Although there were comic moments, the movie also explored deeper terrain, and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty, turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic, charming, endearing, and overall fantastic in the lead role (shades of Woody Allen) and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored; nevertheless, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of "The Graduate", or even the hit television series "Friends", in which the leading man, had a prominent role. After watching the movie, we are going to make the point of reading the book, because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen, as conceived by its creator. What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer, we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across, but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

    I watched this film for the 1st time last night and immediately thought, "how did I miss this one". The obscurity of the film was even mirrored by the fact that it doesn't even show in my timeout encyclopedia. Not being a huge "Friends" fan I used to be a little sceptical of Schwimmers talents but after seeing this film I must say that he's growing on me. This is the type of film that I love to see Americans making. It reminded me of "Sideways" and "Nobody's fool". Great lines executed by a good cast. Hershey is very sexy and I wanted Tom to choose her over Paltrow, I know I would of. I laughed a fair few times and would probably watch this again in a couple of years time on a rainy Yorkshire afternoon.

    Heartfelt as much as it is real, this movie reminds me of "the graduate". David Schwimmer does an admirable job, although I cannot say the same about Gwyneth Paltrow. (since I've watched this movie almost five years ago and I don't even remember her role ). Memorable performance with some of the cast, especially Carol Kane's role as "Tom's mother", brings forth such grace and texture to a role whose character requires no less complexity (which makes Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate" look almost two-dimensional). It remains a mystery to me why this movie was rated so lowly on IMDb, and in general. Still gold has to shine and I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not hate the "Ross (as in Friends)personality, and is tired of comedies that try too hard.

    This has always been one of my favorites from the mid-1990s time period. I think when the film was marketed, it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic, with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bona-fide star. The performances ring true, and sure, there are problems, but Barbara Hershey once again proves that she's one of the most under-rated actresses of her generation. It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson. They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a "Friends" audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

    Pallbearer is a story about a guy who has not gained anything in his life and his future does not look promising either. Well, he is healthy and sane but incredibly unfortunate because he has probably been a too kind person: the life he was supposed to be living has slipped through his fingers. Turning now into latter part of his twenties he realizes that he's still a little boy and he should start doing something. He will have a hopeless crush on a girl, and likewise a widow who has lost his son too will have a hopeless crush on him and that leads into a romance that is both tragic and comical. David Schwimmer makes a good performance as the guy who has to survive from many kinds of embarrassing situations, and Paltrow as the woman will do the standard Paltrow set. Nothing too surprising in the plot but the film is relatively good watching because of some well worked little scenes that faintly resemble Mr. Bean episodes.

    This 1996 flick was directed and co-written by Matt Reeves along with Jason Katims. A sort of serious romantic comedy. I loved Barbara Hershey in this. She never disappoints. Playing the mother of a son she lost, she turns to companionship to help heal the loss. David Schwimmer, Ross in FRIENDS, helps her out. Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man, almost a virgin in relationships. Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So, the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady, Carol Kane, his mother, who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie. Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie. Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

    I feel fairly certain that had i watched this movie on video or in the theater it certainly would have been better. Unfortunately i saw it on cable with commercials defiling all the tension built up by a dramatic scene. ***** spoiler ****** They almost lost me at the funeral scene. I simply could not get past the laugher of Tom's friends (aren't they in their 20's and NOT in their teens? ). I didn't find the scene funny but rather pathetic. Besides was Tom such a moron as to not be able to come up with any traditional things to say to the bereaved ? Perhaps its me, but I'm certain i could give a eulogy for anyone's funeral without problem while winging it the whole way.. Just think of positive adjectives (kind, caring, sweet, generous, thoughtful, smart, funny, witty, ...etc) then apply them to the deceased. And just take a pause to think between each set of compliments. Besides if he knew he was going to have do to this why not at least try to think of something ! The writers really dropped the ball on this one. Or they did a really good job of not being funny. Fortunately Paltrow's pretty face kept me around to see more of the film. Overall i think some of the drama of the film made it worth watching. Ironically, it was billed as a romantic comedy because I'm pretty sure i didn't laugh even once. 6.5 stars out of 10

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of "The Graduate", or even the hit television series "Friends", in which the leading man, had a prominent role.

The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

It remains a mystery to me why this movie was rated so lowly on IMDb, and in general. Still gold has to shine and I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not hate the "Ross (as in Friends)personality, and is tired of comedies that try too hard.

    This has always been one of my favorites from the mid-1990s time period. I think when the film was marketed, it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic, with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bona-fide star. The performances ring true, and sure, there are problems, but Barbara Hershey once again proves that she's one of the most under-rated actresses of her generation. It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson. They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a "Friends" audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

    Pallbearer is a story about a guy who has not gained anything in his life and his future does not look promising either. Well, he is healthy and sane but incredibly unfortunate because he has probably been a too kind person: the life he was supposed to be living has slipped through his fingers. Turning now into latter part of his twenties he realizes that he's still a little boy and he should start doing something. He will have a hopeless crush on a girl, and likewise a widow who has lost his son too will have a hopeless crush on him and that leads into a romance that is both tragic and comical. David Schwimmer makes a good performance as the guy who has to survive from many kinds of embarrassing situations, and Paltrow as the woman will do the standard Paltrow set. Nothing too surprising in the plot but the film is relatively good watching because of some well worked little scenes that faintly resemble Mr. Bean episodes.

    This 1996 flick was directed and co-written by Matt Reeves along with Jason Katims. A sort of serious romantic comedy. I loved Barbara Hershey in this. She never disappoints. Playing the mother of a son she lost, she turns to companionship to help heal the loss. David Schwimmer, Ross in FRIENDS, helps her out. Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man, almost a virgin in relationships. Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So, the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady, Carol Kane, his mother, who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie. Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie. Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

    I feel fairly certain that had i watched this movie on video or in the theater it certainly would have been better. Unfortunately i saw it on cable with commercials defiling all the tension built up by a dramatic scene. ***** spoiler ****** They almost lost me at the funeral scene. I simply could not get past the laugher of Tom's friends (aren't they in their 20's and NOT in their teens? ). I didn't find the scene funny but rather pathetic. Besides was Tom such a moron as to not be able to come up with any traditional things to say to the bereaved ? Perhaps its me, but I'm certain i could give a eulogy for anyone's funeral without problem while winging it the whole way.. Just think of positive adjectives (kind, caring, sweet, generous, thoughtful, smart, funny, witty, ...etc) then apply them to the deceased. And just take a pause to think between each set of compliments. Besides if he knew he was going to have do to this why not at least try to think of something ! The writers really dropped the ball on this one. Or they did a really good job of not being funny. Fortunately Paltrow's pretty face kept me around to see more of the film. Overall i think some of the drama of the film made it worth watching. Ironically, it was billed as a romantic comedy because I'm pretty sure i didn't laugh even once. 6.5 stars out of 10

    I know it has been said already, but a 4.8 rating is criminally low for this movie. I'm guessing, based on my own pre-viewing experience, that the low rating is due to viewer expectations. After reading the cover of the VHS copy I watched, I expected Pallbearers to be a lighthearted, screwball comedy. Although there were comic moments, the movie also explored deeper terrain, and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty, turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic, charming, endearing, and overall fantastic in the lead role (shades of Woody Allen) and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored; nevertheless, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of "The Graduate", or even the hit television series "Friends", in which the leading man, had a prominent role. After watching the movie, we are going to make the point of reading the book, because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen, as conceived by its creator. What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer, we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across, but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

    I watched this film for the 1st time last night and immediately thought, "how did I miss this one". The obscurity of the film was even mirrored by the fact that it doesn't even show in my timeout encyclopedia. Not being a huge "Friends" fan I used to be a little sceptical of Schwimmers talents but after seeing this film I must say that he's growing on me. This is the type of film that I love to see Americans making. It reminded me of "Sideways" and "Nobody's fool". Great lines executed by a good cast. Hershey is very sexy and I wanted Tom to choose her over Paltrow, I know I would of. I laughed a fair few times and would probably watch this again in a couple of years time on a rainy Yorkshire afternoon.

    Heartfelt as much as it is real, this movie reminds me of "the graduate". David Schwimmer does an admirable job, although I cannot say the same about Gwyneth Paltrow. (since I've watched this movie almost five years ago and I don't even remember her role ). Memorable performance with some of the cast, especially Carol Kane's role as "Tom's mother", brings forth such grace and texture to a role whose character requires no less complexity (which makes Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate" look almost two-dimensional). It remains a mystery to me why this movie was rated so lowly on IMDb, and in general. Still gold has to shine and I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not hate the "Ross (as in Friends)personality, and is tired of comedies that try too hard.

I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

    Pallbearer is a story about a guy who has not gained anything in his life and his future does not look promising either. Well, he is healthy and sane but incredibly unfortunate because he has probably been a too kind person: the life he was supposed to be living has slipped through his fingers. Turning now into latter part of his twenties he realizes that he's still a little boy and he should start doing something. He will have a hopeless crush on a girl, and likewise a widow who has lost his son too will have a hopeless crush on him and that leads into a romance that is both tragic and comical. David Schwimmer makes a good performance as the guy who has to survive from many kinds of embarrassing situations, and Paltrow as the woman will do the standard Paltrow set. Nothing too surprising in the plot but the film is relatively good watching because of some well worked little scenes that faintly resemble Mr. Bean episodes.

Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie. Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

I simply could not get past the laugher of Tom's friends (aren't they in their 20's and NOT in their teens? ). I didn't find the scene funny but rather pathetic. Besides was Tom such a moron as to not be able to come up with any traditional things to say to the bereaved ? Perhaps its me, but I'm certain i could give a eulogy for anyone's funeral without problem while winging it the whole way.. Just think of positive adjectives (kind, caring, sweet, generous, thoughtful, smart, funny, witty, ...etc) then apply them to the deceased. And just take a pause to think between each set of compliments. Besides if he knew he was going to have do to this why not at least try to think of something ! The writers really dropped the ball on this one. Or they did a really good job of not being funny. Fortunately Paltrow's pretty face kept me around to see more of the film. Overall i think some of the drama of the film made it worth watching. Ironically, it was billed as a romantic comedy because I'm pretty sure i didn't laugh even once. 6.5 stars out of 10

I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored; nevertheless, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of "The Graduate", or even the hit television series "Friends", in which the leading man, had a prominent role. After watching the movie, we are going to make the point of reading the book, because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen, as conceived by its creator. What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer, we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across, but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

    I watched this film for the 1st time last night and immediately thought, "how did I miss this one". The obscurity of the film was even mirrored by the fact that it doesn't even show in my timeout encyclopedia. Not being a huge "Friends" fan I used to be a little sceptical of Schwimmers talents but after seeing this film I must say that he's growing on me. This is the type of film that I love to see Americans making. It reminded me of "Sideways" and "Nobody's fool". Great lines executed by a good cast. Hershey is very sexy and I wanted Tom to choose her over Paltrow, I know I would of. I laughed a fair few times and would probably watch this again in a couple of years time on a rainy Yorkshire afternoon.

    Heartfelt as much as it is real, this movie reminds me of "the graduate". David Schwimmer does an admirable job, although I cannot say the same about Gwyneth Paltrow. (since I've watched this movie almost five years ago and I don't even remember her role ). Memorable performance with some of the cast, especially Carol Kane's role as "Tom's mother", brings forth such grace and texture to a role whose character requires no less complexity (which makes Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate" look almost two-dimensional). It remains a mystery to me why this movie was rated so lowly on IMDb, and in general. Still gold has to shine and I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not hate the "Ross (as in Friends)personality, and is tired of comedies that try too hard.

    This has always been one of my favorites from the mid-1990s time period. I think when the film was marketed, it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic, with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bona-fide star. The performances ring true, and sure, there are problems, but Barbara Hershey once again proves that she's one of the most under-rated actresses of her generation. It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson. They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a "Friends" audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

    Pallbearer is a story about a guy who has not gained anything in his life and his future does not look promising either. Well, he is healthy and sane but incredibly unfortunate because he has probably been a too kind person: the life he was supposed to be living has slipped through his fingers. Turning now into latter part of his twenties he realizes that he's still a little boy and he should start doing something. He will have a hopeless crush on a girl, and likewise a widow who has lost his son too will have a hopeless crush on him and that leads into a romance that is both tragic and comical. David Schwimmer makes a good performance as the guy who has to survive from many kinds of embarrassing situations, and Paltrow as the woman will do the standard Paltrow set. Nothing too surprising in the plot but the film is relatively good watching because of some well worked little scenes that faintly resemble Mr. Bean episodes.

    This 1996 flick was directed and co-written by Matt Reeves along with Jason Katims. A sort of serious romantic comedy. I loved Barbara Hershey in this. She never disappoints. Playing the mother of a son she lost, she turns to companionship to help heal the loss. David Schwimmer, Ross in FRIENDS, helps her out. Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man, almost a virgin in relationships. Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So, the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady, Carol Kane, his mother, who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie. Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie. Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

    I feel fairly certain that had i watched this movie on video or in the theater it certainly would have been better. Unfortunately i saw it on cable with commercials defiling all the tension built up by a dramatic scene. ***** spoiler ****** They almost lost me at the funeral scene. I simply could not get past the laugher of Tom's friends (aren't they in their 20's and NOT in their teens? ). I didn't find the scene funny but rather pathetic. Besides was Tom such a moron as to not be able to come up with any traditional things to say to the bereaved ? Perhaps its me, but I'm certain i could give a eulogy for anyone's funeral without problem while winging it the whole way.. Just think of positive adjectives (kind, caring, sweet, generous, thoughtful, smart, funny, witty, ...etc) then apply them to the deceased. And just take a pause to think between each set of compliments. Besides if he knew he was going to have do to this why not at least try to think of something ! The writers really dropped the ball on this one. Or they did a really good job of not being funny. Fortunately Paltrow's pretty face kept me around to see more of the film. Overall i think some of the drama of the film made it worth watching. Ironically, it was billed as a romantic comedy because I'm pretty sure i didn't laugh even once. 6.5 stars out of 10

    I know it has been said already, but a 4.8 rating is criminally low for this movie. I'm guessing, based on my own pre-viewing experience, that the low rating is due to viewer expectations. After reading the cover of the VHS copy I watched, I expected Pallbearers to be a lighthearted, screwball comedy. Although there were comic moments, the movie also explored deeper terrain, and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty, turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic, charming, endearing, and overall fantastic in the lead role (shades of Woody Allen) and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored; nevertheless, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims.

The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

I think when the film was marketed, it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic, with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bona-fide star.

It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson. They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a "Friends" audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.

    Pallbearer is a story about a guy who has not gained anything in his life and his future does not look promising either. Well, he is healthy and sane but incredibly unfortunate because he has probably been a too kind person: the life he was supposed to be living has slipped through his fingers. Turning now into latter part of his twenties he realizes that he's still a little boy and he should start doing something. He will have a hopeless crush on a girl, and likewise a widow who has lost his son too will have a hopeless crush on him and that leads into a romance that is both tragic and comical. David Schwimmer makes a good performance as the guy who has to survive from many kinds of embarrassing situations, and Paltrow as the woman will do the standard Paltrow set. Nothing too surprising in the plot but the film is relatively good watching because of some well worked little scenes that faintly resemble Mr. Bean episodes.

    This 1996 flick was directed and co-written by Matt Reeves along with Jason Katims. A sort of serious romantic comedy. I loved Barbara Hershey in this. She never disappoints. Playing the mother of a son she lost, she turns to companionship to help heal the loss. David Schwimmer, Ross in FRIENDS, helps her out. Schwimmer does an admirable job as a young man, almost a virgin in relationships. Then he meets the likes of Gwyneth Paltrow and sparks begin to fly. So, the plot thickens when he's up against the two ladies in his life. Add another lady, Carol Kane, his mother, who does a brilliant job as she fawns over her son. She's a riot and brings what little comedy there is to the movie. Friends to Schwimmer are played by Michael Rapaport as a groom to be, with advice for his friend, and Michael Vartan, who I have liked since THE NEXT BEST THING. They both add much to this movie. Not really a comedy, as the acting is quite real and often touching, but enjoyable to watch the two stars in the leads and an excellent supporting cast.

    I feel fairly certain that had i watched this movie on video or in the theater it certainly would have been better. Unfortunately i saw it on cable with commercials defiling all the tension built up by a dramatic scene. ***** spoiler ****** They almost lost me at the funeral scene. I simply could not get past the laugher of Tom's friends (aren't they in their 20's and NOT in their teens? ). I didn't find the scene funny but rather pathetic. Besides was Tom such a moron as to not be able to come up with any traditional things to say to the bereaved ? Perhaps its me, but I'm certain i could give a eulogy for anyone's funeral without problem while winging it the whole way.. Just think of positive adjectives (kind, caring, sweet, generous, thoughtful, smart, funny, witty, ...etc) then apply them to the deceased. And just take a pause to think between each set of compliments. Besides if he knew he was going to have do to this why not at least try to think of something ! The writers really dropped the ball on this one. Or they did a really good job of not being funny. Fortunately Paltrow's pretty face kept me around to see more of the film. Overall i think some of the drama of the film made it worth watching. Ironically, it was billed as a romantic comedy because I'm pretty sure i didn't laugh even once. 6.5 stars out of 10

    I know it has been said already, but a 4.8 rating is criminally low for this movie. I'm guessing, based on my own pre-viewing experience, that the low rating is due to viewer expectations. After reading the cover of the VHS copy I watched, I expected Pallbearers to be a lighthearted, screwball comedy. Although there were comic moments, the movie also explored deeper terrain, and was all the better for it. I thought Pallbearers presented a seamless blend of humor and some poignant stuff about the angsty, turbulent ethos of the early 20's. David Schimmer was neurotic, charming, endearing, and overall fantastic in the lead role (shades of Woody Allen) and the supporting actors were all convincing in theirs. I also thought that the soundtrack fit the movie perfectly, providing the perfect backdrop for tones that were simultaneously wistful, bittersweet, romantic, and humorous. Maybe the movie appealed to me especially because I really connected with some of the experiences and emotions explored; nevertheless, I give it a solid 8 out of 10.

    No One really needs another review of this but i'll try. The Pallbearer sustains a beautifully melancholic tone throughout its running time. Those of you who've sat through countless indie films will realize how incredibly hard this is to do in practice. You push this tone too much, you run the risk of looking overly self indulgent or pompous...The Pallbearer doesn't look either of these---it manages to effectively convey the main character's sad existence, the lack of dreams he has for himself, as well as the realization that he's going to need some if he ever wants to get out of his mom's house in Brooklyn. That it manages to set this up while pursuing an unrequited love plot line----schwimmer meets up with his long term high school crush at a social function and resumes pining for her (and yes this was Gwenyth Paltrow's first major role at the time i believe)--while slowly realizing that he could actually date her if he wanted to--which he then attempts to and slowly but surely fumbles away. Its his fumbling that actually makes this plot line work--because his character has such lack of confidence in his abilities to do anything successfully you can almost see how he's just completely sabotaging this relationship up almost as a default setting. The plot borrows a strong ingredient from The Graduate--In short order Schwimmer's character ends up bedding a much older woman---and a much more dominant one as well--but i think his relationship with her comes from a different place then Dustin Hoffman's reasons for bedding Mrs. Robinson in The Graduate. Schwimmer's character feels like a loser, so he acts like a loser, so he continues to live like a loser--perpetuating the cycle--its not exactly an act of rebellion or an act of concern about his future the way it was for Hoffman---but still its a key plot point of The Graduate and the two films similarities in plot and tone are hard to overlook---and yet The Pallbearer got to me in a way that The Graduate never did. Maybe its because The Pallbearer is more contemporary (although not too contemporary--if it was done today--schwimmer's character would spend all of his time on message boards on the internet for sure.) but i definitely felt this film strike a nerve deep within me far more painfully then The Graduate did. This film also was the first one produced by none other then JJ Abrams--2 years before Felicity made its debut on TV--and a full 8 years before LOST premiered. It was also written by frequent TV writer Jason Katims (he of Friday Night Lights, Boston Public, Roswell, and various other rather uncommonly well written television shows concerning modern wayward youth) and directed by Matt Reeves who went on to direct Cloverfield and Let Me In (which is odd because the only horror this film has is completely in the abstract societal sense.) Either way--there was a lot of major talent involved behind the making of this film that was just starting out here for the first time--and i truly believe it to be a far more noteworthy film not only because of that but also because this movie was completely ahead of its time in showing you the whole twenty somethings who don't know what to do with their life stage of life---and also a truly underrated film on its own merits worthy of study and a true successor to The Graduate (and the fact that it'll prob never be seen as such largely sucks.)

    Tom Thompson, a nerdy Brooklyn man, is 25 when we meet him. He still lives at home with his overbearing mother, occupying the same room he lived when he was a teen ager. Tom's placid existence comes to an abrupt stop when he receives a phone call from a Mrs. Abernathy, who proceeds to tell him about the death of her son Bill, who supposedly had been a school mate of Tom's, but as much as he tries to remember the departed classmate, he can't seem to remember. She invites him to be a pallbearer at the funeral. At the same time, Tom, who doesn't seem to have social graces at all, meets a young woman, Julie DeMarco, from his past. He always liked her, but being shy, never told her about the way he felt about her. All this happens at the time when Tom is trying to enlist his friends, Brad and Scott, to accompany him to the funeral. Little prepare Tom for the embarrassment he undergoes while delivering the eulogy. After all, he doesn't even remember the dead man! To make matters worse, Julie, who knew the late Bill Abernathy, is appalled at the spectacle she sees. "The Pallbearer", based on David Lipsky's novel, which we never read, was adapted for the screen by Matt Reeves, who also directs, and Jason Katims. The film evokes other films, specially certain aspects of "The Graduate", or even the hit television series "Friends", in which the leading man, had a prominent role. After watching the movie, we are going to make the point of reading the book, because it appears this work didn't quite translate to the screen, as conceived by its creator. What the film has going for itself is the interesting cast assembled for it. Never having been a fan of David Schwimmer, we have to admit he does a decent job because he is playing against type. Gwyneth Paltrow's take on Julie doesn't quite come across, but she always gives good readings in anything she appears. The surprise was Barbara Hershey, who as Mrs. Abernathy brings substance to a role that could have been a caricature with another, less experienced actress. The excellent supporting role is about the best thing in the movie. Michael Rappaport, a versatile actor, gives a fine performance as Tom's best friend. The amazing Carol Kane is never seen too long, but has a couple of funny scenes as Tom's mother. Tony Collette, as a brunette doesn't get to do much; also in minor roles, Michael Vartan, Mark Margolies, Elizabeth Franz and the rest, contribute to the film.

    I watched this film for the 1st time last night and immediately thought, "how did I miss this one". The obscurity of the film was even mirrored by the fact that it doesn't even show in my timeout encyclopedia. Not being a huge "Friends" fan I used to be a little sceptical of Schwimmers talents but after seeing this film I must say that he's growing on me. This is the type of film that I love to see Americans making. It reminded me of "Sideways" and "Nobody's fool". Great lines executed by a good cast. Hershey is very sexy and I wanted Tom to choose her over Paltrow, I know I would of. I laughed a fair few times and would probably watch this again in a couple of years time on a rainy Yorkshire afternoon.

    Heartfelt as much as it is real, this movie reminds me of "the graduate". David Schwimmer does an admirable job, although I cannot say the same about Gwyneth Paltrow. (since I've watched this movie almost five years ago and I don't even remember her role ). Memorable performance with some of the cast, especially Carol Kane's role as "Tom's mother", brings forth such grace and texture to a role whose character requires no less complexity (which makes Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate" look almost two-dimensional). It remains a mystery to me why this movie was rated so lowly on IMDb, and in general. Still gold has to shine and I would strongly recommend this movie to anyone who does not hate the "Ross (as in Friends)personality, and is tired of comedies that try too hard.

    This has always been one of my favorites from the mid-1990s time period. I think when the film was marketed, it was playing on the growing popularity of Ross from Friends as opposed to David Schwimmer in what is ultimately a glorified indie flic, with a Gwyneth Paltrow that reminds you of why she is a bona-fide star. The performances ring true, and sure, there are problems, but Barbara Hershey once again proves that she's one of the most under-rated actresses of her generation. It's incredibly obvious throughout the film that the photography was guided by the masterful Robert Elswit, showing early signs of the brilliance that has made him an Oscar winner, and the additional eyes of Paul Thomas Anderson. They incredibly mis-marketed this film, and thus there was a "Friends" audience running to the theatre to see something that was far too dark for liking. I stick The Pallbearer into my category of films that includes both Beautiful Girls and The Myth of Fingerprints. I wouldn't say it's superior to these examples of character driven, "it's time to make some life decisions" comedies, but it's certainly worth watching and enjoying.

    'The Pallbearer' is a somewhat inoffensive film which most people could either take or leave. The film was Schwimmer's first attempt at non-'Friends' success but it bombed terribly at the box office and as a result remains unusual and unique in that so far it is his only attempt to carry a picture. I'm hesitant to call a it a star vehicle because it also features Gwenyth Paltrow but that is essentially what it is, or at least tries/was meant to be. I actually like this movie but I would have found it ultimately forgettable if it hadn't been constantly shown on one of the more obscure digital TV channels late at night just as I was coming in from work for a 6 month period a few years back. It has a good and recognisable cast which will put an audience at ease. Rappaport is as usual very funny and Schwimmer plays a very 'Ross'-esque character, given a ridiculous hair cut so that we can obviously differentiate from his 'Friends' persona. Paltrow looks cute and does what she does best.....pouts a lot. The plot itself centres around Schwimmer's character attempting to negotiate a relationship beyond friendship with his high school crush (Paltrow) who he has not been in contact with for years, presumably as he has only recently returned from completing his college studies. This is somewhat hindered though as he has also become intimately involved with the grieving mother of a recently deceased local man played by Barabra Hershey who believes, wrongly, that Schwimmer's character was her departed son's best , and for that matter only, friend at high school. As he is looking for some excitement in life Scwimmer's character was more than willing to maintain this incorrect assumption in order to bed the vulnerable Hershey character but after peddling the deception to the point where he delivers the eulogy at her son's funeral (at which he is also a Pallbearer hence the film's title) guilt begins to catch up with him and the 'Graduate'-esqu style of excitement he had previously felt is replaced by regret. There is also the underlying feeling to which many can probably relate of a post graduate who is struggling to move on with his life. This of course summons further comparisons with the earlier mentioned 'Graduate' from which this picture obviously draws major though not overly obvious influences.Tom Thompson (Schwimmer) has achieved an architectural degree but is struggling to find employment in the field and is back living in his old bedroom at his mother's house which looks , and where he is treated, like he is still at high school. To make matters worse his friends who live near by are all in 9-5 jobs and have all moved on with their lives to the point they are either married or engaged and are considering starting families. The relationship with Hershey seems to give a feeling of maturity whilst the reemergence of Paltrow has allowed him to recall happier and simpler times in his life where he wasn't under so much pressure to grow up. The story itself can be viewed as simplistic and not very exciting but it was matched by the slow pace. I myself actually appreciated it but maybe thats because I found relevance to my own life. Either way the audience can get some enjoyment out of the actor's performances and some sharp dialogue and set pieces. There are also some nice directorial touches though the film is not what you would call stylistic or a talky for that matter. Shwimmer's dead-pan comedic tone and facial expressions worked as well here as they do in 'Friends'. I felt he was just right for the role and enjoyed his performance. Though I accept that he is not to everyone's taste and for that reason many people will probably not enjoy this movie. Being a Shwimmer fan here is not a necessity but it certainly helps. On the whole this is the kind of film which works well at entertaining in a kind of personal way and in a subdued setting IE.- late at night in your living room with nothing else on or perhaps a rainy Saturday afternoon. It would have been an extremely unsatisfying cinematic event though and that is probably where most of the bad press for it comes from. Definitely not perfect but none the less a decent film which is made all the more worth while if you approach it with low expectations like I did. The underlying theme is about facing up to the difficulty of that crossroads in life when we realise that perhaps its time to move on from being a carefree youth to a mature adult. If that interests you then I guess this movie you will appreciate.
