    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

    I was given free tickets to see this movie on the day that the Oklahoma city bombing occurred. So I remember it well. What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

    I was given free tickets to see this movie on the day that the Oklahoma city bombing occurred. So I remember it well. What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it.

The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

    I was given free tickets to see this movie on the day that the Oklahoma city bombing occurred. So I remember it well. What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

    I was given free tickets to see this movie on the day that the Oklahoma city bombing occurred. So I remember it well. What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    surprising that it made 28mil, as it was blown away by Gibson's braveheart, the more comic book version; Rob Roy is more raw, more interesting, better shot, better locations, but missing a screenplay that is entertaining; those defects are not helped by over the top fop tim roth who it is difficult to imagine even lifting a sword, and more so by jessica lang, who as her looks faded or something happened to create tiny little beady eyes, reverted to the quivering hand at the mouth and possibly tears school of acting; neeson is workmanlike, OK; john hurt nicely bizarre- though you should check him in his early penguin movie; all in all understandable that it faded under braveheart

    Robert McGregor was an eighteenth-century Scottish hero. The family financial problems, forcing him to borrow money from the Marquis of Montrose, and a host of adversity make him an outcast who just love a woman will give you strength to face everything. Based on the true story of the Scottish hero, who struggle against oppression, greed and tyranny of the feudal lords of the time, who only seek to increase their coffers and increase their land abusing the poorest and most vulnerable, while Rob Roy only seeks their welfare to borrow money for a cattle business and help his clan. This is expensive to fight him Rob Roy, lose their friends, their land, cattle, his brother, yet the defeat must maintain the honor and respect. The performances are superb, Liam Neeson is perfect in his role as Jessica Lange, and the good relationship between the two, Bryan Cox very good as insidious and "loose mouth" "Killearn" but he who does the best performance is Tim Roth as despicable mannered "Archibald", which acts as the right hand of the "Marquis of Montrose" (John Hurt) .. Similarly, the correct photography, costumes, production design, makeup and balanced direction Canton-Jones showing scenes of drama, action, suspense, intrigue, all in a proportionate manner. The soundtrack is also good, especially the one heard at the end of the credits.

    I was given free tickets to see this movie on the day that the Oklahoma city bombing occurred. So I remember it well. What I saw was one of the richest and most impressive movies I have ever seen. Michael Caton-Jones deserves to go down as one of the BEST director's EVER for this masterpiece. The screenplay: MASTERFUL. It has EVERYTHING: Action, suspense, drama, romance. This movie is every bit as enjoyable as the Shawshank Redemption. It is a shame that some viewers will find the realism of this movie distasteful. Personally I find the realism EXTRA tasteful. A cartoon, this is NOT. YEAH! A hundred years from now this performance from Liam Neeson will be recognized as one of his finest.

    Heavily romanticized account of a real life 18th century outlaw, Robert "Rob Roy" MacGregor (Neeson), here portrayed as a Scottish Robin Hood. MacGregor borrows money from his landowner (Hurt), only to have it stolen by the landowner's right hand man and a most dastardly villain (Roth). To add to injury to insult, the villain rapes Ferguson's wife (Lange) and torches his farm. Soon, Rob Roy is on the run and plotting revenge. Long and talky, nevertheless this epic boasts lush photography and locations, and the sets and costumes feel authentic enough. Brian "Hannibal Lecter" Cox has a meaty role as an uneasy bad guy. Besides Robin Hood, the title character is highly reminiscent of movie antiheroes like Jesse James and Billy the Kid. At the time, Neeson may not have seemed like the best choice to portray an action hero, but he does just fine. And what an action hero he has become in recent years! Who da thunk it?

    Perhaps not everyone's cup of tea, but I watched this film cuddled up with my wife, I had no idea of the plot, although I had heard vaguely about Rob Roy the great Scottish hero. The film never pretends to be an epic, and there are some beautiful performances by the actors. Liam Neeson in the lead and Jessica Lange, who looked stunning despite her bedraggled attire. Also Tim Roth is a thoroughly believable nasty piece of work. I don't know how true the story line keeps to the historical context, films like Braveheart where the French Princess was actually only 4 years old when Wallace invaded England, had plenty of made up stuff in it. However as a film this is really enjoyable, one for a romantic night in, with some excellent acting.

    Well, I've heard of this film for a few years now, only I hadn't seen it until recently. It's a respectable watch that tells a tale of highland vengeance against a sociopathic Brit. It's a basic film with a basic plot, and a very nice artistic sheen to it. We get a full rich visual of the period, and are treated to some small scale battles. If I had one complaint, it's that the revenge motivators and overall tone of anger to this film is pretty heavy. It's like Neeson's character is given no other option than to seek the path that he ultimately does. But, then again, that's kind of what the whole film is about. One of the great technical aspects is not only the art direction, but also the lensing. Very fine use of long lenses and master shots. We get true visual artistry here. The characters are all stock, but also multifaceted. Neeson isn't just a more contemporary version of Gibson's William Wallace. He has no less fire, but is more contemplative and earnest than the zealot from the middle ages. A respectable watch.

    As a Cinematic Experience, 'Rob Roy' is decent, but if you're clearly looking to see some fine acting, 'Rob Roy', just might do the trick. This 1995 Historical Drama has Liam Neeson & Tim Roth delivering performances that are so sharp & effective, that, they even manage to the hold the film, when it falters. Directed by Michael Caton-Jones, 'Rob Roy' stars Neeson as Robert Roy MacGregor, the famous Scottish folk hero and outlaw of the early 18th century, who battled with feudal landowners in the Scottish Highlands. Robert Roy MacGregor's Journey On-Screen, is decent in parts. The Writing Material is slow and slightly deary in the first-hour, but picks up the second-hour and reaches to a memorable culmination. Michael Caton-Jones's direction is satisfactory. Cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub is stunning. Editing is fair. Performance-Wise: As told, Neeson & Roth rule the show with their sharp & effective performances. Neeson gets into the skin of the character, and plays a robin-hood of his time perfectly. Roth, on the other-hand, plays the bad guy, most effectively. Jessica Lange is adequate. John Hurt & Brian Cox are fairly good. On the whole, A Must See for Neeson & Roth Fans!

    Liam Neeson is Robert Roy MacGregor, a Scot, and a natural leader who has had some shady dealings in the past but now wants to work for legitimate improvement in his lot, for him, his family, his friends. To do this he chooses to borrow 1,000 pounds from a British nobleman, for 3 months, at 1/5th interest. He will repay 1200 pounds. With this he will buy cattle and double his money with his plan. He doesn't actually want the money per se, he wants the line of credit. However his friend is fooled, convinced Rob Roy wants the money, he is given the money and set up to be robbed and killed, his body dumped in a lake, and Rob Roy left to wonder if he stole the money and took off. Meanwhile the natural tension between the Scots and the British take over, the English nobleman wants Rob Roy's land and have him imprisoned. But Rob Roy takes off, and threatens the nobleman's man, Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, a man with NO honor and only cares about himself. He actually is the one who stole the money. In turn Cunningham and his men show up at Rob Roy's home and not finding him, rape his wife, Jessica Lange as Mary MacGregor, and burn his home. This sets up the rest of the story, with Rob Roy vowing to see Cunningham dead. The nobleman is John Hurt as Montrose. His other key associate is Brian Cox as Killearn. All this sets up the final duel, with swords, between Rob Roy and Cunningham, a superior swordsman. But, guess who comes out the victor?

    Rob Roy is directed by Michael Caton-Jones and written by Alan Sharp. It stars Liam Neeson, Jessica Lange, John Hurt, Tim Roth, Eric Stoltz, Andrew Keir and Brian Cox. Music is by Carter Burwell and cinematography by Karl Walter Lindenlaub. Neeson is Rob Roy MacGregor, an 18th Century Scottish historical figure who borrows &pound;1,000 from the Marquis of Montrose (Hurt) with the plan to improve his clan's way of life. But the money is stolen in transit by the dastardly Archibald Cunnigham (Roth), so unable to repay the loan, Roy is forced to live as an outlaw. From such seeds are legends born. Beautifully shot on location in parts of the Scottish Highlands, Rob Roy somewhat got lost in the slip stream of Mel Gibson's Braveheart. A shame, for although not as epic or as rousing as Gibson's Oscar grabber, Caton-Jones' film is a different, more reflective, type of historical piece. Thematically the film is a play on virtues, in fact it's a trumpet playing fanfare for such. Honesty, honour, loyalty, fidelity and love nestle in nicely with the wonderful landscapes, born out by Sharp's intelligent script. But that's not to say that the director hasn't got the requisite thrust of stirring adventure within, he has, and Rob Roy rewards in that department also. The films crowning glory is a climatic sword fight, no tricks or hard to believe heroics, just an expertly shot long sequence that's choreographed sublimely by William Hobbs and Robert G. Goodwin. While Carter Burwell's score sits nice with the visual treats; even if the Gaelic strains within the orchestration sound more Irish than Scottish. Cast work well. Although Neeson looks the part as the robust Roy, there's no need for dashing here, character calls for strength of mind and body, as well as emotional fortitude with the love of his family, Neeson plays it with ease. Lange, an interesting casting choice as the missus, shorn of make up, yet still naturally sexy, she gives Mary MacGregor believable strength. But it's undeniably Tim Roth's movie, part effeminate fop, part calculating bastard, his villainous turn as Archibald Cunningham has to be seen to be believed. He was rightly nominated for an Academy Award for his efforts. The rest impact well, Cox and Hurt, great pros as always, and Stoltz too, isn't found wanting. There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10

    What a year for highlanders! Nothing but a coincidence, but it's still intriguing that "Rob Roy", a movie about a Scottish hero, was released the same year than another movie about another Scottish hero, William Wallace aka the titular "Braveheart", directed by Mel Gibson, and winner of the Best Picture Oscar (that's for the trivia). Yet it would be unfair to compare the two films on the simple basis of their similar settings. "Rob Roy" is not only set four centuries after the epic battles lead by William Wallace, but the film's scope is totally different, it's more a historical biopic than an epic, more about a man, about two men actually and their imminent confrontation. The two men are Liam Neeson, as Robert Roy, cattle drover and leader of the MacGregor Clan, and Tim Roth as Archibald Cunningham, the sneaky henchman of the Marquis of Montrose, played by John Hurt, and both Neeson and Roth couldn't have played more opposite characters, each one is the other's perfect nemesis and that's what make their antagonism so thrilling. Indeed, a good movie can only depend on the quality of its villain; in that case, Tim Roth creates one hell of a performance, rightfully Oscar-nominated as the evil Cunningham. Archibald Cunningham reveals the hideous face of his personality when, after having heard from Montrose's factor Killearn (Brian Cox) that Rob Roy was getting a loan of &pound;1000, steals the money from Roy's best friend, Alan McDonald (Eric Stoltz), kills him in the process, and makes Roy an official outlaw. However, Roy is given a chance to redeem himself by bearing false witness for Montrose against his main political rival the Duke of Argyl (Andrew Keir). Less than a plot device, Roy's expected refusal comes at the illustration of the definition he gave of honor in his previous scene with his children, "honor is something no one gives to you and no one can take from you". Roy is not just a skillful sword-fighter, and noble in a sort of Robin-Hood way, but he's a man of word and honor, as good as Cunningham is evil, treacherous and irredeemable. The film finds the right balance between a noble hero and a detestable villain, and it powerfully engages us in each of their story lines as they're not just one-dimensional characters. Liam Neeson towers everyone in the film, he t reminded me of the Scottish people who thought that William Wallace was 7ft tall, I wondered how good Neeson would have probably been in "Braveheart" (not that it diminish the merit of Mel Gibson) yet despite his commanding presence, there is a sort of stubbornness and relative naivety betrayed by his eyes, which compensate his huge height. On his side, Cunningman is shorter, less attractive with this sort of crisped grin and effeminate manners that fool everyone, until he uses his sword and proves to be a worthy fighter. He's got style, flamboyance while Roy is mostly seen stabbing sword on people. A lot is said about Cunningham's past as a bastard, and there's much more to know about him, not to forgive him, but to give him a certain level of depth. Yet the characterization that doesn't only rely on the performances of Neeson and Roth. Take Roy's wife, Mary, played by Jessica Lange, while she could have been your typical hero's woman, loving, caring and worrying, Mary has passion, honor, questions her husband and would be the victim of the ultimate abuse from Cunningham, in a very gut-wrenching scene. By the way, the film features much more sexual material than other historical dramas, but it's never gratuitous, each intimate moment, rape, or sexual reference serves the story and gives it a touch of authenticity a few film had the guts to portray. Would you really expect a scene where the wife would wake up and got to the beach to relieve her bladder, she could have been there for any reason, but "Rob Roy" also goes for the realistic touch, another urination is featured in the film, when Archibald wakes up, yes it's a detail, but sometimes we do remember them more than the rest of the plot. "Rob Roy" has a special attention to characters, avoiding the usual archetypes like sidekicks, romantic or comic reliefs, although Brian Cox has very funny one-liners in the film. But let's get back to Mary, and Jessica Lange gives justice to the character by not getting shadowed by her husband, she ends up playing an important part to the plot, by persuading Argyl to propose the final duel between her husband and Archibald, and this is another important touch. While the film could have used as a climax a chase sequence ending in a violent confrontation or a sort of battle between the clan members and the British soldiers, it goes straight to the point with the final duel. As if it was conscious that the viewers only care for Roy and Cunningham after having spent so much time watching them. And speaking of the climax, the film features one of the greatest and most surprising sword fights ever featured in a film, you could feel the exhaustion, the tension, the hatred between the two characters, and the conclusion is absolutely unpredictable even in its predictability. The sword fight is the determinant element of the film, without which it would have been passably good instead of great. "Rob Roy" is a magnificent looking, and thrilling historical drama, signed by Michael Caton- Jones, it doesn't have the epic scope of "Braveheart", or the gruesome battles, but it has some characters that immediately stick in your mind, and features some spectacular action sequences. "Rob Roy" is great entertainment that deserves more recognition.

There's some iffy accents at times, so what's new? And if I'm to be churlish, then it often feels wrong in period. But they are small complaints in what is otherwise a smart and lovely splinter from the swashbuckling tree. 8/10
