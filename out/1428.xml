    It is always dangerous to make any kind of statement about what previous films may have influenced a particular filmmaker, but this film is easily identifiable as what could only be called "post-Linklater," with some similarities to his early film Slacker, and maybe Smith's Clerks. Hopefully the filmmakers would not be unhappy with that comparison. Two groups of suburban slackers drive around Calgary trying to score weed, while a third group attempts to retrieve instruments from a locked apartment. Along the way, there are discussions about women and haircuts, and a whole lot of suburban "scenery" (malls, roads, residential neighborhoods, arcades), such as it is. Calgary could be a stand in for any suburb on the continent. Accordingly, anyone who has found themselves completely bored in such an environment ought to enjoy this sedate slice of life. It's a quiet film with several amusing moments. I enjoyed it, mainly because the characters and settings were familiar (though I'm not from Calgary). The actors do a pretty good job of it as 20-something suburbanites trying to stay awake in the malaise and ennui of their test pattern surroundings. Definitely worth a watch, if you don't mind a (mostly) plot less film that centers around dialog. Cool soundtrack.

    I found this movie to be quite amusing. It basically revolves around 3 sets of slackers who are just hanging aroung in Calgary. I found it annoying how the Arabic group pretty much only ever spoke in Arabic and there were no subtitles. Because of that I thought that they were pretty useless in regards to the movie because, naturally, you don't know what they're saying. Nonetheless, I enjoyed the movie. It was quite funny for the most part. I also found all of the scenery of parking lots and Calgary roads to be quite interesting and different. I was also surprised because I was expecting much more foul language. So, anyhow if you want to watch something a little different and amusing, try the SUBURBANATORS!
