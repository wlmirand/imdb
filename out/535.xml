 <sinopse>
  Maggie's and Sam's former partners are in love; she wants revenge and he wants his lost love back, so they work together to break up the happy couple.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Good-natured astronomer Sam is devastated when the love of his life, Linda, leaves him for a suave Frenchman named Anton. He therefore does what every other normal dumpee would do; go to New York and set up home in the abandoned building opposite his ex-girlfriend's apartment, intent on winning her back and waiting until she decides to leave her current lover. What Sam does not count on is being joined several weeks later by ultra hip tomboy Maggie, a photographer and motor-cyclist who is determined to get revenge on Anton, her ex-fiance. Hostile at first, the two of them eventually join forces in an attempt to separate the couple, and ruin Anton's life. However, complications ensue when Sam and Maggie start falling for each other.

    This is not a chick film. Actually it's more of a guy film, and probably why it got so many bad reviews and rating, and why a movie so great could be so under-appreciated. Some women who will see this film will see a guy being dumped trying to win the girl back and obsessing about her will immediately feel disgusted and say "Ewwww! What a creep!" They just don't understand what real love is in real life and how complicated it is for guys, especially nice guys. Let me explain - This movie is a Romantic movie with comedy in it, people in love, however ITs a Dark romantic film, it's realistic kind of love, not the one that we are usually are being fed with by most romantic chick films. This movie is about betrayal, obsession and what love is really all about. If you are a guy who ever experienced being dumped or rejected by women after trying so hard to be a nice guy and win a girl heart with love, kindness and basically being a doormat and have your heart broken - This is the movie you must see. Because We all have a little Sam in us who wants to believe in true love, sometimes we are a bit hung up on past lovers and we all stalked our ex's, if it's on Facebook or through friends, and sometimes we still want to love that special someone that dumped us and we are positive that person will realize the mistake he has done and come running back... This is why this movie is so unique, a movie that will leave a mark on you after you watch it. I've first watched it when I was just a kid, and 12 years later I still remember it and have to watch it again and againÂ… I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

    She plays like a vingative and bad-girl (even better way,nothing to weep and get depressed like a melo-dramatic cause for lost love) everything to wreck a intolerable and mellow affair.Meg Ryan was Different but this role simply is RomCom (Meg's Trademark)A A very big emphasis is Meg Ryan putting her hands on the cockroaches. What a Brave woman! does Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johnhasson stand for a few seconds a few handfuls of cockroaches without knocking the despair? And not to mention that She played the pranks worthy Eminent Characters Cartoon like Bugs Bunny,Pink Panther,Jerry(from Tom & Jerry),Meg rides a Kawasaki,She makes tricks.Meg 's puppy girl, so cute.... Eternal youth 4 Meg Ryan.

    This is a romantic comedy with a rather hard edge, or, to put it differently, a European-style farce with a too cushy ending. Apparently, this film was conceived as a Meg Ryan vehicle, i.e. as a product suitable for her established screen persona. This was a mistake. The cast choice (and the marketing) make the outcome of the film blatantly obvious and that takes away too much suspense from the viewing experience. Also, the film makers did not have the courage to bring the misfortunes heaped upon Anton Depeaux (played very well by Tcheky Karyo) to their logical conclusion. It's designed as a chick-flick and thus everyone's gotta be happy at the end. A more emotionally ambiguous ending could have turned this into something special.

    Sam is an astronomer who has been together with his school teacher girlfriend Linda about forever.Then she takes a job in New York and finds a new man in her life, a suave French restaurateur Anton.He settles to an abandoned building across the street from Anton's apartment.He starts spying on Anton and his ex, he even borrows a camera obscura from his observatory which projects a life-size image from the apartment.Later he is joined by Maggie, Anton's bitter ex with vengeance on her mind.Now those two try to break up their old sweethearts, in a way or another.Addicted to Love (1997) is actor/director Griffin Dunne's directorial debut.And it's a very nice debut.Matthew Broderick does top-notch work as Sam.His character is a nice guy who ends up making the wrong decisions.Meg Ryan does a very nice job as Maggie.Her character may be a little annoying from time to time, but I guess she grows on you.Kelly Preston is terrific as Linda.Tch&eacute;ky Karyo is brilliant as Anton.Maureen Stapleton makes a marvelous Nana.Nesbitt Blaisdell is very good as Ed Green.And so is Larry Pine as Street comic.Director's late great father Dominick Dunne portrays Matheson.The movie has pretty many funny and tragicomic scenes.One of them is when Linda's father reads the note to Sam his daughter has left.It is quite intriguing to watch all those ways they use to break up the couple and to make Anton's life miserable.The vendor's monkey wearing lipstick kisses Anton.They plant roaches in Anton's restaurant when a famous critic is dining there.You start feeling some sort of pity for the man when Maggie has caused him an allergic reaction from strawberries and Sam accidentally hurts the guy in a physical way.In a series of romantic comedies this is pretty original.

    Matthew Broderick, Meg Ryan and Kelly Preston star in Addicted to love. Perhaps I am a bit too late on writing the review. Considering this movie came out 12 years ago. But here I am ,writng the review for this pretty funny and fun romantic comedy. Broderick stars as Sam, an astronomer who's wife(Kelly Preston) starts having an affair with a french man named Antawne in New York. So Sam travels down to New York to stalk them. While there, he meets a strange woman named Maggie(Played by Meg Ryan). It turns out that Maggie used to date Antawne, and she is stalking him. So while stalking their ex-lovers, they both fall for each other. Of course they do. I'll admit that the movie ain't art. But I found this movie amusing and funny. There are a lot of funny lines, such as"If you ever do that to me again... i'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull".Or something like that. Like pretty much all romantic comedies, the ending is of course predictable. But with this one I didn't mind. It's a good movie. Addicted to love:***/****

    This is a wretched, wrong-headed little waste of celluloid. Do not be deceived by the film's strange sleight of hand, mis-focusing the audience on Broderick and Ryan. This is actually a story about a young woman (Kelly Preston) from America and an immigrant from France (Tcheky Karyo) who meet in New York and fall in love. Preston, raised in a small town, finally spreads her wings and flies away to the big city in pursuit of her dreams. There she meets Karyo, the man of her dreams, who loves America where he has come to achieve his dreams. Sadly the two of them are dogged by their sicko, stalking ex-lovers who conspire to wreak mayhem upon them and turn their dreams into a nightmare. Broderick and Ryan commit heinous crimes, including invasion of privacy (on multiple levels), stalking, and breaking and entering. They are seriously disturbed voyeurs who generate no chemistry and no sympathy. I was touched only by the steady, true love of Preston and Karyo which even overcomes the sinister machinations of Broderick and Ryan. The film attempts to get the audience to identify with the sickos, instead of the true protagonists of this film. Unfortunately, their characters provide no chemistry and nothing with which I could identify. I just felt compassion for the two objects of their demented malevolence. In a comment thread on this film, someone suggested the film's ending was too pat - that there was too much neat "resolution." To the contrary, this film provides too LITTLE resolution. After the twin menaces of Broderick and Ryan finally depart, were Preston and Karyo able to reconstruct their lives of love and security and promise? Or were they forever reduced to penury as a result of Broderick's and Ryan's conspiracy? The acting in this film is pedestrian except for Karyo, who is quite good. Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick never come close to portraying 3-dimensional characters - much less, likable ones - or achieving any on-screen chemistry. This is a pitiful excuse for a romance or a comedy or a romantic comedy. Tragically, this film is about two people from disparate backgrounds who, against all odds meet, fall in love and build a dream life only to have it devastated by two contemptuous criminals from their past. There was nothing funny about two deranged, deluded people utterly destroying the lives of two other people who have found love, happiness and success together in the big city. For me, causing misery in the lives of others is a poor basis for comedy.

    Addicted to love is one of those forgotten jewels that not so many people has been lucky enough to see, It is with the Cohen brothers "Raising Arizona" one of the perfect comedy film for me! It has a lovely story, charming and great acting performances, hilarious and catching script, beautiful music,and a so intelligent and sensitive direction. The film has it all in the perfect dose, the fun, the romance,the action, even the morality. Griffin rules !! I've seen the movie lots of times, but I still enjoying it as the first time... I love it, my kids love it, we always imitate the dialogs between us,one of my all time favorites movies ever.

    Addicted to Love delivers more than it promises. The summary for this work was less than inspired, however, the work itself is quite well done. This one has a few twists, a good screen play, and some wonderful dialog. I really enjoyed this one. This is probably one of Broderick's best performances; one among many. He was sincere, fresh, and utterly believable. Meg Ryan also contributed her usual stellar performance. I've never seen a single movie of hers, which did not allow me to enjoy her performance...yes, even In The Cut. This was a "black" rom/com, which is something of a unique occurrence. It is also a bittersweet, chaotic mess, but then again, so is life. I found it very refreshing. It rates a 7.6/10 from... the Fiend :.

    I apologize if this is more about Meg Ryan than the movie but I just saw this flick for the first time tonight despite meaning to check it out for years frankly. I just expected more from Meg Ryan -- more from her career to be honest. She plays her standard semi-bimbo, semi-slick and yet semi-alluring chick with little substance and not much thought it seems for how her dialogue progresses -- DOA and the Presidio some to mind. Her career is chock full of meaningful characters that defined themselves with any number of strong emotional traits. Even her small supporting role in Top Gun was incredibly well done, despite the arguably contrived and cheesy nature of the film (you have to admit -- cheese doesn't get better). She was electric in that movie -- Harry Met Sally of course is another. You felt her true emotion. I'm a hetero male so it takes a lot of soul-searching to write something bad about Meg. LOL. I just think she's a little one dimensional in a lot of her films and Addicted to Love is one of them. I have no idea what her character is truly thinking in most scenes and what her motivation is. I think that a lot of her troubles are poor script choices. But no one is forcing her. I would skip it or wait for cable.

    The obsessive nature of romantic love, the ardor and persistence of rejected suitors are highly complementary to the intensity of life in Manhattan, the setting. Of course, the setting is also appropriate for the idea of spying through windows. Haven't we all yearned for the love object and ridiculously obsessed about them after failing in romance? The ingenuity of invention displayed by the characters played by Meg Ryan, the more radical of the two, and Matthew Broderick, who appears the more normal one to the mainstream audience, is very amusing. Griffin Dunne showed wonderful taste in directing this movie. It's interesting, witty, and the production values are good.

    This is not a chick film. Actually it's more of a guy film, and probably why it got so many bad reviews and rating, and why a movie so great could be so under-appreciated. Some women who will see this film will see a guy being dumped trying to win the girl back and obsessing about her will immediately feel disgusted and say "Ewwww! What a creep!" They just don't understand what real love is in real life and how complicated it is for guys, especially nice guys. Let me explain - This movie is a Romantic movie with comedy in it, people in love, however ITs a Dark romantic film, it's realistic kind of love, not the one that we are usually are being fed with by most romantic chick films. This movie is about betrayal, obsession and what love is really all about. If you are a guy who ever experienced being dumped or rejected by women after trying so hard to be a nice guy and win a girl heart with love, kindness and basically being a doormat and have your heart broken - This is the movie you must see. Because We all have a little Sam in us who wants to believe in true love, sometimes we are a bit hung up on past lovers and we all stalked our ex's, if it's on Facebook or through friends, and sometimes we still want to love that special someone that dumped us and we are positive that person will realize the mistake he has done and come running back... This is why this movie is so unique, a movie that will leave a mark on you after you watch it. I've first watched it when I was just a kid, and 12 years later I still remember it and have to watch it again and againÂ… I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

    She plays like a vingative and bad-girl (even better way,nothing to weep and get depressed like a melo-dramatic cause for lost love) everything to wreck a intolerable and mellow affair.Meg Ryan was Different but this role simply is RomCom (Meg's Trademark)A A very big emphasis is Meg Ryan putting her hands on the cockroaches. What a Brave woman! does Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johnhasson stand for a few seconds a few handfuls of cockroaches without knocking the despair? And not to mention that She played the pranks worthy Eminent Characters Cartoon like Bugs Bunny,Pink Panther,Jerry(from Tom & Jerry),Meg rides a Kawasaki,She makes tricks.Meg 's puppy girl, so cute.... Eternal youth 4 Meg Ryan.

    This is a romantic comedy with a rather hard edge, or, to put it differently, a European-style farce with a too cushy ending. Apparently, this film was conceived as a Meg Ryan vehicle, i.e. as a product suitable for her established screen persona. This was a mistake. The cast choice (and the marketing) make the outcome of the film blatantly obvious and that takes away too much suspense from the viewing experience. Also, the film makers did not have the courage to bring the misfortunes heaped upon Anton Depeaux (played very well by Tcheky Karyo) to their logical conclusion. It's designed as a chick-flick and thus everyone's gotta be happy at the end. A more emotionally ambiguous ending could have turned this into something special.

    Sam is an astronomer who has been together with his school teacher girlfriend Linda about forever.Then she takes a job in New York and finds a new man in her life, a suave French restaurateur Anton.He settles to an abandoned building across the street from Anton's apartment.He starts spying on Anton and his ex, he even borrows a camera obscura from his observatory which projects a life-size image from the apartment.Later he is joined by Maggie, Anton's bitter ex with vengeance on her mind.Now those two try to break up their old sweethearts, in a way or another.Addicted to Love (1997) is actor/director Griffin Dunne's directorial debut.And it's a very nice debut.Matthew Broderick does top-notch work as Sam.His character is a nice guy who ends up making the wrong decisions.Meg Ryan does a very nice job as Maggie.Her character may be a little annoying from time to time, but I guess she grows on you.Kelly Preston is terrific as Linda.Tch&eacute;ky Karyo is brilliant as Anton.Maureen Stapleton makes a marvelous Nana.Nesbitt Blaisdell is very good as Ed Green.And so is Larry Pine as Street comic.Director's late great father Dominick Dunne portrays Matheson.The movie has pretty many funny and tragicomic scenes.One of them is when Linda's father reads the note to Sam his daughter has left.It is quite intriguing to watch all those ways they use to break up the couple and to make Anton's life miserable.The vendor's monkey wearing lipstick kisses Anton.They plant roaches in Anton's restaurant when a famous critic is dining there.You start feeling some sort of pity for the man when Maggie has caused him an allergic reaction from strawberries and Sam accidentally hurts the guy in a physical way.In a series of romantic comedies this is pretty original.

    Matthew Broderick, Meg Ryan and Kelly Preston star in Addicted to love. Perhaps I am a bit too late on writing the review. Considering this movie came out 12 years ago. But here I am ,writng the review for this pretty funny and fun romantic comedy. Broderick stars as Sam, an astronomer who's wife(Kelly Preston) starts having an affair with a french man named Antawne in New York. So Sam travels down to New York to stalk them. While there, he meets a strange woman named Maggie(Played by Meg Ryan). It turns out that Maggie used to date Antawne, and she is stalking him. So while stalking their ex-lovers, they both fall for each other. Of course they do. I'll admit that the movie ain't art. But I found this movie amusing and funny. There are a lot of funny lines, such as"If you ever do that to me again... i'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull".Or something like that. Like pretty much all romantic comedies, the ending is of course predictable. But with this one I didn't mind. It's a good movie. Addicted to love:***/****

    This is a wretched, wrong-headed little waste of celluloid. Do not be deceived by the film's strange sleight of hand, mis-focusing the audience on Broderick and Ryan. This is actually a story about a young woman (Kelly Preston) from America and an immigrant from France (Tcheky Karyo) who meet in New York and fall in love. Preston, raised in a small town, finally spreads her wings and flies away to the big city in pursuit of her dreams. There she meets Karyo, the man of her dreams, who loves America where he has come to achieve his dreams. Sadly the two of them are dogged by their sicko, stalking ex-lovers who conspire to wreak mayhem upon them and turn their dreams into a nightmare. Broderick and Ryan commit heinous crimes, including invasion of privacy (on multiple levels), stalking, and breaking and entering. They are seriously disturbed voyeurs who generate no chemistry and no sympathy. I was touched only by the steady, true love of Preston and Karyo which even overcomes the sinister machinations of Broderick and Ryan. The film attempts to get the audience to identify with the sickos, instead of the true protagonists of this film. Unfortunately, their characters provide no chemistry and nothing with which I could identify. I just felt compassion for the two objects of their demented malevolence. In a comment thread on this film, someone suggested the film's ending was too pat - that there was too much neat "resolution." To the contrary, this film provides too LITTLE resolution. After the twin menaces of Broderick and Ryan finally depart, were Preston and Karyo able to reconstruct their lives of love and security and promise? Or were they forever reduced to penury as a result of Broderick's and Ryan's conspiracy? The acting in this film is pedestrian except for Karyo, who is quite good. Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick never come close to portraying 3-dimensional characters - much less, likable ones - or achieving any on-screen chemistry. This is a pitiful excuse for a romance or a comedy or a romantic comedy. Tragically, this film is about two people from disparate backgrounds who, against all odds meet, fall in love and build a dream life only to have it devastated by two contemptuous criminals from their past. There was nothing funny about two deranged, deluded people utterly destroying the lives of two other people who have found love, happiness and success together in the big city. For me, causing misery in the lives of others is a poor basis for comedy.

    Addicted to love is one of those forgotten jewels that not so many people has been lucky enough to see, It is with the Cohen brothers "Raising Arizona" one of the perfect comedy film for me! It has a lovely story, charming and great acting performances, hilarious and catching script, beautiful music,and a so intelligent and sensitive direction. The film has it all in the perfect dose, the fun, the romance,the action, even the morality. Griffin rules !! I've seen the movie lots of times, but I still enjoying it as the first time... I love it, my kids love it, we always imitate the dialogs between us,one of my all time favorites movies ever.

    Addicted to Love delivers more than it promises. The summary for this work was less than inspired, however, the work itself is quite well done. This one has a few twists, a good screen play, and some wonderful dialog. I really enjoyed this one. This is probably one of Broderick's best performances; one among many. He was sincere, fresh, and utterly believable. Meg Ryan also contributed her usual stellar performance. I've never seen a single movie of hers, which did not allow me to enjoy her performance...yes, even In The Cut. This was a "black" rom/com, which is something of a unique occurrence. It is also a bittersweet, chaotic mess, but then again, so is life. I found it very refreshing. It rates a 7.6/10 from... the Fiend :.

    I apologize if this is more about Meg Ryan than the movie but I just saw this flick for the first time tonight despite meaning to check it out for years frankly. I just expected more from Meg Ryan -- more from her career to be honest. She plays her standard semi-bimbo, semi-slick and yet semi-alluring chick with little substance and not much thought it seems for how her dialogue progresses -- DOA and the Presidio some to mind. Her career is chock full of meaningful characters that defined themselves with any number of strong emotional traits. Even her small supporting role in Top Gun was incredibly well done, despite the arguably contrived and cheesy nature of the film (you have to admit -- cheese doesn't get better). She was electric in that movie -- Harry Met Sally of course is another. You felt her true emotion. I'm a hetero male so it takes a lot of soul-searching to write something bad about Meg. LOL. I just think she's a little one dimensional in a lot of her films and Addicted to Love is one of them. I have no idea what her character is truly thinking in most scenes and what her motivation is. I think that a lot of her troubles are poor script choices. But no one is forcing her. I would skip it or wait for cable.

    The obsessive nature of romantic love, the ardor and persistence of rejected suitors are highly complementary to the intensity of life in Manhattan, the setting. Of course, the setting is also appropriate for the idea of spying through windows. Haven't we all yearned for the love object and ridiculously obsessed about them after failing in romance? The ingenuity of invention displayed by the characters played by Meg Ryan, the more radical of the two, and Matthew Broderick, who appears the more normal one to the mainstream audience, is very amusing. Griffin Dunne showed wonderful taste in directing this movie. It's interesting, witty, and the production values are good.

    She plays like a vingative and bad-girl (even better way,nothing to weep and get depressed like a melo-dramatic cause for lost love) everything to wreck a intolerable and mellow affair.Meg Ryan was Different but this role simply is RomCom (Meg's Trademark)A A very big emphasis is Meg Ryan putting her hands on the cockroaches. What a Brave woman! does Julia Roberts, Jennifer Aniston, Scarlett Johnhasson stand for a few seconds a few handfuls of cockroaches without knocking the despair? And not to mention that She played the pranks worthy Eminent Characters Cartoon like Bugs Bunny,Pink Panther,Jerry(from Tom & Jerry),Meg rides a Kawasaki,She makes tricks.Meg 's puppy girl, so cute.... Eternal youth 4 Meg Ryan.

    This is a romantic comedy with a rather hard edge, or, to put it differently, a European-style farce with a too cushy ending. Apparently, this film was conceived as a Meg Ryan vehicle, i.e. as a product suitable for her established screen persona. This was a mistake. The cast choice (and the marketing) make the outcome of the film blatantly obvious and that takes away too much suspense from the viewing experience. Also, the film makers did not have the courage to bring the misfortunes heaped upon Anton Depeaux (played very well by Tcheky Karyo) to their logical conclusion. It's designed as a chick-flick and thus everyone's gotta be happy at the end. A more emotionally ambiguous ending could have turned this into something special.

    Sam is an astronomer who has been together with his school teacher girlfriend Linda about forever.Then she takes a job in New York and finds a new man in her life, a suave French restaurateur Anton.He settles to an abandoned building across the street from Anton's apartment.He starts spying on Anton and his ex, he even borrows a camera obscura from his observatory which projects a life-size image from the apartment.Later he is joined by Maggie, Anton's bitter ex with vengeance on her mind.Now those two try to break up their old sweethearts, in a way or another.Addicted to Love (1997) is actor/director Griffin Dunne's directorial debut.And it's a very nice debut.Matthew Broderick does top-notch work as Sam.His character is a nice guy who ends up making the wrong decisions.Meg Ryan does a very nice job as Maggie.Her character may be a little annoying from time to time, but I guess she grows on you.Kelly Preston is terrific as Linda.Tch&eacute;ky Karyo is brilliant as Anton.Maureen Stapleton makes a marvelous Nana.Nesbitt Blaisdell is very good as Ed Green.And so is Larry Pine as Street comic.Director's late great father Dominick Dunne portrays Matheson.The movie has pretty many funny and tragicomic scenes.One of them is when Linda's father reads the note to Sam his daughter has left.It is quite intriguing to watch all those ways they use to break up the couple and to make Anton's life miserable.The vendor's monkey wearing lipstick kisses Anton.They plant roaches in Anton's restaurant when a famous critic is dining there.You start feeling some sort of pity for the man when Maggie has caused him an allergic reaction from strawberries and Sam accidentally hurts the guy in a physical way.In a series of romantic comedies this is pretty original.

    Matthew Broderick, Meg Ryan and Kelly Preston star in Addicted to love. Perhaps I am a bit too late on writing the review. Considering this movie came out 12 years ago. But here I am ,writng the review for this pretty funny and fun romantic comedy. Broderick stars as Sam, an astronomer who's wife(Kelly Preston) starts having an affair with a french man named Antawne in New York. So Sam travels down to New York to stalk them. While there, he meets a strange woman named Maggie(Played by Meg Ryan). It turns out that Maggie used to date Antawne, and she is stalking him. So while stalking their ex-lovers, they both fall for each other. Of course they do. I'll admit that the movie ain't art. But I found this movie amusing and funny. There are a lot of funny lines, such as"If you ever do that to me again... i'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull".Or something like that. Like pretty much all romantic comedies, the ending is of course predictable. But with this one I didn't mind. It's a good movie. Addicted to love:***/****

    This is a wretched, wrong-headed little waste of celluloid. Do not be deceived by the film's strange sleight of hand, mis-focusing the audience on Broderick and Ryan. This is actually a story about a young woman (Kelly Preston) from America and an immigrant from France (Tcheky Karyo) who meet in New York and fall in love. Preston, raised in a small town, finally spreads her wings and flies away to the big city in pursuit of her dreams. There she meets Karyo, the man of her dreams, who loves America where he has come to achieve his dreams. Sadly the two of them are dogged by their sicko, stalking ex-lovers who conspire to wreak mayhem upon them and turn their dreams into a nightmare. Broderick and Ryan commit heinous crimes, including invasion of privacy (on multiple levels), stalking, and breaking and entering. They are seriously disturbed voyeurs who generate no chemistry and no sympathy. I was touched only by the steady, true love of Preston and Karyo which even overcomes the sinister machinations of Broderick and Ryan. The film attempts to get the audience to identify with the sickos, instead of the true protagonists of this film. Unfortunately, their characters provide no chemistry and nothing with which I could identify. I just felt compassion for the two objects of their demented malevolence. In a comment thread on this film, someone suggested the film's ending was too pat - that there was too much neat "resolution." To the contrary, this film provides too LITTLE resolution. After the twin menaces of Broderick and Ryan finally depart, were Preston and Karyo able to reconstruct their lives of love and security and promise? Or were they forever reduced to penury as a result of Broderick's and Ryan's conspiracy? The acting in this film is pedestrian except for Karyo, who is quite good. Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick never come close to portraying 3-dimensional characters - much less, likable ones - or achieving any on-screen chemistry. This is a pitiful excuse for a romance or a comedy or a romantic comedy. Tragically, this film is about two people from disparate backgrounds who, against all odds meet, fall in love and build a dream life only to have it devastated by two contemptuous criminals from their past. There was nothing funny about two deranged, deluded people utterly destroying the lives of two other people who have found love, happiness and success together in the big city. For me, causing misery in the lives of others is a poor basis for comedy.

    Addicted to love is one of those forgotten jewels that not so many people has been lucky enough to see, It is with the Cohen brothers "Raising Arizona" one of the perfect comedy film for me! It has a lovely story, charming and great acting performances, hilarious and catching script, beautiful music,and a so intelligent and sensitive direction. The film has it all in the perfect dose, the fun, the romance,the action, even the morality. Griffin rules !! I've seen the movie lots of times, but I still enjoying it as the first time... I love it, my kids love it, we always imitate the dialogs between us,one of my all time favorites movies ever.

    Addicted to Love delivers more than it promises. The summary for this work was less than inspired, however, the work itself is quite well done. This one has a few twists, a good screen play, and some wonderful dialog. I really enjoyed this one. This is probably one of Broderick's best performances; one among many. He was sincere, fresh, and utterly believable. Meg Ryan also contributed her usual stellar performance. I've never seen a single movie of hers, which did not allow me to enjoy her performance...yes, even In The Cut. This was a "black" rom/com, which is something of a unique occurrence. It is also a bittersweet, chaotic mess, but then again, so is life. I found it very refreshing. It rates a 7.6/10 from... the Fiend :.

    I apologize if this is more about Meg Ryan than the movie but I just saw this flick for the first time tonight despite meaning to check it out for years frankly. I just expected more from Meg Ryan -- more from her career to be honest. She plays her standard semi-bimbo, semi-slick and yet semi-alluring chick with little substance and not much thought it seems for how her dialogue progresses -- DOA and the Presidio some to mind. Her career is chock full of meaningful characters that defined themselves with any number of strong emotional traits. Even her small supporting role in Top Gun was incredibly well done, despite the arguably contrived and cheesy nature of the film (you have to admit -- cheese doesn't get better). She was electric in that movie -- Harry Met Sally of course is another. You felt her true emotion. I'm a hetero male so it takes a lot of soul-searching to write something bad about Meg. LOL. I just think she's a little one dimensional in a lot of her films and Addicted to Love is one of them. I have no idea what her character is truly thinking in most scenes and what her motivation is. I think that a lot of her troubles are poor script choices. But no one is forcing her. I would skip it or wait for cable.

    The obsessive nature of romantic love, the ardor and persistence of rejected suitors are highly complementary to the intensity of life in Manhattan, the setting. Of course, the setting is also appropriate for the idea of spying through windows. Haven't we all yearned for the love object and ridiculously obsessed about them after failing in romance? The ingenuity of invention displayed by the characters played by Meg Ryan, the more radical of the two, and Matthew Broderick, who appears the more normal one to the mainstream audience, is very amusing. Griffin Dunne showed wonderful taste in directing this movie. It's interesting, witty, and the production values are good.

    This is not a chick film. Actually it's more of a guy film, and probably why it got so many bad reviews and rating, and why a movie so great could be so under-appreciated. Some women who will see this film will see a guy being dumped trying to win the girl back and obsessing about her will immediately feel disgusted and say "Ewwww! What a creep!" They just don't understand what real love is in real life and how complicated it is for guys, especially nice guys. Let me explain - This movie is a Romantic movie with comedy in it, people in love, however ITs a Dark romantic film, it's realistic kind of love, not the one that we are usually are being fed with by most romantic chick films. This movie is about betrayal, obsession and what love is really all about. If you are a guy who ever experienced being dumped or rejected by women after trying so hard to be a nice guy and win a girl heart with love, kindness and basically being a doormat and have your heart broken - This is the movie you must see. Because We all have a little Sam in us who wants to believe in true love, sometimes we are a bit hung up on past lovers and we all stalked our ex's, if it's on Facebook or through friends, and sometimes we still want to love that special someone that dumped us and we are positive that person will realize the mistake he has done and come running back... This is why this movie is so unique, a movie that will leave a mark on you after you watch it. I've first watched it when I was just a kid, and 12 years later I still remember it and have to watch it again and againÂ… I hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did.

    Sam is an astronomer who has been together with his school teacher girlfriend Linda about forever.Then she takes a job in New York and finds a new man in her life, a suave French restaurateur Anton.He settles to an abandoned building across the street from Anton's apartment.He starts spying on Anton and his ex, he even borrows a camera obscura from his observatory which projects a life-size image from the apartment.Later he is joined by Maggie, Anton's bitter ex with vengeance on her mind.Now those two try to break up their old sweethearts, in a way or another.Addicted to Love (1997) is actor/director Griffin Dunne's directorial debut.And it's a very nice debut.Matthew Broderick does top-notch work as Sam.His character is a nice guy who ends up making the wrong decisions.Meg Ryan does a very nice job as Maggie.Her character may be a little annoying from time to time, but I guess she grows on you.Kelly Preston is terrific as Linda.Tch&eacute;ky Karyo is brilliant as Anton.Maureen Stapleton makes a marvelous Nana.Nesbitt Blaisdell is very good as Ed Green.And so is Larry Pine as Street comic.Director's late great father Dominick Dunne portrays Matheson.The movie has pretty many funny and tragicomic scenes.One of them is when Linda's father reads the note to Sam his daughter has left.It is quite intriguing to watch all those ways they use to break up the couple and to make Anton's life miserable.The vendor's monkey wearing lipstick kisses Anton.They plant roaches in Anton's restaurant when a famous critic is dining there.You start feeling some sort of pity for the man when Maggie has caused him an allergic reaction from strawberries and Sam accidentally hurts the guy in a physical way.In a series of romantic comedies this is pretty original.

    Matthew Broderick, Meg Ryan and Kelly Preston star in Addicted to love. Perhaps I am a bit too late on writing the review. Considering this movie came out 12 years ago. But here I am ,writng the review for this pretty funny and fun romantic comedy. Broderick stars as Sam, an astronomer who's wife(Kelly Preston) starts having an affair with a french man named Antawne in New York. So Sam travels down to New York to stalk them. While there, he meets a strange woman named Maggie(Played by Meg Ryan). It turns out that Maggie used to date Antawne, and she is stalking him. So while stalking their ex-lovers, they both fall for each other. Of course they do. I'll admit that the movie ain't art. But I found this movie amusing and funny. There are a lot of funny lines, such as"If you ever do that to me again... i'll rip out your eyes and rape your skull".Or something like that. Like pretty much all romantic comedies, the ending is of course predictable. But with this one I didn't mind. It's a good movie. Addicted to love:***/****

    This is a wretched, wrong-headed little waste of celluloid. Do not be deceived by the film's strange sleight of hand, mis-focusing the audience on Broderick and Ryan. This is actually a story about a young woman (Kelly Preston) from America and an immigrant from France (Tcheky Karyo) who meet in New York and fall in love. Preston, raised in a small town, finally spreads her wings and flies away to the big city in pursuit of her dreams. There she meets Karyo, the man of her dreams, who loves America where he has come to achieve his dreams. Sadly the two of them are dogged by their sicko, stalking ex-lovers who conspire to wreak mayhem upon them and turn their dreams into a nightmare. Broderick and Ryan commit heinous crimes, including invasion of privacy (on multiple levels), stalking, and breaking and entering. They are seriously disturbed voyeurs who generate no chemistry and no sympathy. I was touched only by the steady, true love of Preston and Karyo which even overcomes the sinister machinations of Broderick and Ryan. The film attempts to get the audience to identify with the sickos, instead of the true protagonists of this film. Unfortunately, their characters provide no chemistry and nothing with which I could identify. I just felt compassion for the two objects of their demented malevolence. In a comment thread on this film, someone suggested the film's ending was too pat - that there was too much neat "resolution." To the contrary, this film provides too LITTLE resolution. After the twin menaces of Broderick and Ryan finally depart, were Preston and Karyo able to reconstruct their lives of love and security and promise? Or were they forever reduced to penury as a result of Broderick's and Ryan's conspiracy? The acting in this film is pedestrian except for Karyo, who is quite good. Meg Ryan and Matthew Broderick never come close to portraying 3-dimensional characters - much less, likable ones - or achieving any on-screen chemistry. This is a pitiful excuse for a romance or a comedy or a romantic comedy. Tragically, this film is about two people from disparate backgrounds who, against all odds meet, fall in love and build a dream life only to have it devastated by two contemptuous criminals from their past. There was nothing funny about two deranged, deluded people utterly destroying the lives of two other people who have found love, happiness and success together in the big city. For me, causing misery in the lives of others is a poor basis for comedy.

    Addicted to love is one of those forgotten jewels that not so many people has been lucky enough to see, It is with the Cohen brothers "Raising Arizona" one of the perfect comedy film for me! It has a lovely story, charming and great acting performances, hilarious and catching script, beautiful music,and a so intelligent and sensitive direction. The film has it all in the perfect dose, the fun, the romance,the action, even the morality. Griffin rules !! I've seen the movie lots of times, but I still enjoying it as the first time... I love it, my kids love it, we always imitate the dialogs between us,one of my all time favorites movies ever.

    Addicted to Love delivers more than it promises. The summary for this work was less than inspired, however, the work itself is quite well done. This one has a few twists, a good screen play, and some wonderful dialog. I really enjoyed this one. This is probably one of Broderick's best performances; one among many. He was sincere, fresh, and utterly believable. Meg Ryan also contributed her usual stellar performance. I've never seen a single movie of hers, which did not allow me to enjoy her performance...yes, even In The Cut. This was a "black" rom/com, which is something of a unique occurrence. It is also a bittersweet, chaotic mess, but then again, so is life. I found it very refreshing. It rates a 7.6/10 from... the Fiend :.

    I apologize if this is more about Meg Ryan than the movie but I just saw this flick for the first time tonight despite meaning to check it out for years frankly. I just expected more from Meg Ryan -- more from her career to be honest. She plays her standard semi-bimbo, semi-slick and yet semi-alluring chick with little substance and not much thought it seems for how her dialogue progresses -- DOA and the Presidio some to mind. Her career is chock full of meaningful characters that defined themselves with any number of strong emotional traits. Even her small supporting role in Top Gun was incredibly well done, despite the arguably contrived and cheesy nature of the film (you have to admit -- cheese doesn't get better). She was electric in that movie -- Harry Met Sally of course is another. You felt her true emotion. I'm a hetero male so it takes a lot of soul-searching to write something bad about Meg. LOL. I just think she's a little one dimensional in a lot of her films and Addicted to Love is one of them. I have no idea what her character is truly thinking in most scenes and what her motivation is. I think that a lot of her troubles are poor script choices. But no one is forcing her. I would skip it or wait for cable.

    The obsessive nature of romantic love, the ardor and persistence of rejected suitors are highly complementary to the intensity of life in Manhattan, the setting. Of course, the setting is also appropriate for the idea of spying through windows. Haven't we all yearned for the love object and ridiculously obsessed about them after failing in romance? The ingenuity of invention displayed by the characters played by Meg Ryan, the more radical of the two, and Matthew Broderick, who appears the more normal one to the mainstream audience, is very amusing. Griffin Dunne showed wonderful taste in directing this movie. It's interesting, witty, and the production values are good.
