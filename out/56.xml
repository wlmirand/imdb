    Yes, this movie is the best I've ever seen. Not only the screenplay, the dialogs, the humor and the plot are outstanding, but also things you remember after the first, second, third and hundredth time transform it to a unique experience. I'm thinking of the burger scene, the car scene and a whole bunch of over awesome things that I won't mention because of spoilers. I love how Tarantino tells his stories every time, the different parts and additionally in Pulp Fiction the "wrong order" that creates it a pretty difficult movie to understand and more or less forces you to watch it multiple times. Amazing. The actors have no rival, the plot is smart and funny, the camera work is simply awesome. I love this movie. FIN

    "Pulp Fiction"Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term "pulp fiction" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap "pulp" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof).

    I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

    I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them. It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect &nbsp;his possessions. &nbsp; First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus. &nbsp;Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. &nbsp;Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. &nbsp;Epilogue is also them at a restaurant. If there's a word describes this movie, it must be "crazy" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness. &nbsp;I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but &nbsp;For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger! The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.

    There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!

    This is on of my favorite movies of all times. Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it, but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is. The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times.

    "Pulp Fiction" is the first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation. If you're part of it you loved this movie. If you'd let the world pass you by you spent the entire movie scratching your head like a past due Bob Dole. If you're with it, "Pulp Fiction" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances.Combined with the odd soundtrack that all Tarantino fans come to know and love, the movie's tone is set as a relaxing then shifts pace to anxious and again. One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene.

    I know the review is coming a bit late and the movie is all famous. But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review. The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages. The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner. The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie. It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be.

    There are not that many movies where a director/writer can get a performance from actors beyond their limits. Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent. If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, this movie is a bucket list TOP 10.

    "Pulp Fiction"Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term "pulp fiction" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap "pulp" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof).

    I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

    I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them. It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect &nbsp;his possessions. &nbsp; First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus. &nbsp;Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. &nbsp;Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. &nbsp;Epilogue is also them at a restaurant. If there's a word describes this movie, it must be "crazy" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness. &nbsp;I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but &nbsp;For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger! The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.

    There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!

    This is on of my favorite movies of all times. Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it, but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is. The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times.

    "Pulp Fiction" is the first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation. If you're part of it you loved this movie. If you'd let the world pass you by you spent the entire movie scratching your head like a past due Bob Dole. If you're with it, "Pulp Fiction" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances.Combined with the odd soundtrack that all Tarantino fans come to know and love, the movie's tone is set as a relaxing then shifts pace to anxious and again. One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene.

    I know the review is coming a bit late and the movie is all famous. But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review. The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages. The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner. The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie. It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be.

    There are not that many movies where a director/writer can get a performance from actors beyond their limits. Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent. If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, this movie is a bucket list TOP 10.

    Yes, this movie is the best I've ever seen. Not only the screenplay, the dialogs, the humor and the plot are outstanding, but also things you remember after the first, second, third and hundredth time transform it to a unique experience. I'm thinking of the burger scene, the car scene and a whole bunch of over awesome things that I won't mention because of spoilers. I love how Tarantino tells his stories every time, the different parts and additionally in Pulp Fiction the "wrong order" that creates it a pretty difficult movie to understand and more or less forces you to watch it multiple times. Amazing. The actors have no rival, the plot is smart and funny, the camera work is simply awesome. I love this movie. FIN

The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.

    There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!

    This is on of my favorite movies of all times. Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it, but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is. The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times.

    "Pulp Fiction" is the first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation. If you're part of it you loved this movie. If you'd let the world pass you by you spent the entire movie scratching your head like a past due Bob Dole. If you're with it, "Pulp Fiction" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances.Combined with the odd soundtrack that all Tarantino fans come to know and love, the movie's tone is set as a relaxing then shifts pace to anxious and again. One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene.

    I know the review is coming a bit late and the movie is all famous. But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review. The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages. The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner. The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie. It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be.

    There are not that many movies where a director/writer can get a performance from actors beyond their limits. Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent. If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, this movie is a bucket list TOP 10.

    Yes, this movie is the best I've ever seen. Not only the screenplay, the dialogs, the humor and the plot are outstanding, but also things you remember after the first, second, third and hundredth time transform it to a unique experience. I'm thinking of the burger scene, the car scene and a whole bunch of over awesome things that I won't mention because of spoilers. I love how Tarantino tells his stories every time, the different parts and additionally in Pulp Fiction the "wrong order" that creates it a pretty difficult movie to understand and more or less forces you to watch it multiple times. Amazing. The actors have no rival, the plot is smart and funny, the camera work is simply awesome. I love this movie. FIN

    "Pulp Fiction"Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term "pulp fiction" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap "pulp" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof).

    I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

    I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them. It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect &nbsp;his possessions. &nbsp; First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus. &nbsp;Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. &nbsp;Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. &nbsp;Epilogue is also them at a restaurant. If there's a word describes this movie, it must be "crazy" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness. &nbsp;I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but &nbsp;For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger! The story I like most is second.

    "Pulp Fiction" is the first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation. If you're part of it you loved this movie. If you'd let the world pass you by you spent the entire movie scratching your head like a past due Bob Dole. If you're with it, "Pulp Fiction" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances.Combined with the odd soundtrack that all Tarantino fans come to know and love, the movie's tone is set as a relaxing then shifts pace to anxious and again. One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene.

    I know the review is coming a bit late and the movie is all famous. But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review. The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages. The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner. The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie. It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be.

    There are not that many movies where a director/writer can get a performance from actors beyond their limits. Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent. If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, this movie is a bucket list TOP 10.

    Yes, this movie is the best I've ever seen. Not only the screenplay, the dialogs, the humor and the plot are outstanding, but also things you remember after the first, second, third and hundredth time transform it to a unique experience. I'm thinking of the burger scene, the car scene and a whole bunch of over awesome things that I won't mention because of spoilers. I love how Tarantino tells his stories every time, the different parts and additionally in Pulp Fiction the "wrong order" that creates it a pretty difficult movie to understand and more or less forces you to watch it multiple times. Amazing. The actors have no rival, the plot is smart and funny, the camera work is simply awesome. I love this movie. FIN

    "Pulp Fiction"Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term "pulp fiction" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap "pulp" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof).

    I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

    I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them. It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect &nbsp;his possessions. &nbsp; First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus. &nbsp;Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. &nbsp;Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. &nbsp;Epilogue is also them at a restaurant. If there's a word describes this movie, it must be "crazy" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness. &nbsp;I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but &nbsp;For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger! The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.

    There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!

    This is on of my favorite movies of all times. Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it, but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is. The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times.

    I know the review is coming a bit late and the movie is all famous. But I would still provide my Tarantino's pulp for this review. The story - Tarantino's mastery with simplistic plots is sure something to cherish. This story is about how certain events in two gangsters life are connecting dots to a few other lives. The comic-violence and the street-smart dialogues add to the linkages. The dialogue - The hamburger scene, the do you believe in god scene, the first scene, and a lot of mini scenes in the movie are worth memorizing. Not only are they funny in their own way, they manage to raise high order questions in a very simple manner. The actors - all of them are splendid. Travolta, Thurman, Jackson and a cameo by Bruce Willis are all essaying characters which have everything set right. The tempo they set by their expressions takes the simple plot to the level of a legendary movie. It should technically be given a 10/10, but there coulnt be a perfect movie, no matter how perfect I claim this to be.

    There are not that many movies where a director/writer can get a performance from actors beyond their limits. Quentin is definitely one of a kind because he not only pays so much attention to details in any scene, he has amazing vision to see what comes out from a fragment of whole movie - the big picture. Pulp Fiction is not scared of criticism and it does have censorship all over it, not to mention how bravely it is in showing society taboo concepts! This movie has defined so much great actors, a catalyst for their careers - John Travolta, Uma Thurman, Tim Roth, Bruce Willis, Ving Rhames, Steve Buscemi, Christopher Walken and Samuel - right now all well known actors and thanks to Tarantino we had a great generation of movies with them, full of potential and talent. If you are a fan of Tarantino's work, this movie is a bucket list TOP 10.

    Yes, this movie is the best I've ever seen. Not only the screenplay, the dialogs, the humor and the plot are outstanding, but also things you remember after the first, second, third and hundredth time transform it to a unique experience. I'm thinking of the burger scene, the car scene and a whole bunch of over awesome things that I won't mention because of spoilers. I love how Tarantino tells his stories every time, the different parts and additionally in Pulp Fiction the "wrong order" that creates it a pretty difficult movie to understand and more or less forces you to watch it multiple times. Amazing. The actors have no rival, the plot is smart and funny, the camera work is simply awesome. I love this movie. FIN

    "Pulp Fiction"Is one of those have to see action drama you have to see.There is dancing lust fighting .This movie was meant for adults There is strong sexual content nudity. Lot's of gun play even sword fighting .See the story play out from several point's of view with each of the main character's.Drug use fast past unexpected ending.It pull's you in very first seen.The term "pulp fiction" refers to a literary genre used to describe magazines printed on cheap "pulp" paper in the first half of the 20th century. Before the days of TV, pulps were how young adults learned about popular culture and the criminal underworld. Stories were often grossly exaggerated and explicit for the times. It is this energy of the genre that Tarantino is trying to exhibit in the film Pulp Fiction, the same way he exhibits his love for the film genre grind house in the 2007 film of the same name (also shown separately as Death Proof).

    I liked the way Quentin Tarentino he took the story back and ford and how he developed the inciting incident in the storytelling. The character development for the protagonist was great. John Travolta's performance was great. He knows how to transform a character and leads viewers to believe one thing instead of what it really is. Uma Thurman delivered a spectacular performance. She can really bring a character to it's maximum state of craziness. The cinematography could have used more work but overall it was good. I always thought Tarentino can show viewers different types of movies. He can take a story and develop it to make some drastic moves. Overall is a must watch kind of movie since everyone can interpret it differently.

    I've watched all films that Tarantino directed but for me this Pulp Fiction is the best of all of them. It's a little bit difficult to explain this movie. This looks like a omnibus and consists of prologue , three stories and epilogue.They seem to be disconnected but after watching, everything is connected. Prologue is about a couple planning to burgle a restaurant and two man from Mafia Vincent and Jules . They takes a order from their boss Marsellus to collect &nbsp;his possessions. &nbsp; First story is about Vincent and Marsellus's wife Vega. He is asked to take care of her by Marsellus. &nbsp;Second is about one boxer who refuses to order to lose on purpose. &nbsp;Third is about Vincent and Jules again. They happen to kill a man and asks a professional to solve. &nbsp;Epilogue is also them at a restaurant. If there's a word describes this movie, it must be "crazy" in a good sense. All of the stories are completely crazy, full of sex talks and violence, and there's no message from this. However, I do love this craziness. &nbsp;I have to admit that Tarantino really has a great sense of humor and is good at creating wonderful characters. Particularly, I like Jules acted by Samuel Jackson. I'm fascinated by his way of speak and the scene he recites Ezekiel 25:17. It's imprinted on my mind. Also I think conversations of this movie are really amusing. They're meaningless and not important but &nbsp;For instance, one about hamburger is awesome. Every time after watching, I come to want to eat a hamburger! The story I like most is second. The scene Bruce Willis and Ving Rhames get caught and they kick asses of stupid two young guys is amazing! This is a cheap B movie. But it's waste to miss this sophisticated story , direction like music and enjoyable acting. After watching, you may feel refreshing and have a desire to watch again.

    There is no other word to describe this film. Everything from the casting to the choice of music is perfect in my opinion. There is humour, violence, shock, it has everything a film needs, and they are all portrayed in a sensational way. For people who haven't seen the film, it is a collection of stories, all jumbled out of chronological order, and all are somehow intertwined. The individual stories themselves are wonderful, and I would watch them on their own. The way that Tarantino has put all the stories together, so that we still aren't sure how they all connect until right at the end, is amazing. The film somehow has a gritty reality to it, even though some of the events that happen are ridiculous, they are believable all the same. The amazing thing is that Tarantino always manages to produce incredible films. This is IMO the best film that he has made (and probably ever made!), and for any fan, or in fact anyone who has not seen this film yet, go out and buy it now!

    This is on of my favorite movies of all times. Not to mention that Quentin Tarantino is probable one of my favorite directors on top of it, but this movie is just one more prime example of why that is. The performances of John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson are riveting to watch and leave the viewer wanting more. Let us not forget the cameo performance either. Wonderful job to Quentin for pulling of yet another stunning performance on the big screen. The screen write is unprecedented to anything that has been released until now and has set the bar for future films to come. If you are looking for a film of the decade you have found it. This is definitely a film to last through the times.

    "Pulp Fiction" is the first masterwork of the post-modern pop culture generation. If you're part of it you loved this movie. If you'd let the world pass you by you spent the entire movie scratching your head like a past due Bob Dole. If you're with it, "Pulp Fiction" gets better with every viewing, and like good rock n' roll, needs to be played loud! One of the zaniest, funniest, smartest and most entertaining movies I have ever seen. One of my all time favorites as well. John Travolta and Samuel L. Jackson give terrific performances.Combined with the odd soundtrack that all Tarantino fans come to know and love, the movie's tone is set as a relaxing then shifts pace to anxious and again. One could not watch this movie once but twice to fully understand what is going on. Samuel L. Jackson, John Travolta, Tim Roth, Uma Thurman, Ving Rhames, Bruce Willis, Harvey Keitel and Tarantino himself, this movie boasts quite the roster and more than makes up with it with the incredible acting, or even dancing if you were into that scene.
