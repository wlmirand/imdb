    It was right about at this time in John Travolta's career that he won the battle...the battle of convincing me that he was an actor of note. I grew up with Travolta on "Welcome Back Kotter", and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an "okay" actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays. The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out. Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does "okay". Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like. Bruce Young seemed an odd choice as an FBI agent. The film doesn't have a happy ending, but it's just about the only ending that it could have. Highly recommended, at least once.

    This movie was in my cable last week and for some reason, I never heard about it. "Phenomenon" isn't a known movie in Brazil, but that didn't stop me watching it. In the first minutes, John Travolta's character gains a strange power that makes him extremely intelligent. For obvious reasons, people start threatening him, living up to the famous phrase "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Cast has common performances, with highlight to the bar fighting scenes. Even thought the plot doesn't get deeply into a romance or anything, we have beautiful messages and thoughts about life in general; George Malley is a great character and sometimes I could identify myself with him. The ending is beautiful and not that clich&eacute;. Worth it.

    John Travolta's "Phenomenon" from 1996 is similar to "Powder", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. "Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!

    It was right about at this time in John Travolta's career that he won the battle...the battle of convincing me that he was an actor of note. I grew up with Travolta on "Welcome Back Kotter", and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an "okay" actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays. The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out. Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does "okay". Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like. Bruce Young seemed an odd choice as an FBI agent. The film doesn't have a happy ending, but it's just about the only ending that it could have. Highly recommended, at least once.

    This movie was in my cable last week and for some reason, I never heard about it. "Phenomenon" isn't a known movie in Brazil, but that didn't stop me watching it. In the first minutes, John Travolta's character gains a strange power that makes him extremely intelligent. For obvious reasons, people start threatening him, living up to the famous phrase "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Cast has common performances, with highlight to the bar fighting scenes. Even thought the plot doesn't get deeply into a romance or anything, we have beautiful messages and thoughts about life in general; George Malley is a great character and sometimes I could identify myself with him. The ending is beautiful and not that clich&eacute;. Worth it.

    John Travolta's "Phenomenon" from 1996 is similar to "Powder", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. "Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis.

I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!

    It was right about at this time in John Travolta's career that he won the battle...the battle of convincing me that he was an actor of note. I grew up with Travolta on "Welcome Back Kotter", and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an "okay" actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays. The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out. Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does "okay". Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like. Bruce Young seemed an odd choice as an FBI agent. The film doesn't have a happy ending, but it's just about the only ending that it could have. Highly recommended, at least once.

    This movie was in my cable last week and for some reason, I never heard about it. "Phenomenon" isn't a known movie in Brazil, but that didn't stop me watching it. In the first minutes, John Travolta's character gains a strange power that makes him extremely intelligent. For obvious reasons, people start threatening him, living up to the famous phrase "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Cast has common performances, with highlight to the bar fighting scenes. Even thought the plot doesn't get deeply into a romance or anything, we have beautiful messages and thoughts about life in general; George Malley is a great character and sometimes I could identify myself with him. The ending is beautiful and not that clich&eacute;. Worth it.

    John Travolta's "Phenomenon" from 1996 is similar to "Powder", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. "Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!

    It was right about at this time in John Travolta's career that he won the battle...the battle of convincing me that he was an actor of note. I grew up with Travolta on "Welcome Back Kotter", and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an "okay" actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays. The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out. Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does "okay". Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like. Bruce Young seemed an odd choice as an FBI agent. The film doesn't have a happy ending, but it's just about the only ending that it could have. Highly recommended, at least once.

    This movie was in my cable last week and for some reason, I never heard about it. "Phenomenon" isn't a known movie in Brazil, but that didn't stop me watching it. In the first minutes, John Travolta's character gains a strange power that makes him extremely intelligent. For obvious reasons, people start threatening him, living up to the famous phrase "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Cast has common performances, with highlight to the bar fighting scenes. Even thought the plot doesn't get deeply into a romance or anything, we have beautiful messages and thoughts about life in general; George Malley is a great character and sometimes I could identify myself with him. The ending is beautiful and not that clich&eacute;. Worth it.

    John Travolta's "Phenomenon" from 1996 is similar to "Powder", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. "Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!

    It was right about at this time in John Travolta's career that he won the battle...the battle of convincing me that he was an actor of note. I grew up with Travolta on "Welcome Back Kotter", and I was not impressed. A number of movies went by, and I saw a few...and became cautiously optimistic that maybe he was at least an "okay" actor. But with a few films right around 1996, including this one, he won me over. No, he's no Laurence Olivier, but he's a very pleasant and often very interesting actor. This may be his best role, although you don't realize it until well into the movie when he begins to have a sort of breakdown, and you see the transformation of the character he plays. The story is a good one...a man she some flashes of light in the sky and suddenly becomes brilliant, learns things remarkably fast, develops complex and original ideas, etc. Of course, the government gets involved, and eventually -- when they realize he will soon die -- they want to do open brain surgery to learn as much as they can. Will they succeed? Meanwhile, throughout the film he is trying to win the heart of Kyra Sedgwick...who's a hold out of sorts...the rest of the town loves him...until his weirdness begins to freak them out. Personally, I'm not a fan of Kyra Sedgwick, and I wouldn't have cast her in this role...although she does "okay". Similarly, I wouldn't have chosen Forest Whitaker as the role of best friend. Robert Duvall is another actor I never cared for...but, it has been re-looking at roles like this that have led to me reconsidering the quality of his acting, and I have to admit I was wrong...he was and is a terrific actor, and demonstrates that again here. It was nice to see Richard Kiley as the brain specialist here, not that his character is one you are apt to like. Bruce Young seemed an odd choice as an FBI agent. The film doesn't have a happy ending, but it's just about the only ending that it could have. Highly recommended, at least once.

    This movie was in my cable last week and for some reason, I never heard about it. "Phenomenon" isn't a known movie in Brazil, but that didn't stop me watching it. In the first minutes, John Travolta's character gains a strange power that makes him extremely intelligent. For obvious reasons, people start threatening him, living up to the famous phrase "the nail that sticks out gets hammered". Cast has common performances, with highlight to the bar fighting scenes. Even thought the plot doesn't get deeply into a romance or anything, we have beautiful messages and thoughts about life in general; George Malley is a great character and sometimes I could identify myself with him. The ending is beautiful and not that clich&eacute;. Worth it.

    John Travolta's "Phenomenon" from 1996 is similar to "Powder", which came out some eight months earlier. Both films are about a gifted individual with unusual powers and the reactions of those around him. "Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

"Phenomenon" differs from "Powder" in that it's about a regular guy (Travolta) who suddenly gains amazing abilities, rather than an outcast who already has them. The other characters include a woman whom he wants to date (Kyra Sedgwick), his best friend (Forest Whitaker), his doctor (Robert Duvall), a marveling professor and miscellaneous townsfolk & government agents. The story takes place in a small town in Northern California (shot in Auburn, CA). This is an interesting "What if?" story. What would happen if an average Joe suddenly attained genius and telekinesis? The film explores the untapped power of the mind and spirit. What great things would we be able to do if we were able to tap into this vast reservoir of potential! The ordinary person might likely respond with skepticism, but the story is based on numerous real-life examples, albeit perhaps not as pronounced as Travolta's character. I've had my own run-ins with such things. For instance, about five years ago I was in bed having an intense dream when my wife burst into the room to wake me up. The smoke alarm outside the door was blaring like crazy, but there was no smoke or fire (or heat). The intense energy evoked by my dream obviously set it off because, as soon as I woke, it suddenly stopped. If there was any doubt, the same thing happened the next week. What can explain this except the untapped power of the mind and focused energy? Another example comes to mind, albeit different: when I was around 8 years old my family and I were walking the trails of Theodore Wirth Park in Minneapolis when we came to the edge of a baseball field. As soon as we entered the outfield somehow I just knew that the current batter was going to hit the ball and it was going to hit me right in the face. I knew this but I didn't know how I knew it. I just knew. Next thing you know the batter hits the ball high into the air -- it was like slow motion -- and it came and hit me right on the cheek! (Good thing it was a softball, huh?). How did I KNOW this was going to happen? I don't know, but it's pretty amazing and it shows the power of the mind and spirit to warn us, which some call intuition. It goes without saying that "Phenomenon" is worthwhile just for effectively exploring such amazing things and provoking thought. Travolta's character is somewhat of a type of Christ in the story, which makes the ending a bit unsatisfying. I don't want to say too much (no spoilers), but the question arises: If he possesses the genius and power to do all that he does in the film, why couldn't he use these powers to deal with a certain situation at the end? To me, the writers and filmmakers took the easy way out by giving us a "realistic" ending. In short, they played it safe. Still, this is a good movie if you like dramas and the subject matter piques your interest. The film runs 123 minutes. GRADE: B

    Although the story of the movie was OK it was the main characters is what made the movie worth. This was another movie showing that when someone is different and cant be explained for how they are some people tend not to be very kind to that person. Even though the movie is kind of science fiction it seems more of a plausible story that could actually happen. After what could be explained as a phenomenon experienced by a small town mechanic, suddenly has peculiar powers that end up making his life worse then better. People in the town start to make fun of him and treat him bad, but when something bad happens they come to him to help and he does. With his new found powers he starts to solve his every day problems and of others around him. He starts to devour books increasing his knowledge and starts to turn him into almost a circus side show, also ends up cracking some government codes and ends up being arrested and held in a secret location and thinking he is some kind of spy. The romance that develops between Travolta and Sedgewick and the chemistry they seem to have makes this another must see movie. This should be a must see movie for anyone who enjoys movies.

    An obvious propaganda for Travolta's own philosophy (Scientology), with poor acting and minimal character bonds. The emotional ties are unestablished in this movie, and the characters aren't all that likable. The plot takes quite some time to get on the role and when it finally starts it is lackluster at best. I was entirely uninterested, flipping through several games on my laptop as the movie ran. Relationships are preestablished, or entirely jumped into without any actual build up. The mother is a horrible mother at the very least... George is painful on screen. Overall, the only enjoyable part was a 30-second segment. I would not recommend this to anyone, and honestly don't understand how the first three pages of reviews are positive. When the character finally dies, it is like..."so...?". I think there could've been potential with "Man Gains Super Intelligence", but this idiotic small-town lovable dope wasn't the way about it.

    They say that the average person only uses about five percent of their available brain power. This film examines what might happen if one were to unleash the remaining ninety five percent. Actually, that could be a very scary thought, as we see what happens to George Malley (John Travolta) when he begins to develop a super-human learning ability and the power of telekinesis. So there's also the fear of the unknown thrown into the mix, as George's friends and neighbors are at first amazed and then wary of George's ability, as if he might possibly turn his powers against them. I generally don't remark on a film's IMDb rating, but this one is bafflingly low at 6.3 as I write this. Travolta and the supporting cast are quite competent in their roles, with Kyra Sedgwick valiantly walking that fine line of guarding against another hurtful relationship balanced against finding that special someone who she can open her heart to once again. For once a film capably tells it's story without resorting to the principals hitting the sack in an obligatory love scene. What I also liked about the film was the way George's true friends stuck by him through thick and thin. Nate (Forest Whitaker) and Doc (Robert Duvall) never wavered in their loyalty even if it meant going against some of the locals who were willing to throw George under the bus. All in all, this was a heartwarming film that tells it's story with a bit of whimsy on it's way to a life affirming message about achieving one's full potential.

    I'm not sure how to classify this movie or whether I even should. Is it a scifi, romantic or a beautiful drama? Whatever be the genre, Phenomenon was touching & soulful. The lights that John Travolta's character experiences one night is open to interpretation and I prefer it that way. The mystery makes the movie all the more engaging & impressive to me. John Travolta(as George Malley) has given a heartfelt performance, many say, the best of his career. He was at ease in his role, being vulnerable, funny, intelligent, frustrated or even in love. The other actors who touch our hearts too are Robert Duvall(as Dr. Brunder), Forest Whitaker(as George's pal) and even the pretty Kyra Sedgwick(as John's crush, Lace) impresses. What I especially like about the movie is how the story still focuses more on the relationship between the character George and the others in the community after his life-changing experience one night that suddenly turns him into a gifted intellect. Otherwise, Phenomenon could have been just like any other superhero flick about Travolta saving the world with his bare hands or brain! The ending(final scene between George & Lace), I wish, could have been more effective. It came to an end a bit abruptly to me. Verdict: Adorable & romantic. What starts off like a scifi ends being a tale of genuine friendship, care and love.

    Well here it is. Phenomenon is a movie that is very much like Powder, this guy has super knowledge abilities and is able to manipulate objects without touching them. Hmm remind you of an older movie??? This movie stinks of rip off of Powder which was actually a Quality Film, Just because it has Travolta in it does not mean it is going to be worth a DIME. This is just my two cents here, or if your in the UK my two pence. But if you want a movie that is truly heartfelt and will make your spirit feel power and feel uplifted after watching it, this movie is not the right one... your in the wrong place... go look at Powder, one year older, 1995, less special effects technology back in 95, but one dang awesome movie that actually is not a Phenomibore and a PhenomiFAIL

    This is the best Scientology feature film I have seen. Much better than Battlefield Earth (Travolta and Whitaker again, hmm). Not as funny as Tom Cruise addressing his fellow Church Of Scientology initiates. It's subtle but evident if you know the messages the CoS wants to put out there. George is what the CoS would call a "clear," right down to the telekinesis. A couple of his speeches include lines that echo CoS language. (to Doc) "Lately I've been seeing things so clearly, you know?" (to the evil doctor) "What I'm talking about is the human spirit. That's the challenge. That's the voyage." L Ron Hubbard loved to go on about the human spirit and freeing it, through his program of large donations. There's the extraterrestrial factor, although this script leaves it to the viewer to decide whether aliens are the real explanation for George's powers. There's the demonization of psychiatric medicine and the US government. There's the one-dimensional goodness of the hero characters, nice and simple like in L Ron's pulp stories. I'm happy the CoS can't get away with stuff like this as much now, due to greater public awareness of their efforts. I wonder if it's true that they use Travolta's closeted homosexuality to compel him to do their projects.

    I saw this film for the first time on video back in 1998. Back in the 'good old days' when you could pick up a film at Blockbusters without knowing everything about it before you watched it. I think I selected it on the basis of it starring John Travolta and Robert Duvall - what appeared a slightly unlikely combination at that time. By the end of the film it had blown my mind - but not quite in the same way. Thirteen years on two things still remain seared on my mind. The piece of dialogue between George and Lace. George - "Will you love me for the rest of my life ?" Lace - "No , George....... for the rest of mine ." and the film ending and the credits running to the sound of Bryan Ferry singing 'Dance with Life' . I sobbed like a (37 year old) baby and when I awoke the next morning vowed to change the direction of my life for ever. So I did. Every year since my wife and I sit down and watch this film , celebrate it and, by so doing, say 'thank you for the bright light in the sky'. I cannot recommend this film enough. Go watch. PS - as a consequence, I forgive John Travolta anything and everything he has done since - luckily 'Look Who's Talking' I,II,III..... came before !!
