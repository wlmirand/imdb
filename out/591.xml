    Let's just say that this move lacked finesse. I hated Gere in this, he over acts, he uses stupid facial expressions too much. However, the r&ocirc;le of the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is wonderful. Such a shame she features only infrequently. I loved Edward Norton-despite Gere's awful acting he played the disturbed guilty party beautifully. There are no red herrings, nor surprises, it's all tediously predictable. John Mahoney's r&ocirc;le is nasty, and it worried me as I still see him in his Frasier part. In all it's not a bad movie just not a good one. Fancy an Archbishop of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal?!

    Did Edward Norton slip in his character of "Aaron" when he told Marty Vail that he hopes Miss Venable's throat was okay? I always wondered if he slipped and got caught or if he wanted Gere to actually know what he did because he was found not guilty? I can see no real reason why the dude would not just keep quiet about it now that he was home free. But lunatics don't really care about that stuff, I suppose. Always loved that ending. Great acting by Edward Norton, I can't imagine he did a lot of stuff before this movie. I looked up his age when the movie was made. He was 27 and played a 19 year old! The life of a Hollywood actor. He actually played a 19 year old to a tee!

    The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual. Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions). Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.

    I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!

    If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.

    It is not a logical ending. If there is no Aaron after all,then there is no tape. Roy would not compromise by all means. He would not act as a sex boy or a circus animal for the bishop. He could not stand even rude words toward him, pretending or not, the boundaries would not be that large, which means he would never ever let that sexual offense happen to himself and then go for a revenge. It just makes no sense. Yep, this ending is designed for watching not understanding. This typical drama ending makes people excited. Just it. But overall,this is a great movie. The actors did great job. Norton is incredible and Laura is freaking beautiful. Still the question,What is right and what is wrong. We are just fighting for our own justice.

    "Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.

    First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

    Being someone who's considering Law as a profession, this movie really makes you think twice about that. An altar boy accused of killing a priest is taken to court, his accused act stirring controversy and who loves controversy more than Richard Gere's character. The acting in this movie is enjoyable! Edward Norton shines throughout is the focal point of this movie! This drama really has all the basic elements of a court-drama, but with abit of sophistication and originality! This movie really does make you think twice about your morals,how naive we are and if we should feel sympathy for 'criminals'. Good watch. Great ending.

    Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands. "Fracture" tells a similar tale, Ryan Gosling playing a cocky prosecutor tasked with taking down the even cockier Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things. Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter  always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it. 7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

Great acting by Edward Norton, I can't imagine he did a lot of stuff before this movie. I looked up his age when the movie was made. He was 27 and played a 19 year old! The life of a Hollywood actor. He actually played a 19 year old to a tee!

    The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual. Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions). Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.

    I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!

    If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.

    It is not a logical ending. If there is no Aaron after all,then there is no tape. Roy would not compromise by all means. He would not act as a sex boy or a circus animal for the bishop. He could not stand even rude words toward him, pretending or not, the boundaries would not be that large, which means he would never ever let that sexual offense happen to himself and then go for a revenge. It just makes no sense. Yep, this ending is designed for watching not understanding. This typical drama ending makes people excited. Just it. But overall,this is a great movie. The actors did great job. Norton is incredible and Laura is freaking beautiful. Still the question,What is right and what is wrong. We are just fighting for our own justice.

    "Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.

    First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

    Being someone who's considering Law as a profession, this movie really makes you think twice about that. An altar boy accused of killing a priest is taken to court, his accused act stirring controversy and who loves controversy more than Richard Gere's character. The acting in this movie is enjoyable! Edward Norton shines throughout is the focal point of this movie! This drama really has all the basic elements of a court-drama, but with abit of sophistication and originality! This movie really does make you think twice about your morals,how naive we are and if we should feel sympathy for 'criminals'. Good watch. Great ending.

    Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands. "Fracture" tells a similar tale, Ryan Gosling playing a cocky prosecutor tasked with taking down the even cockier Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things. Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter  always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it. 7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Let's just say that this move lacked finesse. I hated Gere in this, he over acts, he uses stupid facial expressions too much. However, the r&ocirc;le of the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is wonderful. Such a shame she features only infrequently. I loved Edward Norton-despite Gere's awful acting he played the disturbed guilty party beautifully. There are no red herrings, nor surprises, it's all tediously predictable. John Mahoney's r&ocirc;le is nasty, and it worried me as I still see him in his Frasier part. In all it's not a bad movie just not a good one. Fancy an Archbishop of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal?!

    Did Edward Norton slip in his character of "Aaron" when he told Marty Vail that he hopes Miss Venable's throat was okay? I always wondered if he slipped and got caught or if he wanted Gere to actually know what he did because he was found not guilty? I can see no real reason why the dude would not just keep quiet about it now that he was home free. But lunatics don't really care about that stuff, I suppose. Always loved that ending.

    If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.

    It is not a logical ending. If there is no Aaron after all,then there is no tape. Roy would not compromise by all means. He would not act as a sex boy or a circus animal for the bishop. He could not stand even rude words toward him, pretending or not, the boundaries would not be that large, which means he would never ever let that sexual offense happen to himself and then go for a revenge. It just makes no sense. Yep, this ending is designed for watching not understanding. This typical drama ending makes people excited. Just it. But overall,this is a great movie. The actors did great job. Norton is incredible and Laura is freaking beautiful. Still the question,What is right and what is wrong. We are just fighting for our own justice.

    "Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.

    First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

    Being someone who's considering Law as a profession, this movie really makes you think twice about that. An altar boy accused of killing a priest is taken to court, his accused act stirring controversy and who loves controversy more than Richard Gere's character. The acting in this movie is enjoyable! Edward Norton shines throughout is the focal point of this movie! This drama really has all the basic elements of a court-drama, but with abit of sophistication and originality! This movie really does make you think twice about your morals,how naive we are and if we should feel sympathy for 'criminals'. Good watch. Great ending.

    Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands. "Fracture" tells a similar tale, Ryan Gosling playing a cocky prosecutor tasked with taking down the even cockier Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things. Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter  always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it. 7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Let's just say that this move lacked finesse. I hated Gere in this, he over acts, he uses stupid facial expressions too much. However, the r&ocirc;le of the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is wonderful. Such a shame she features only infrequently. I loved Edward Norton-despite Gere's awful acting he played the disturbed guilty party beautifully. There are no red herrings, nor surprises, it's all tediously predictable. John Mahoney's r&ocirc;le is nasty, and it worried me as I still see him in his Frasier part. In all it's not a bad movie just not a good one. Fancy an Archbishop of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal?!

    Did Edward Norton slip in his character of "Aaron" when he told Marty Vail that he hopes Miss Venable's throat was okay? I always wondered if he slipped and got caught or if he wanted Gere to actually know what he did because he was found not guilty? I can see no real reason why the dude would not just keep quiet about it now that he was home free. But lunatics don't really care about that stuff, I suppose. Always loved that ending. Great acting by Edward Norton, I can't imagine he did a lot of stuff before this movie. I looked up his age when the movie was made. He was 27 and played a 19 year old! The life of a Hollywood actor. He actually played a 19 year old to a tee!

    The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual. Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions). Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.

    I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!

    First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

    Being someone who's considering Law as a profession, this movie really makes you think twice about that. An altar boy accused of killing a priest is taken to court, his accused act stirring controversy and who loves controversy more than Richard Gere's character. The acting in this movie is enjoyable! Edward Norton shines throughout is the focal point of this movie! This drama really has all the basic elements of a court-drama, but with abit of sophistication and originality! This movie really does make you think twice about your morals,how naive we are and if we should feel sympathy for 'criminals'. Good watch. Great ending.

    Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands. "Fracture" tells a similar tale, Ryan Gosling playing a cocky prosecutor tasked with taking down the even cockier Anthony Hopkins. Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things. Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter  always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it. 7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Let's just say that this move lacked finesse. I hated Gere in this, he over acts, he uses stupid facial expressions too much. However, the r&ocirc;le of the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is wonderful. Such a shame she features only infrequently. I loved Edward Norton-despite Gere's awful acting he played the disturbed guilty party beautifully. There are no red herrings, nor surprises, it's all tediously predictable. John Mahoney's r&ocirc;le is nasty, and it worried me as I still see him in his Frasier part. In all it's not a bad movie just not a good one. Fancy an Archbishop of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal?!

    Did Edward Norton slip in his character of "Aaron" when he told Marty Vail that he hopes Miss Venable's throat was okay? I always wondered if he slipped and got caught or if he wanted Gere to actually know what he did because he was found not guilty? I can see no real reason why the dude would not just keep quiet about it now that he was home free. But lunatics don't really care about that stuff, I suppose. Always loved that ending. Great acting by Edward Norton, I can't imagine he did a lot of stuff before this movie. I looked up his age when the movie was made. He was 27 and played a 19 year old! The life of a Hollywood actor. He actually played a 19 year old to a tee!

    The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual. Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions). Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.

    I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!

    If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.

    It is not a logical ending. If there is no Aaron after all,then there is no tape. Roy would not compromise by all means. He would not act as a sex boy or a circus animal for the bishop. He could not stand even rude words toward him, pretending or not, the boundaries would not be that large, which means he would never ever let that sexual offense happen to himself and then go for a revenge. It just makes no sense. Yep, this ending is designed for watching not understanding. This typical drama ending makes people excited. Just it. But overall,this is a great movie. The actors did great job. Norton is incredible and Laura is freaking beautiful. Still the question,What is right and what is wrong. We are just fighting for our own justice.

    "Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.

Hopkins plays a genius who brazenly admits to killing his wife, knowing that the prosecution has no direct evidence against him. To say anymore about the plots of both films would be to ruin things. Both films work fairly well as popcorn potboilers, up until their last acts. At this point "Primal Fear" turns into a poor-man's "Usual Suspects", whilst "Fracture" ditches popcorn thrills for a melodramatic subplot between Gosling and a lover. Bizarrely, "Fear" spends most of its running time aiming for "Chinatown-esque" complexity, only to then jettison all its subplots in favour for a cheap "twist endings". Hoblit also miscalculates in his handling of Hopkins' character. Hopkins plays a rehash of Hannibal Lecter  always boasting and always wildly taunting his opponents - when he should be playing a far more ordinary and tragic fellow; a simple engineer driven to madness by love and lamentation. Still, Edward Norton is excellent in "Fear" and "Fracture" sports an original premise, even if it does ultimately waste it. 7.9/10 - Worth one viewing.

    Let's just say that this move lacked finesse. I hated Gere in this, he over acts, he uses stupid facial expressions too much. However, the r&ocirc;le of the psychiatrist (Frances McDormand) is wonderful. Such a shame she features only infrequently. I loved Edward Norton-despite Gere's awful acting he played the disturbed guilty party beautifully. There are no red herrings, nor surprises, it's all tediously predictable. John Mahoney's r&ocirc;le is nasty, and it worried me as I still see him in his Frasier part. In all it's not a bad movie just not a good one. Fancy an Archbishop of the Catholic Church being involved in a sex scandal?!

    Did Edward Norton slip in his character of "Aaron" when he told Marty Vail that he hopes Miss Venable's throat was okay? I always wondered if he slipped and got caught or if he wanted Gere to actually know what he did because he was found not guilty? I can see no real reason why the dude would not just keep quiet about it now that he was home free. But lunatics don't really care about that stuff, I suppose. Always loved that ending. Great acting by Edward Norton, I can't imagine he did a lot of stuff before this movie. I looked up his age when the movie was made. He was 27 and played a 19 year old! The life of a Hollywood actor. He actually played a 19 year old to a tee!

    The story is very well told, with a lot of unexpected twists. Excellent acting, especially by Edward Norton. He outplays them all, as well as his character outsmarts them all. Gere is sleazy as usual. Apart from that I dislike the film for its questionable morals that are being transported in the subtext. Every film has a message. The message of this film is basically that "clinically insane persons" are "faking their insanity". The film implies that they should be toasted on the chair instead of being sent to a medical facility. The message is: pro- death-penalty. The film also implies that women can be smart but they can not control their emotions which makes them weaker than their male counterparts (again: Norton and Gere, completely in control of their emotions). Without the moral implications this film would be a 8/10, but as explained I can not stand the very conservative political image - especially the pro-death- penalty subtext - that's being transferred in the subtext, so I'll give it a 3/10.

    I would rate this as one of top court room films I've ever seen. Even after having seen it 3 times, and knowing the plot twists, I find this film to be "riveting". Begin with a darned good story line. Young man who has been living under the auspices of a Catholic Archbishop murders the Archbishop. Immediate conclusion -- the Archbishop is have sex with older alter boys. Oops...not quite...but there is sexual angle...just not the one expected. Then, someone murders the prelate...an alter boy is arrested because he appears to be fleeing, had access, and eventually we learn he had motive. But...he has a split personality...so he gets off with time in a mental hospital. But then... In addition to a superb script and excellent dialog, what made this film click for me was a terrific cast. Richard Gere is in top form as the defense attorney...certainly one of his very best performances. Laura Linney is just as strong as the prosecuting attorney (and former love interest of Gere...which adds spice to the interplay between the two). John Mahoney ("dad" on "Frazier") appears to be a suspect and does some pretty good sweating on the stand. Alfre Woodard is excellent as the Judge. Frances McDormand is good as the psychiatrist. And, Edward Norton is interesting as the suspect. Andre Braugher and Maura Tierney are along as good assistants to Gere. Frankly, you can't ask for much more in a cast. To be honest, it's difficult for me to think of anything to criticize here. Highly recommended!

    If you want to see excellent acting in the service of an involving well told story this is a good place to start. Across the board there is not one weak performance. Gere has one of his very best roles as a fame loving attorney who chases a headline case that is more than he bargained for. He and the Laura Linney spar and parry both in and out of court with wonderful brio, she is his equal even if he is loath to admit it and the actress's personal strong persona fits the role perfectly. In a star making performance Edward Norton grabs his part by the throat and runs with it, a brilliant job and one that marked him as a true talent to watch. Each secondary roles is filled with top drawer character actors-Frances McDormand as an understanding therapist, Maura Tierney and Andre Braugher as Gere's assistants and on and on all deliver quality work. Alfre Woodard deserves special mention as the no nonsense slightly cantankerous judge who tipples a little on the side. She takes what could have been a throwaway part and makes her both memorable and humorous. A little overlong you won't notice so good is the acting and once it gets going the story keeps the interest level high.

    It is not a logical ending. If there is no Aaron after all,then there is no tape. Roy would not compromise by all means. He would not act as a sex boy or a circus animal for the bishop. He could not stand even rude words toward him, pretending or not, the boundaries would not be that large, which means he would never ever let that sexual offense happen to himself and then go for a revenge. It just makes no sense. Yep, this ending is designed for watching not understanding. This typical drama ending makes people excited. Just it. But overall,this is a great movie. The actors did great job. Norton is incredible and Laura is freaking beautiful. Still the question,What is right and what is wrong. We are just fighting for our own justice.

    "Primal Fear" has a very well-written story which targets a very fundamental question that we all are struggling with in our lives, what is right and what is wrong. Is it justified to do something immoral to achieve a right goal? Almost every character in this movie is dealing with this question and they choose to go in different directions. My main criticism to the movie is the casting. Richard Gere is playing the main role and Laura Linney is the main actress. They both are very wonderful actors but I believe they were not a suitable choice for the roles in this movie. For example, the character Richard Gere is playing is a passionate, arrogant lawyer that would suite better to someone like Al Pacino or Paul Newman.

    First of all, I accept that the acting was very good from both Richard Gere who could have been more arrogant but anyway he was a sweet guy inside in this movie and also Edward Norton who made a very good acting with his split personalities. But now let's focus on the movie how it was written. We have a boy who may be convicted with murder and everything points that he was the murderer. His courageous and famous lawyer want's to save him because he thinks that the boy didn't kill anyone. The only thing left is mental illness so a shrink is there to diagnose him. The shrink discovers his problem "split personalities". IF THIS IS TRUE THAN THE BOY DOESN'T END UP IN JAIL BUT IN A MENTAL INSTITUTE , JUST GET A COUPLE OF OTHER DOCTORS TO PROVE THIS AND CASE CLOSED. Here is our plot hole together with the twist : twist- split personalities (good twist but raises questions afterwards) plot hole - can't prove the split personalities (not true because all the lawyer should do is ask the judge and a couple of doctors can come and give a final decision about the kid ) Instead of asking other doctors Veil thinks he should prove that in the courtroom like it a show of some kind. Here we are in the courtroom the kid is being asked by the prosecution lawyer where he gets up punches his own lawyer and threaten that he will break the prosecution lawyers neck. Now everybody is convinced because of that little show that the kid is actually sick NO REAL PROOF NO DOCTORS. In the final scene the kid appears to be normal and everything was a show for him to escape the punishment. So this is the second twist and plot hole : twist - no split personalities hole - no doctor actually proved anything of this kind being or not being split personalities, and the jury doesn't need any more evidence because they are all doctors and they know what they are doing. So in conclusion this movie tries to be smart but it falls in it's own thinking. Actors are really good but they look bad from the writers. I understood who was the murder in the moment where the boy talked about his mental illness or when he gave that hateful look to the shrink. At that moment I started hating the movie not because I knew that but because of the twist that were major plot holes that made those good actors look stupid.

    Being someone who's considering Law as a profession, this movie really makes you think twice about that. An altar boy accused of killing a priest is taken to court, his accused act stirring controversy and who loves controversy more than Richard Gere's character. The acting in this movie is enjoyable! Edward Norton shines throughout is the focal point of this movie! This drama really has all the basic elements of a court-drama, but with abit of sophistication and originality! This movie really does make you think twice about your morals,how naive we are and if we should feel sympathy for 'criminals'. Good watch. Great ending.

    Gregory Hoblit directs "Primal Fear" and "Fracture", two legal thrillers. Both films watch as hotshot lawyers wage war with master criminals. In "Primal Fear" our lawyer's played by Richard Gere, a slick defence attorney who takes to the courtroom and locks horn with the even slicker Aaron Stampler (a debuting Edward Norton), a conniving psycho with blood on his hands.
