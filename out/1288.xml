 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A group of friends in New York, working away at their PCs and laptops, keep in touch exclusively by phone and fax. They are all too busy to meet face to face. Gale plays matchmaker, by phone, to Jerry and Barbara who, in turn, hit it off beautifully...via phone and fax. Martin gets a telephone call from someone he's never met. It's Denise, with some extraordinary news. Tapping away at his computer all the while, he develops a sort of friendship with Denise...via phone. And so it goes as the friends, tap, tap, tapping away, share news, hopes, and dreams...via phone and fax. Finally Gale has an unfortunate encounter with a phone, Denise has some more news for Martin, and Frank plans a gala New Year's Eve party, but will he answer the door?

    There are very good, specific comments on this film already, so I will limit mine to general, nearly abstract remarks. While some of the technology used in the film may become obsolete, the main theme is timeless. The paradox is this: as humans get more and more connected by phones, faxes, internet, and so on, they become more and more disconnected from each other. Virtual contact replaces physical contact. We are not the better for it. For raising a timeless question this movie will become a minor classic. The film has a great sense of humor. It may appeal to East Coasters, to Europeans, to fans of Woody Allen, and to lovers of independent New York comedies. Main target audience: you with the phone in the hand.

    Frank (Tim Daly) and his girlfriend, Gail, broke up five years ago but still stay in touch on the phone. It is Gail's idea to fix up her friend, Barbara with Frank's friend (Liev Schreiber). Yet, when Gail gives Barbara the man's telephone number, they get disconnected quite a few times. Once they start talking, however, their conversations definitely "heat up". Meanwhile, another friend gives a party for everyone but no one shows up. That's because everyone in this small circle of friends is agoraphobic! They work at their apartments, mostly, and they stay in touch via Ma Bell everyday. Another friend, Martin, gets a mysterious call one day from a lady named Denny. It seems she's pregnant with Martin's child, from a "donation" he gave to the local sperm bank. She calls quite often to give Martin an update. Meanwhile, one of the friends suffers a life-changing event because of a mobile phone. Will anyone of these folks ever see each other in real life? This is a highly unusual but very entertaining film. It is told almost exclusively in telephone conversations between the parties. If this sounds boring, I assure you, it is not! All of the actors are terrific and give their characters a nice depth, despite the film's premise. The usual amenities, the costumes, the sets, and the production values, are fine, also. But, most of all, the script is a winner, with great lines and originality. If you are a film fan who never plays it safe, you will thoroughly enjoy this movie. So, even if you are an agoraphobic yourself, don't miss out on this one! Send someone to the video store, if you have to, to get this film into your hands. You will be darn glad you did.

    What was supposed to be an innocent movie screening in French at the local cinema, ended up being an original screening subtitled in French. My friends were equally surprised, but, had it not been for the movie being entertaining, the evening could have been a waste of my friends' time. The story is quirky, funny and dramatic, in a way. Characters are presented both separately and together, because the only way for them to be together is by phone. There is laughter, there are tears, the characters are very well defined, and it looks like a typical New-York drama-comedy, with great jokes and dialogues between the characters. A definite *must see* for a Friday eve. with friends.

    This unusual (to say the least) comedy is well ahead of its time with a message for all of us, who are so wrapped up in our work, that we have completely "un-learned" how to enjoy life. -- A 90-minute string of phone conversations, telephone answering machine messages and e-mails ends in at least TWO PEOPLE re-connecting with life they once knew as worth living. A group of "yuppie" friends is in contact only through modern day communication systems. When a young woman (Denise) calls the sperm donor, whose child she is about to give birth to, the cyber-serene world of the clique begins to rock. The scene where one of the friends leaves a phone message to another clique member while getting into a fatal car wreck is morbitly funny. This movie resembles a very long joke that entertains you while you eventually reach the punch line. There are many laughs, but the seriousness of the message behind this comedy remains after viewing. Have we all turned into little cell-phone-toting robots? Released in 1995, this film is in tune with our changing times. This film will "hit home" with a lot of people. Recommended!

    A group of New Yorkers just have contact through telephone, fax and Internet. The conversation among them are only through telephone. The foods are ordered by telephone. Even sex is made by telephone. They are not able to go to the funeral of a common friend, or to join in a restaurant, or even to open the door for the others in a party. A creative critic to the individualism and solitude of the contemporary human beings. The difficulties of having a relationship and interact with another persons is presented in this acid comedy. A great work of edition, in a movie not indicated for all tastes. My vote is six. Title (Brazil): `Denise Est&aacute; Chamando' (`Denise Is Calling')

    I just saw this movie on WE Network and felt compelled to comment. I mean it was just, like, totally delightful! Hal Salwen has the world we live in pegged perfectly! Schreiber is spot on as the repressed shut-in, and Ubach is a standout as the quirky Denise who's struggling to reach out from her own little enclosed space. Hooray for everyone, cast and Salwen, for just a wonderfully sly, bittersweet, but ultimately satisfying experience!

    My girlfriend, an aspiring movie critic (who told me about this internet site) just brought this flick home from the video store and said she heard good things (seems they study this movie in her film classes). I was dubious... and then I was bowled over. I mean are there any more movies out there (in english, and that aren't fifty years old) that I haven't heard of that are this good? The only problem is, too many movies like this might ruin me for the knuckle-brained stuff that's in the theaters (and that I must admit I do enjoy). Still, once and awhile it's good to sip a nice wine, after overloading on diet pepsi. Try it.

    The only interest in this movie is Liev Schreiber. If it weren't for him.... I would never have watched the whole show. All it is about is talking on the phone... and about absolutely nothing. There is no great story line, no thrills, No real big surprises... not anything. Just a waste of time. There are much better things to do with your time.

    Wow. Just saw this film on cable and couldn't stop watching it. So refreshing. And brilliantly funny. A well observed, insightful farce. Like something Oscar Wilde would have written if he were alive today. Just so clever! And very well directed, the director letting the mostly unknown actors who all do a wonderful job (with the Barbara character a particular standout) just do their thing, though the camera does move at just the right moments, and the framing and editing and what have you is impeccable. But it's the writing that stands out. Of course it's an exaggeration for effect, but, I mean, it's such an obvious idea, it's been there forever-- what's happening to us in the modern world-- and this Salwen guy could see it. Anyway, Just thought I'd put it out there. Anyway, if you're into smart comedies that aren't like anything you've seen before, then see this movie if you get the chance.

    Unfortunately, I did not see this as "being right up there with 2001". I did, however, find it not unlike looking in a mirror. For two hours. With nothing else going on. And so it goes. The plot. Moved forward. At about. This pace. And the camera. Never moved. It was like. Being trapped. In a room. With Ben Stein. For two hours. There are some game performances amidst all this nonsense though, but mostly you feel sorry for the actors- clearly they thought the director had a 'concept' that was worth humiliating themselves for. The director didn't, so consequently you have a bunch of pretty talented people talking into phones for two hours. And the camera, I'm not kidding, DOES NOT MOVE. Perhaps this was shot for computer screens, I don't know, but it sure doesn't work as a film.
