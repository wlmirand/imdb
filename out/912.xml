  US Marshal Samuel Gerard (Jones) and his team of Marshals are assigned to track down Sheridan (Snipes), a murderer and robber.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  When a prisoner transport plane crashes, one prisoner, Mark Sheridan, skillfully escapes and save lives at the same time. Deputy Sam Gerard and his team of U.S. Marshals pursue relentlessly, but Gerard begins to suspect that there is more to the exceptional fugitive than what he has been told. Meanwhile, Sheridan struggles to avoid capture while seeking answers of his own. Until the final scene, both Gerard and Sheridan are in jeopardy of the unknown.

    I was never much interested in watching this spin off of The Fugitive. What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive. Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie. You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max. Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc: we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man: hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys). Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

    Forgotten sequel to 'The Fugitive' that carefully excises any trace of excitement, tension, intrigue and Harrison Ford and replaces it with a reheated plot in which returning Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones is on the trail of Wesley Snipes, whose character has been set up by somebody for some reason over something that happened at some point. Snipes escapes custody in a scene that's oddly similar to the bus crash in the original film and then pegs it around for the next two hours while Jones and his team of marshals indulge in reams of mechanical banter and solve the conspiracy or whatever. Everything that's either obvious or pointless is explained in detail while all the confusing stuff is rattled out in rapid-fire chunks of dialogue that are hard to follow. Still, by the time the real culprit is revealed I was past caring.

    While not an awful movie, "US Marshals" feels a little bit derivative and worn out. It follows the grand footprints of it's technically better and more gripping older sibling, "The Fugitive". While Tommy Lee Jones sparkled and stole the show in the earlier film, he is the focus of this newer installment. His comic relief in Marshals becomes muted, and storyline is rehashed. Wesley Snipes co-stars as the newer "Fugitive" and much of the movie is by-the-numbers. The drama and mystery is easily guessed unfortunately. The music too is tedious. However you could do a lot worse with Jones keeping many scenes afloat and in-command. Maybe worthwhile if you like Jones. Robert Downey Jr. has a lower profile role especially compared to newer movies we've seen him in. 6/10

    This is the film that Robert Downey Jr said was "possibly the worst action movie of all time." I think he's wrong. He plays Special Agent Royce, against Wesley Snipes' Mark Sheridan and in the company of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, who steals every scene he is in. Maybe Downey was a bit jealous. There's lots that is good about the film: the camera-work and the editing and the music, which is unobtrusive, as it should be. So credit to Andrjez Bartkowiak, who's been active since 1975, Terry Rawlings, who has been in films since 1957, and Jerry Goldsmith, who has been doing this stuff since 1954! Sometimes experience shows. Stuart Baird, in a rare outing as director also brings a wealth of experience in holding the whole thing together. The plot was too complex for me to take in on one viewing. This may be one of those films you need to see twice to piece things together. For me, I struggle a bit with Wesley Snipes. I know he has a big following but I just don't warm to him. His relationship with his girlfriend played by Irene Jacob, is unconvincing. It doesn't help that Jacob does not seem entirely comfortable with the English language, though she does look gorgeous. Overall, good film. Almost great. Worth a viewing.

    This is more of a spin-off than a sequel to The Fugitive because it focuses on Tommy Lee Jones' character and the U.S. Marshals which actually isn't a bad idea for a movie. It doesn't have what made The Fugitive good and to the people who say it brings nothing new to the action genre well, it's not supposed to. It's not meant to be groundbreaking it is just a popcorn flick that was meant to entertain and it works. It should have been a box office success, but it wasn't. Just like the first movie I thought it was a bit too long and could've been a bit shorter, but it's just a minor complaint. If you're looking for some cheap entertainment then this is a good choice.

    Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. Tommy Lee Jones won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, but he's not doing anything remotely reaching Oscar contention in US Marshals. It's a hastily and poorly written script with a lot of nice action sequences to cover that up. The airplane crash sequence where Snipes escapes from Jones's custody is well done as is his escape from an old age home on to the roof of a moving subway. As we know early on that Snipes is innocent, I'm here to tell you that the guilty party stands out like a sore thumb. A five year old child could tell you who the real bad guy and traitor is. Jones, Snipes and the rest of the cast do a workmanlike job. But this one is for easy to please action/adventure fans.

    What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of "The Fugitive" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard. You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When "U.S. Marshals" came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb. As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as "The Fugitive" but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in "U.S. Marshals" more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual "item" causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is. All anyone really wants to know by the end of the film is if Snipes is innocent and, if so, who is guilty.

    This is the first time i have watched this movie and this movie has been out a long time. I loved The Fugitive and the whole Sam and Dr. Richard Kimble, cat and mouse. I was a little disappointed when i realised this was going to go down the same road but the plane crash was spectacular and kept me watching and wanting to see more. I am used to seeing Snipes as a villain so to see him as the running good guy didn't really cut it for me. Downey Junior didn't need to be on screen long before I figured it out he was the one that Sam needed to be after after all and he was actually the best character in this film. This disappointed me really though as if i could figure it out so quickly that he was the bad guy and believe me I am no miss Marple surely the great Deputy could have? But hey, all ends happily and Sam gets his man, unfortunately it does result in one of the regulars being a causality. Its worth an hour or two one Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else on but as for another film, thank goodness they realised Sam couldn't handle that.

    "You wanna start running again?" - Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) "US Marshals", a sequel to "The Fugitive", finds actor Tommy Lee Jones and his band of likable trackers hot on the trail of Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes), a man wrongly convicted of a crime. Jones has become a bit of an archetype, popping up in countless cat-and-mouse/predator-and-prey movies over the years. In films like "The Fugitive, "Men In Black", "The Hunted", "Three Burials", "US Marshals", "In The Valley of Elah", "The Missing", "In The Electric Mist" and "No Country For Old Men" (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. "US Marshalls" sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters ("Marshals" rightly recognises that the coolest characters in "The Fugitive" were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun. "US Marshal's" best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in "The French Connection", in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken. Seriously. Incidentally, Wesley Snipes would find himself becoming a fugitive on the run in real life, the FBI currently tracking him for tax evasion. The film also stars Irene Jacob. What's she doing here? See her in three masterpieces: Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red", "The Double Life of Veronique", and Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds". 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    This is literally the worst movie Jones has appeared in yet. That he could act in this civil rights garbage is dumbfounding. A very sad attempted redo of the great original movie starring Harrison Ford, The Fugitive. The movie is based on the premise that a black male (Smipes) would be wrongly accused by law enforcement of murder, perhaps a 1 in 500 million chance, usually they are doing a great job at being able to catch the many criminals, many of whom happen to be black. He is accused of murder, while in a hospital after a car accident. It also is very strange that they pair Snipes up with a recent White French immigrant woman, also unlikely and not something most would promote in an expensive studio feature movie.

It also is very strange that they pair Snipes up with a recent White French immigrant woman, also unlikely and not something most would promote in an expensive studio feature movie.

    I was never much interested in watching this spin off of The Fugitive. What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive. Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie. You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max. Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc: we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man: hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys). Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

    Forgotten sequel to 'The Fugitive' that carefully excises any trace of excitement, tension, intrigue and Harrison Ford and replaces it with a reheated plot in which returning Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones is on the trail of Wesley Snipes, whose character has been set up by somebody for some reason over something that happened at some point. Snipes escapes custody in a scene that's oddly similar to the bus crash in the original film and then pegs it around for the next two hours while Jones and his team of marshals indulge in reams of mechanical banter and solve the conspiracy or whatever. Everything that's either obvious or pointless is explained in detail while all the confusing stuff is rattled out in rapid-fire chunks of dialogue that are hard to follow. Still, by the time the real culprit is revealed I was past caring.

    While not an awful movie, "US Marshals" feels a little bit derivative and worn out. It follows the grand footprints of it's technically better and more gripping older sibling, "The Fugitive". While Tommy Lee Jones sparkled and stole the show in the earlier film, he is the focus of this newer installment. His comic relief in Marshals becomes muted, and storyline is rehashed. Wesley Snipes co-stars as the newer "Fugitive" and much of the movie is by-the-numbers. The drama and mystery is easily guessed unfortunately. The music too is tedious. However you could do a lot worse with Jones keeping many scenes afloat and in-command. Maybe worthwhile if you like Jones. Robert Downey Jr. has a lower profile role especially compared to newer movies we've seen him in. 6/10

    This is the film that Robert Downey Jr said was "possibly the worst action movie of all time." I think he's wrong. He plays Special Agent Royce, against Wesley Snipes' Mark Sheridan and in the company of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, who steals every scene he is in. Maybe Downey was a bit jealous. There's lots that is good about the film: the camera-work and the editing and the music, which is unobtrusive, as it should be. So credit to Andrjez Bartkowiak, who's been active since 1975, Terry Rawlings, who has been in films since 1957, and Jerry Goldsmith, who has been doing this stuff since 1954! Sometimes experience shows. Stuart Baird, in a rare outing as director also brings a wealth of experience in holding the whole thing together. The plot was too complex for me to take in on one viewing. This may be one of those films you need to see twice to piece things together. For me, I struggle a bit with Wesley Snipes. I know he has a big following but I just don't warm to him. His relationship with his girlfriend played by Irene Jacob, is unconvincing. It doesn't help that Jacob does not seem entirely comfortable with the English language, though she does look gorgeous. Overall, good film. Almost great. Worth a viewing.

    This is more of a spin-off than a sequel to The Fugitive because it focuses on Tommy Lee Jones' character and the U.S. Marshals which actually isn't a bad idea for a movie. It doesn't have what made The Fugitive good and to the people who say it brings nothing new to the action genre well, it's not supposed to. It's not meant to be groundbreaking it is just a popcorn flick that was meant to entertain and it works. It should have been a box office success, but it wasn't. Just like the first movie I thought it was a bit too long and could've been a bit shorter, but it's just a minor complaint. If you're looking for some cheap entertainment then this is a good choice.

    Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. Tommy Lee Jones won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, but he's not doing anything remotely reaching Oscar contention in US Marshals. It's a hastily and poorly written script with a lot of nice action sequences to cover that up. The airplane crash sequence where Snipes escapes from Jones's custody is well done as is his escape from an old age home on to the roof of a moving subway. As we know early on that Snipes is innocent, I'm here to tell you that the guilty party stands out like a sore thumb. A five year old child could tell you who the real bad guy and traitor is. Jones, Snipes and the rest of the cast do a workmanlike job. But this one is for easy to please action/adventure fans.

    What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of "The Fugitive" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard. You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When "U.S. Marshals" came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb. As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as "The Fugitive" but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in "U.S. Marshals" more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual "item" causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is. All anyone really wants to know by the end of the film is if Snipes is innocent and, if so, who is guilty.

    This is the first time i have watched this movie and this movie has been out a long time. I loved The Fugitive and the whole Sam and Dr. Richard Kimble, cat and mouse. I was a little disappointed when i realised this was going to go down the same road but the plane crash was spectacular and kept me watching and wanting to see more. I am used to seeing Snipes as a villain so to see him as the running good guy didn't really cut it for me. Downey Junior didn't need to be on screen long before I figured it out he was the one that Sam needed to be after after all and he was actually the best character in this film. This disappointed me really though as if i could figure it out so quickly that he was the bad guy and believe me I am no miss Marple surely the great Deputy could have? But hey, all ends happily and Sam gets his man, unfortunately it does result in one of the regulars being a causality. Its worth an hour or two one Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else on but as for another film, thank goodness they realised Sam couldn't handle that.

    "You wanna start running again?" - Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) "US Marshals", a sequel to "The Fugitive", finds actor Tommy Lee Jones and his band of likable trackers hot on the trail of Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes), a man wrongly convicted of a crime. Jones has become a bit of an archetype, popping up in countless cat-and-mouse/predator-and-prey movies over the years. In films like "The Fugitive, "Men In Black", "The Hunted", "Three Burials", "US Marshals", "In The Valley of Elah", "The Missing", "In The Electric Mist" and "No Country For Old Men" (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. "US Marshalls" sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters ("Marshals" rightly recognises that the coolest characters in "The Fugitive" were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun. "US Marshal's" best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in "The French Connection", in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken. Seriously. Incidentally, Wesley Snipes would find himself becoming a fugitive on the run in real life, the FBI currently tracking him for tax evasion. The film also stars Irene Jacob. What's she doing here? See her in three masterpieces: Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red", "The Double Life of Veronique", and Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds". 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    This is literally the worst movie Jones has appeared in yet. That he could act in this civil rights garbage is dumbfounding. A very sad attempted redo of the great original movie starring Harrison Ford, The Fugitive. The movie is based on the premise that a black male (Smipes) would be wrongly accused by law enforcement of murder, perhaps a 1 in 500 million chance, usually they are doing a great job at being able to catch the many criminals, many of whom happen to be black.

Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc: we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man: hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys). Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

    Forgotten sequel to 'The Fugitive' that carefully excises any trace of excitement, tension, intrigue and Harrison Ford and replaces it with a reheated plot in which returning Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones is on the trail of Wesley Snipes, whose character has been set up by somebody for some reason over something that happened at some point. Snipes escapes custody in a scene that's oddly similar to the bus crash in the original film and then pegs it around for the next two hours while Jones and his team of marshals indulge in reams of mechanical banter and solve the conspiracy or whatever. Everything that's either obvious or pointless is explained in detail while all the confusing stuff is rattled out in rapid-fire chunks of dialogue that are hard to follow. Still, by the time the real culprit is revealed I was past caring.

    While not an awful movie, "US Marshals" feels a little bit derivative and worn out. It follows the grand footprints of it's technically better and more gripping older sibling, "The Fugitive". While Tommy Lee Jones sparkled and stole the show in the earlier film, he is the focus of this newer installment. His comic relief in Marshals becomes muted, and storyline is rehashed. Wesley Snipes co-stars as the newer "Fugitive" and much of the movie is by-the-numbers. The drama and mystery is easily guessed unfortunately. The music too is tedious. However you could do a lot worse with Jones keeping many scenes afloat and in-command. Maybe worthwhile if you like Jones. Robert Downey Jr. has a lower profile role especially compared to newer movies we've seen him in. 6/10

    This is the film that Robert Downey Jr said was "possibly the worst action movie of all time." I think he's wrong. He plays Special Agent Royce, against Wesley Snipes' Mark Sheridan and in the company of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, who steals every scene he is in. Maybe Downey was a bit jealous. There's lots that is good about the film: the camera-work and the editing and the music, which is unobtrusive, as it should be. So credit to Andrjez Bartkowiak, who's been active since 1975, Terry Rawlings, who has been in films since 1957, and Jerry Goldsmith, who has been doing this stuff since 1954! Sometimes experience shows. Stuart Baird, in a rare outing as director also brings a wealth of experience in holding the whole thing together. The plot was too complex for me to take in on one viewing. This may be one of those films you need to see twice to piece things together. For me, I struggle a bit with Wesley Snipes. I know he has a big following but I just don't warm to him. His relationship with his girlfriend played by Irene Jacob, is unconvincing. It doesn't help that Jacob does not seem entirely comfortable with the English language, though she does look gorgeous. Overall, good film. Almost great. Worth a viewing.

    This is more of a spin-off than a sequel to The Fugitive because it focuses on Tommy Lee Jones' character and the U.S. Marshals which actually isn't a bad idea for a movie. It doesn't have what made The Fugitive good and to the people who say it brings nothing new to the action genre well, it's not supposed to. It's not meant to be groundbreaking it is just a popcorn flick that was meant to entertain and it works. It should have been a box office success, but it wasn't. Just like the first movie I thought it was a bit too long and could've been a bit shorter, but it's just a minor complaint. If you're looking for some cheap entertainment then this is a good choice.

    Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. Tommy Lee Jones won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, but he's not doing anything remotely reaching Oscar contention in US Marshals. It's a hastily and poorly written script with a lot of nice action sequences to cover that up. The airplane crash sequence where Snipes escapes from Jones's custody is well done as is his escape from an old age home on to the roof of a moving subway. As we know early on that Snipes is innocent, I'm here to tell you that the guilty party stands out like a sore thumb. A five year old child could tell you who the real bad guy and traitor is. Jones, Snipes and the rest of the cast do a workmanlike job. But this one is for easy to please action/adventure fans.

    What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of "The Fugitive" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard. You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When "U.S. Marshals" came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb. As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as "The Fugitive" but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in "U.S. Marshals" more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual "item" causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is. All anyone really wants to know by the end of the film is if Snipes is innocent and, if so, who is guilty.

    This is the first time i have watched this movie and this movie has been out a long time. I loved The Fugitive and the whole Sam and Dr. Richard Kimble, cat and mouse. I was a little disappointed when i realised this was going to go down the same road but the plane crash was spectacular and kept me watching and wanting to see more. I am used to seeing Snipes as a villain so to see him as the running good guy didn't really cut it for me. Downey Junior didn't need to be on screen long before I figured it out he was the one that Sam needed to be after after all and he was actually the best character in this film. This disappointed me really though as if i could figure it out so quickly that he was the bad guy and believe me I am no miss Marple surely the great Deputy could have? But hey, all ends happily and Sam gets his man, unfortunately it does result in one of the regulars being a causality. Its worth an hour or two one Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else on but as for another film, thank goodness they realised Sam couldn't handle that.

    "You wanna start running again?" - Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) "US Marshals", a sequel to "The Fugitive", finds actor Tommy Lee Jones and his band of likable trackers hot on the trail of Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes), a man wrongly convicted of a crime. Jones has become a bit of an archetype, popping up in countless cat-and-mouse/predator-and-prey movies over the years. In films like "The Fugitive, "Men In Black", "The Hunted", "Three Burials", "US Marshals", "In The Valley of Elah", "The Missing", "In The Electric Mist" and "No Country For Old Men" (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. "US Marshalls" sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters ("Marshals" rightly recognises that the coolest characters in "The Fugitive" were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun. "US Marshal's" best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in "The French Connection", in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken. Seriously. Incidentally, Wesley Snipes would find himself becoming a fugitive on the run in real life, the FBI currently tracking him for tax evasion. The film also stars Irene Jacob. What's she doing here? See her in three masterpieces: Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red", "The Double Life of Veronique", and Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds". 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    This is literally the worst movie Jones has appeared in yet. That he could act in this civil rights garbage is dumbfounding. A very sad attempted redo of the great original movie starring Harrison Ford, The Fugitive. The movie is based on the premise that a black male (Smipes) would be wrongly accused by law enforcement of murder, perhaps a 1 in 500 million chance, usually they are doing a great job at being able to catch the many criminals, many of whom happen to be black. He is accused of murder, while in a hospital after a car accident. It also is very strange that they pair Snipes up with a recent White French immigrant woman, also unlikely and not something most would promote in an expensive studio feature movie.

    I was never much interested in watching this spin off of The Fugitive. What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive. Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie. You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max.

Everything that's either obvious or pointless is explained in detail while all the confusing stuff is rattled out in rapid-fire chunks of dialogue that are hard to follow. Still, by the time the real culprit is revealed I was past caring.

    While not an awful movie, "US Marshals" feels a little bit derivative and worn out. It follows the grand footprints of it's technically better and more gripping older sibling, "The Fugitive". While Tommy Lee Jones sparkled and stole the show in the earlier film, he is the focus of this newer installment. His comic relief in Marshals becomes muted, and storyline is rehashed. Wesley Snipes co-stars as the newer "Fugitive" and much of the movie is by-the-numbers. The drama and mystery is easily guessed unfortunately. The music too is tedious. However you could do a lot worse with Jones keeping many scenes afloat and in-command. Maybe worthwhile if you like Jones. Robert Downey Jr. has a lower profile role especially compared to newer movies we've seen him in. 6/10

    This is the film that Robert Downey Jr said was "possibly the worst action movie of all time." I think he's wrong. He plays Special Agent Royce, against Wesley Snipes' Mark Sheridan and in the company of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, who steals every scene he is in. Maybe Downey was a bit jealous. There's lots that is good about the film: the camera-work and the editing and the music, which is unobtrusive, as it should be. So credit to Andrjez Bartkowiak, who's been active since 1975, Terry Rawlings, who has been in films since 1957, and Jerry Goldsmith, who has been doing this stuff since 1954! Sometimes experience shows. Stuart Baird, in a rare outing as director also brings a wealth of experience in holding the whole thing together. The plot was too complex for me to take in on one viewing. This may be one of those films you need to see twice to piece things together. For me, I struggle a bit with Wesley Snipes. I know he has a big following but I just don't warm to him. His relationship with his girlfriend played by Irene Jacob, is unconvincing. It doesn't help that Jacob does not seem entirely comfortable with the English language, though she does look gorgeous. Overall, good film. Almost great. Worth a viewing.

    This is more of a spin-off than a sequel to The Fugitive because it focuses on Tommy Lee Jones' character and the U.S. Marshals which actually isn't a bad idea for a movie. It doesn't have what made The Fugitive good and to the people who say it brings nothing new to the action genre well, it's not supposed to. It's not meant to be groundbreaking it is just a popcorn flick that was meant to entertain and it works. It should have been a box office success, but it wasn't. Just like the first movie I thought it was a bit too long and could've been a bit shorter, but it's just a minor complaint. If you're looking for some cheap entertainment then this is a good choice.

    Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. Tommy Lee Jones won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, but he's not doing anything remotely reaching Oscar contention in US Marshals. It's a hastily and poorly written script with a lot of nice action sequences to cover that up. The airplane crash sequence where Snipes escapes from Jones's custody is well done as is his escape from an old age home on to the roof of a moving subway. As we know early on that Snipes is innocent, I'm here to tell you that the guilty party stands out like a sore thumb. A five year old child could tell you who the real bad guy and traitor is. Jones, Snipes and the rest of the cast do a workmanlike job. But this one is for easy to please action/adventure fans.

    What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of "The Fugitive" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard. You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When "U.S. Marshals" came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb. As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as "The Fugitive" but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in "U.S. Marshals" more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual "item" causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is. All anyone really wants to know by the end of the film is if Snipes is innocent and, if so, who is guilty.

    This is the first time i have watched this movie and this movie has been out a long time. I loved The Fugitive and the whole Sam and Dr. Richard Kimble, cat and mouse. I was a little disappointed when i realised this was going to go down the same road but the plane crash was spectacular and kept me watching and wanting to see more. I am used to seeing Snipes as a villain so to see him as the running good guy didn't really cut it for me. Downey Junior didn't need to be on screen long before I figured it out he was the one that Sam needed to be after after all and he was actually the best character in this film. This disappointed me really though as if i could figure it out so quickly that he was the bad guy and believe me I am no miss Marple surely the great Deputy could have? But hey, all ends happily and Sam gets his man, unfortunately it does result in one of the regulars being a causality. Its worth an hour or two one Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else on but as for another film, thank goodness they realised Sam couldn't handle that.

    "You wanna start running again?" - Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) "US Marshals", a sequel to "The Fugitive", finds actor Tommy Lee Jones and his band of likable trackers hot on the trail of Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes), a man wrongly convicted of a crime. Jones has become a bit of an archetype, popping up in countless cat-and-mouse/predator-and-prey movies over the years. In films like "The Fugitive, "Men In Black", "The Hunted", "Three Burials", "US Marshals", "In The Valley of Elah", "The Missing", "In The Electric Mist" and "No Country For Old Men" (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. "US Marshalls" sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters ("Marshals" rightly recognises that the coolest characters in "The Fugitive" were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun. "US Marshal's" best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in "The French Connection", in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken. Seriously. Incidentally, Wesley Snipes would find himself becoming a fugitive on the run in real life, the FBI currently tracking him for tax evasion. The film also stars Irene Jacob. What's she doing here? See her in three masterpieces: Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red", "The Double Life of Veronique", and Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds". 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    This is literally the worst movie Jones has appeared in yet. That he could act in this civil rights garbage is dumbfounding. A very sad attempted redo of the great original movie starring Harrison Ford, The Fugitive. The movie is based on the premise that a black male (Smipes) would be wrongly accused by law enforcement of murder, perhaps a 1 in 500 million chance, usually they are doing a great job at being able to catch the many criminals, many of whom happen to be black. He is accused of murder, while in a hospital after a car accident. It also is very strange that they pair Snipes up with a recent White French immigrant woman, also unlikely and not something most would promote in an expensive studio feature movie.

    I was never much interested in watching this spin off of The Fugitive. What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive. Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie. You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max. Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc: we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man: hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys). Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

    This is the film that Robert Downey Jr said was "possibly the worst action movie of all time." I think he's wrong. He plays Special Agent Royce, against Wesley Snipes' Mark Sheridan and in the company of Tommy Lee Jones' Sam Gerard, who steals every scene he is in. Maybe Downey was a bit jealous. There's lots that is good about the film: the camera-work and the editing and the music, which is unobtrusive, as it should be. So credit to Andrjez Bartkowiak, who's been active since 1975, Terry Rawlings, who has been in films since 1957, and Jerry Goldsmith, who has been doing this stuff since 1954! Sometimes experience shows. Stuart Baird, in a rare outing as director also brings a wealth of experience in holding the whole thing together. The plot was too complex for me to take in on one viewing. This may be one of those films you need to see twice to piece things together. For me, I struggle a bit with Wesley Snipes. I know he has a big following but I just don't warm to him. His relationship with his girlfriend played by Irene Jacob, is unconvincing. It doesn't help that Jacob does not seem entirely comfortable with the English language, though she does look gorgeous. Overall, good film. Almost great. Worth a viewing.

    This is more of a spin-off than a sequel to The Fugitive because it focuses on Tommy Lee Jones' character and the U.S. Marshals which actually isn't a bad idea for a movie. It doesn't have what made The Fugitive good and to the people who say it brings nothing new to the action genre well, it's not supposed to. It's not meant to be groundbreaking it is just a popcorn flick that was meant to entertain and it works. It should have been a box office success, but it wasn't. Just like the first movie I thought it was a bit too long and could've been a bit shorter, but it's just a minor complaint. If you're looking for some cheap entertainment then this is a good choice.

    Capitalizing on the success that Tommy Lee Jones scored in The Fugitive, his character of Marshal Sam Gerard was given the lead in US Marshals where he is once again going after an innocent man. In this case Jones's target is Wesley Snipes who is not only an accused murderer of two agents, but he's accused of treason as well, passing secrets to the People's Republic of China. Tommy Lee Jones won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for The Fugitive, but he's not doing anything remotely reaching Oscar contention in US Marshals. It's a hastily and poorly written script with a lot of nice action sequences to cover that up. The airplane crash sequence where Snipes escapes from Jones's custody is well done as is his escape from an old age home on to the roof of a moving subway. As we know early on that Snipes is innocent, I'm here to tell you that the guilty party stands out like a sore thumb. A five year old child could tell you who the real bad guy and traitor is. Jones, Snipes and the rest of the cast do a workmanlike job. But this one is for easy to please action/adventure fans.

    What do you do when you release a movie and the co-star's character makes just as much of an impact on viewers as the main actor? Obviously you find a way to exploit the situation by coming up with another project to put that actor and character into. That's exactly what producers of "The Fugitive" did with Tommy Lee Jones' law enforcer, Sam Gerard. You shift the focus from the fugitive and place it on the men put in charge of catching him. They didn't want to veer too far off the beaten path, so you still have to have an innocent man running for his life and he has to have some type of star power. When "U.S. Marshals" came out in 1998, Wesley Snipes was a hot commodity and seemed like the perfect choice to play the role of the sympathetic man on the lamb. As an action film, this gets the job done. It does its best to be as good as "The Fugitive" but not get stuck trying to one-up it or be better. There's the obvious attempt at making the wreck in "U.S. Marshals" more of a spectacle by having the vehicle be an airplane instead of a passenger train. Besides that, it just seemed like director Stuart Baird wanted to make a good old fashioned crime caper with some mystery injected. Most viewers might be lost as to what the actual "item" causing all the trouble or the motivation for the whole movie is. All anyone really wants to know by the end of the film is if Snipes is innocent and, if so, who is guilty.

    This is the first time i have watched this movie and this movie has been out a long time. I loved The Fugitive and the whole Sam and Dr. Richard Kimble, cat and mouse. I was a little disappointed when i realised this was going to go down the same road but the plane crash was spectacular and kept me watching and wanting to see more. I am used to seeing Snipes as a villain so to see him as the running good guy didn't really cut it for me. Downey Junior didn't need to be on screen long before I figured it out he was the one that Sam needed to be after after all and he was actually the best character in this film. This disappointed me really though as if i could figure it out so quickly that he was the bad guy and believe me I am no miss Marple surely the great Deputy could have? But hey, all ends happily and Sam gets his man, unfortunately it does result in one of the regulars being a causality. Its worth an hour or two one Sunday afternoon when there is nothing else on but as for another film, thank goodness they realised Sam couldn't handle that.

    "You wanna start running again?" - Chief Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard (Tommy Lee Jones) "US Marshals", a sequel to "The Fugitive", finds actor Tommy Lee Jones and his band of likable trackers hot on the trail of Mark Roberts (Wesley Snipes), a man wrongly convicted of a crime. Jones has become a bit of an archetype, popping up in countless cat-and-mouse/predator-and-prey movies over the years. In films like "The Fugitive, "Men In Black", "The Hunted", "Three Burials", "US Marshals", "In The Valley of Elah", "The Missing", "In The Electric Mist" and "No Country For Old Men" (though there he is mockingly cast as an inept tracker), Jones plays a consummate blood-hound, a man bred for hot pursuit. He is typically without attachments, stern but witty, authoritative and forever determined to apprehend his prey. "US Marshalls" sticks to this formula, but some solid action sequences, a brisk pace, many one-liners and some likable side characters ("Marshals" rightly recognises that the coolest characters in "The Fugitive" were Tommy Lee Jones and his motor-mouthed gang) keeps things fun. "US Marshal's" best scene? A riff on Gene Hackman's Santa suit sequence in "The French Connection", in which Tommy Lee Jones conducts a pursuit and stakeout whilst dressed as a giant yellow chicken. Seriously. Incidentally, Wesley Snipes would find himself becoming a fugitive on the run in real life, the FBI currently tracking him for tax evasion. The film also stars Irene Jacob. What's she doing here? See her in three masterpieces: Kieslowski's "Three Colors: Red", "The Double Life of Veronique", and Antonioni's "Beyond the Clouds". 7.9/10  Worth one viewing.

    This is literally the worst movie Jones has appeared in yet. That he could act in this civil rights garbage is dumbfounding. A very sad attempted redo of the great original movie starring Harrison Ford, The Fugitive. The movie is based on the premise that a black male (Smipes) would be wrongly accused by law enforcement of murder, perhaps a 1 in 500 million chance, usually they are doing a great job at being able to catch the many criminals, many of whom happen to be black. He is accused of murder, while in a hospital after a car accident. It also is very strange that they pair Snipes up with a recent White French immigrant woman, also unlikely and not something most would promote in an expensive studio feature movie.

    I was never much interested in watching this spin off of The Fugitive. What attracted me to The Fugitive was Richard Kimble's story fleshed up by Harrison Ford and truckloads of action. Tommy Lee Jones as Sam Gerard stood out and was essential to the overall balance but you would not say that this supporting character was more interesting than the fugitive. Action packed as it is US Marshals lacks a deeper characterisation of Gerard. His team, his temper, his buoyancy, his tidy boss... these are nice touches but don't really build something more than the character we already saw in the previous movie. You can take the two impressive action sequences apart and they just look like another blockbuster's tour de force. In the course of the movie they are not set up as a tension peak, they mostly happen as scripted. Surely there are too many nice/interesting characters to follow (Tommy Lee Jones and 2-3 prominent members of his team, Robert Downey Jr, Wesley Snipes and his lover Ir&egrave;ne Jacob) so the editing rhythm is bogged down. The pace is simply not as fast as it should be for action to play to the max. Another big flaw is the 'New Fugitive' character arc: we don't know him from the get-go - whereas the premise of the original Fugitive was about an innocent man accused of his wife's murder and relentlessly tracked down - and then new elements are added that don't draw a clear picture of who he is - and if he is really innocent ! Most notably it is clear soon enough that he is not just your average man: hence empathy and rooting for him can never reach the required level for suspension of disbelief to work (I am especially thinking of the graveyard shooting, a sequence setup which looks blatantly haphazard for such big professional boys). Too bad they rushed such a script into production to poach on the Fugitive real-estate. They didn't need to have another nice innocent fugitive - especially given this protracted macguffin of a plot. Sam Gerard should have been the sole hero, attempting to stop more than a prisoner on the loose, and we should have had a better insight into the man's soul.

    Forgotten sequel to 'The Fugitive' that carefully excises any trace of excitement, tension, intrigue and Harrison Ford and replaces it with a reheated plot in which returning Oscar-winner Tommy Lee Jones is on the trail of Wesley Snipes, whose character has been set up by somebody for some reason over something that happened at some point. Snipes escapes custody in a scene that's oddly similar to the bus crash in the original film and then pegs it around for the next two hours while Jones and his team of marshals indulge in reams of mechanical banter and solve the conspiracy or whatever. Everything that's either obvious or pointless is explained in detail while all the confusing stuff is rattled out in rapid-fire chunks of dialogue that are hard to follow. Still, by the time the real culprit is revealed I was past caring.

    While not an awful movie, "US Marshals" feels a little bit derivative and worn out. It follows the grand footprints of it's technically better and more gripping older sibling, "The Fugitive". While Tommy Lee Jones sparkled and stole the show in the earlier film, he is the focus of this newer installment. His comic relief in Marshals becomes muted, and storyline is rehashed. Wesley Snipes co-stars as the newer "Fugitive" and much of the movie is by-the-numbers. The drama and mystery is easily guessed unfortunately. The music too is tedious. However you could do a lot worse with Jones keeping many scenes afloat and in-command. Maybe worthwhile if you like Jones. Robert Downey Jr. has a lower profile role especially compared to newer movies we've seen him in. 6/10
