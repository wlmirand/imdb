    His voice you haven't imagined, his Argentinean accent spent most of his life in Paris, also he seems to have some kind of speech impediment . He makes fun of himself when he used to translate live for the radio and no one would understand. The parts of the movie that show Cortazar's home in Paris, his tape recorder, his walks around the neighborhood add a lot of warm to the film. There's footage of Julio Cortazar talking about his life story. Plus you get to hear his stories read, and illustrated through the magic of film. He used to tape them to correct them, so some excerpts narrated by him. You learn about this great man and his writing process, and get parts of his literature. There's also the political inclinations of the period, he became very involved with many Latin American revolutionary movements. For me this is where the films fails by paying too much attention. But you also get to learn of how the Latin American literature boom came about. I found it illuminating and warm.

    More a documentary than a movie actually, "Cortazar" portraits beautifully the life and poetry of this marvelous Argentinean writer.It's a warm hommage with both interesting data (Julio's voice and interviews) and beautiful images based on his writing.A must see for any lover of the good literature.
