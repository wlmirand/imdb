    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

    One of the most intelligent religion movies i've ever seen. Walken did great acting, so did others, no stupid voice-changes like in some exorcism stuff... But yes really good script and all. I'm not religious dude but I like watching some movies like this style. Viggo Mortensen seemed like a child abuser at one point but wasn't .. I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

    A rambunctious Movie with a lot of appeal and a very wide stellar cast not usually seen in this type of semi-low-budget affair. It is quite a clever and remarkable effort that has a swirling pace and is never boring. The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

    "The Prophecy", by its story alone, is an unforgettably provocative tale of angels & arrogance. In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

    "The Prophecy", by its story alone, is an unforgettably provocative tale of angels & arrogance. In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

    One of the most intelligent religion movies i've ever seen. Walken did great acting, so did others, no stupid voice-changes like in some exorcism stuff... But yes really good script and all. I'm not religious dude but I like watching some movies like this style. Viggo Mortensen seemed like a child abuser at one point but wasn't .. I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

    One of the most intelligent religion movies i've ever seen. Walken did great acting, so did others, no stupid voice-changes like in some exorcism stuff... But yes really good script and all. I'm not religious dude but I like watching some movies like this style. Viggo Mortensen seemed like a child abuser at one point but wasn't .. I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

    A rambunctious Movie with a lot of appeal and a very wide stellar cast not usually seen in this type of semi-low-budget affair. It is quite a clever and remarkable effort that has a swirling pace and is never boring. The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

    "The Prophecy", by its story alone, is an unforgettably provocative tale of angels & arrogance. In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

    One of the most intelligent religion movies i've ever seen. Walken did great acting, so did others, no stupid voice-changes like in some exorcism stuff... But yes really good script and all. I'm not religious dude but I like watching some movies like this style. Viggo Mortensen seemed like a child abuser at one point but wasn't .. I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

    A rambunctious Movie with a lot of appeal and a very wide stellar cast not usually seen in this type of semi-low-budget affair. It is quite a clever and remarkable effort that has a swirling pace and is never boring. The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

    "The Prophecy", by its story alone, is an unforgettably provocative tale of angels & arrogance. In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned.

In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !

    One of the most intelligent religion movies i've ever seen. Walken did great acting, so did others, no stupid voice-changes like in some exorcism stuff... But yes really good script and all. I'm not religious dude but I like watching some movies like this style. Viggo Mortensen seemed like a child abuser at one point but wasn't .. I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

    A rambunctious Movie with a lot of appeal and a very wide stellar cast not usually seen in this type of semi-low-budget affair. It is quite a clever and remarkable effort that has a swirling pace and is never boring. The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

I think, great acting anyway (why the fuc**ng hell he always gets this types of roles). Only minus for me was this length and it wasn't truly any kinda of horror for me. Anyway brilliant for the genre, something new, even this is so old and I missed just seen this. Worth to watch for movie PPL who like this kind of movies. No spooky stuff anywhere I think and great story. Lot more interesting than many others with angel-thingy. 9/10

    A rambunctious Movie with a lot of appeal and a very wide stellar cast not usually seen in this type of semi-low-budget affair. It is quite a clever and remarkable effort that has a swirling pace and is never boring. The dense plot sometimes gets in the way of this entertaining entry in the Horror/Supernatural genre but the performances and the witty script help elevate the overall brazen, if sometimes soggy story. There is some striking and unsettling imagery and the Cinematography is excellent. It has a strong creepiness factor and the rather successful effect of the whole Film is tethered to an unforgettable, black-humored performance from Chris Walken as Gabriel. Most of the films quotable lines come from his striking study of a powerful and befuddled Angel. This is an offbeat Movie that gains reputation with each passing year, having been mostly ignored upon release. A true Cult Movie that has grown in stature by word of mouth and rabid fans of crazy concepts and intelligent execution. If the Film has a strong weakness it is the ending that seems a little too Hollywood and little too hokey. But up until the final scene or two, this is one of those that has been misunderstood and overlooked. The sequels are not in the same league as this gem and can be avoided without penance.

    THE PROPHECY, the first in a series of films about fallen angels warring on Earth, is a hoot. It features some truly zany scenes, usually involving 'good' angel Eric Stoltz fighting against the forces of evil, and a stand-out performance from Christopher Walken who toplines as the angel Gabriel. Walken is one weird guy, and he's never been weirder than in this film. Writer/director Gregory Widen gives Walken some great dialogue to play with, which adds immeasurably to the fun. The storyline is all over the place really, mixing in some police procedural stuff with De Niro-lookalike cop Elias Koteas, a cameo for Lucifer himself (Viggo Mortensen, raising his profile) and a superfluous appearance for CANDYMAN's Virginia Madsen. Despite the film's sometimes slightly aimless feel, for the most part it works. The storyline is punctuated by moments of creepiness and graphic violence and for the most part it feels fresh and original. In fact, it did so well that sequels followed...

    "The Prophecy", by its story alone, is an unforgettably provocative tale of angels & arrogance. In a nutshell, it presents the idea of a "second war in heaven" which is all about... you guessed it... us humans. I'm not sure of its religious accuracy, but from a general mythological standpoint, it's entirely believable... like straight out of the pages of Homer. Beyond that I won't say anything because it's best to figure it out for yourself as the movie progresses. If this film were made with a bunch of forgettable actors, it would still be highly enjoyable. Like I said, the story is compelling, the suspense is thick, the soundtrack is cool, and the cinematography is majestic. But what makes this film positively PRICELESS is the all-star cast that breathe life, quirkiness and comedy into the flick. I'm not just talking about the incomparable Christopher Walken (whom we'll get to later) but also other veterans from Pulp Fiction made the year before: Eric Stoltz (Lance in Pulp Fiction, Simon in The Prophecy), Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny in PF, Rachel in Prophecy). Then there's Steve Hytner whom you might recognize as the lovably annoying Kenny Bania on Seinfeld ("That's GOLD Jerry, GOLD!"). And in his best role ever, there's Adam Goldberg (Chandler's psycho roommate on Friends) playing the role of Christopher Walken's suicidally-depressed, oozing sidekick "Jerry". The entire film "The Prophecy" is like a who's who of the 1990s. And of course there's Viggo Mortensen (Aragorn from Lord of the Rings) who does a suave version of Lucifer. Seriously, these people didn't even need a script, they could've just sat in a room talking about sweet potato pie and it would be awesome. OK, back to Chris Walken. Simply HIS BEST ROLE EVER! I've seen him in everything from "Deer Hunter" to "Dead Zone" to "Puss in Boots" to "Wedding Crashers", and I tell you he was born to play this role of Gabriel the Angel of Death. In his performance he brings that sinister Walken charm combined with flat-out riotous comedy and even spots of childhood innocence as only he can do (who would've guessed Archangel Gabriel can't drive a car). Walken carries us not only through this film but also through the two sequels with impeccable style. I mentioned how great the cast is, how great the story is, and how great the cinematography is, but really Christopher Walken was all it took to make me a believer. So don't hesitate to see this movie. I remember watching it in theaters when it first came out... it blew the audience away. And now 17 years later it's even better. What's great about this film is that each character is so freakin cool you gotta love each one, whether they're good or evil. The 1990s was THE DECADE for religious thrillers. After you watch The Prophecy, don't miss "Exorcist III" which has the same gritty vibe with spots of brilliant humor. Other films I'd compare this to are "The Usual Suspects" and another excellent Walken flick "Suicide Kings".

    While trying to discover the identity of a mysterious corpse, former priest turned policeman Thomas Dagget (Elias Koteas) learns of a war raging in heaven, angel Gabriel (Christopher Walken) leading an army of rebels who are jealous of the favour God has shown towards man. For a film about warring angels, The Prophecy is surprisingly devoid of spectacle, with very little in the way of battles between winged beings and a hugely disappointing climax; thank heavens, then, for the great cast, who somehow make this biblical nonsense pretty entertaining. Walken as Gabriel is the film's strongest suit, giving a quirky performance that adds a touch of humour to the otherwise rather sober proceedings; Virginia Madsen, as a schoolteacher caught in the middle of the war, is simply gorgeous, adding the glamour factor; Viggo Mortensen makes for a surprisingly creepy Lucifer; and Eric Stoltz delivers a solid performance as good angel Simon. Amanda Plummer and Adam Goldberg are also good, but their roles add little to the movie as a whole. All in all, The Prophecy is a reasonably decent piece of religious horror, albeit not a particularly memorable one.

    Are you saying we have a dead angel on ice? Saw this without any knowledge, but saw the cast, Christopher Walken, Viggo Mortensen and Eric Stolz, which I all admire for their work, and was immediately quite amazed by the tone and excitement. This is dark, compelling, chilling and quite shocking. I would say that most things work. It's so damned we'll played by all, not only the above mentioned. Maybe this is both Walken and Stolz best roles ever! Walken is simply astonishing chilling in his role as arch angel. An absolute must-see! We meet a cop, which formerly tried to become a priest, but fail at the final blessing. After giving up religion, and becoming a detective, he has an encounter with might be an angel. And then what also seems to be an angel, according to ancient scripts, also is an angel, dead after a violent fight. Are we seeing a war of angels? Based on old biblical writings this is way more exciting than any of Dan Brown's stuff. Don't let this mislead you into thinking this is something rubbish. It's scary and worst of all quite believable. Kept in a realistic everyday style, it still gives chill after chill in meeting with the angels, among them the great arch angel Gabriel. I also love the make up effects made for this film. Nasty, well done stuff. Filming is great. Just like some of the best films I saw back in the 70'ies, 80'ies and 90'ies. The feel I get the same good movie feeling I had a long time ago, and reminds me of the classics like "The Exorcist", "Rosemary's baby", "Name of the rose", which all are themed similarly or the dark filming work of "Deliverance", "Whatever happened to Baby-Jane", "Duel" and "The Marathon man". Yeah, it's really that good, and that well done, but even darker! If you liked the chills in those, you'll like this. It's good story telling, which makes this a hidden classic. Maybe the end is too abrupt and positive. The weakest part is the final minutes, but then again this is a story that needs such an ending. The music score is out of this world. Not only this. The dialog is exquisite and the quotes you can get from this are epic. Do yourself a favor, if you haven't seen this! Get hold of it! I just discovered a hidden gem!

    A second war in heaven has broken out with the archangel "Gabriel" (Christopher Walken) leading a rebellion against God in an attempt to pressure him into renouncing the human race. To that end, Gabriel desperately needs the "dark soul" to help break the stalemate between his army and that of the archangel Michael. With that in mind, "Thomas Dagget" (Elias Koteas) has been studying to become a priest but because of disturbing visions renounces his calling at the last minute and ends up as a police detective instead. As luck would have it, he and an elementary school teacher named "Katherine" (Virginia Madsen) are thrown into the war of the angels as they seek to protect a young girl named "Mary" (Moriah Snyder) who unwittingly harbors the "dark soul". Anyway, what transpires is a bizarre hide-and-seek story with all sorts of Biblical names and references (of questionable origin) thrown in. For example, Thomas relates that he is disturbed by a Biblical passage in which St. Paul states, "Even now in heaven there were angels carrying savage weapons." And he should be disturbedbecause there is no such quote in the Bible. Fortunately, his bewilderment is dissipated after he stumbles upon a book containing the 23rd chapter of the Book of Revelation which pretty much explains everything. As it should, obviously, since Revelation normally ends at chapter 22. Naturally, there are other angels and angles thrown in as well. In any case, both Elias Koteas and Christopher Walken put on excellent performances and there were some decent action scenes thrown in for good measure. Be that as it may, even the best acting can't make up for the extremely ludicrous pseudo-religious drivel the story is based upon. Quite embarrassing, actually. As such, I feel compelled to rate it accordingly.

    This is my first IMDb movie review so bare with me! I had very high hopes for this film as two of my favourite actors (Christopher Walken and Viggo Mortensen) star in it and also because even though I am an atheist, I enjoy movies with a religious context to them especially if they are of the horror or thriller genre. By the synopsis, this film sounded okay, nothing great but nothing terrible. The film starts off slow and I kept waiting for it to pick up but it never did. It fell flat on every scene. I was bored rigid watching it which isn't like me watching a film. I can usually find something riveting while watching a movie. The actors done their best with a weak script but it wasn't enough to make this movie entertaining. I'm usually quite generous with films. I know that most of the films I watch will never be amazing or memorable, they will be average and passable. Sadly, this one doesn't even cut to average. I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone unless its on the TV one day and you have nothing to watch while you sit and text your friends and don't actually pay attention to what its on the TV, you just have it on in the background.

    Thomas Dagget is an LA detective with a deeply Catholic background who is brought in to investigate when a dead John Doe turns up with an ancient Bible in his pocket. Things get stranger when a mysterious figure called Gabriel appears, and the trail leads to a little girl called Mary living in rural Arizona. What in Heaven's name is going on ? This is a great little scary movie, a production from the always interesting Dimension Films company, brilliantly written and directed by Widen with wit, originality and loads of good ideas. Okay, it may be more than a little crazy, but who cares - it's so interesting, great fun and an almost perfect balance of religious parable, goofy comedy and action mystery. The depiction of the angels in particular is spectacular; their bird-like perching, olfactory capabilities and curious limitations (they can't drive) are both intriguing and funny. Walken takes these ideas and runs with them, turning in an amazing, unforgettable performance, but the whole cast really get into it, and Koteas as the Doubting Thomas investigator somehow manages to make sense of the increasingly bizarre events. The film has some low budget limitations - the effects are imaginative but struggle to convey the scale of the story - but it has so much going for it it doesn't matter. If you think about it, angels almost always make for good cinema, whether it's A Matter Of Life And Death, It's A Wonderful Life, Wings Of Desire, The Crow, Dogma, even Michael or City Of Angels - I can't think of a boring movie about angels. Theological ideas often come over well in films, whether it's because of special effects or character contrast I'm not sure, but they are endlessly fascinating figures and this film particularly paints them in a wholly unique light. Just to be complicated, this movie has spawned four direct sequels (the first two of which also feature Walken) and should not be confused with the (bad, but fun) 1979 John Frankenheimer movie Prophecy. Unfortunately, this is Widen's only directorial effort; a shame given how much talent he obviously has - he also wrote Highlander (great story) and Backdraft (rubbish story). We live in a religiously dynamic and diverse world, yet the concepts rarely find their way into mainstream cinema. Horror movies on the other hand have a long, rich and continuous thirst for matters Divine, and this is one of the best and most enjoyable such pictures. A great film from Widen, shot in evocative desert locations in Gila County, Arizona. And remember kids - study your maths !
