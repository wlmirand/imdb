    So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.

    Honestly, how is this film NOT on The IMDb Top 250?! This movie reached just as many of my own expectations that Citizen Kane, Gandhi, and Casablanca ever did! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed these movies, but 101 Dalmatians: The Live Action Version is one of the most underrated films that I have seen in years! The story line may have felt quite predictable, especially if you have seen the equally brilliant original from 1961, but it's the performances that really moved me from my sofa, cheering! Glenn Close's performance as Cruella DeVil was both hilarious, and brought the evilness of the character she was playing as one of the most though-provoking villains on screen! The slapstick with Jasper and Horrace gave this film a "Home Alone" theme towards it, which; in my opinion, worked really well, and the music fitted the mood of the film perfectly! I loved the animals, especially the dalmatians; who were adorable! Ignore any rotten reviews, this very heartwarming, and cute little movie is a must see! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s. Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points. The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil. The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise. The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish. The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive. If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor. 4/10

    It has been many years indeed since I watched the animated version of this film - in fact, I can't remember watching it all the way through. The thing that Disney do best of all is conjuring up heart-warming tales that only have a loose connection to reality and this is no different. However, I can't help thinking that this has been rather harshly scored on this website. It may be the lovechild of "Home Alone" and "Babe" but despite the excessively kiddie-friendly approach, this remains a surprisingly enjoyable film that doesn't deserve its low score. In a Disneyfied version of London, American video game designer Roger (Jeff Daniels) literally runs into fellow Dalmatian owner Anita (Joely Richardson) after their respective dogs fall in love at first sight. As Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdita (their dogs) are ahead of them when they soon have a litter of 15 puppies. While they welcome the new arrivals, the news is music to the ears of the villainous Cruella De Vil (an electrified Glenn Close) who plans to use the puppies to make a new coat for herself. Trouble is, the plan to snatch the puppies relies on her two goons Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and they aren't exactly blessed in the intelligence department. If you take the cute animals from "Babe" and the madcap slapstick finale from "Home Alone" then you've pretty much got "101 Dalmatians" wrapped up. Thankfully, there is more to recommend than just people falling over into mucky stuff and the biggest of these is Close as Cruella. It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild! But despite the little oddities, this remains an enjoyable family film that deserves to be considered. By aiming for a family market, "101 Dalmatians" never tries to be anything other than simple fun. And do you know what - that's exactly what it is. But it never feels anything other than synthetic, sanitised entertainment and although that's what you expect from Disney, I can't help wishing that it could push itself a little further. If it's set in London with a largely British cast, why did it need Disney's interference and gloss smothering everything? It doesn't make it a complete dog's dinner but I can't help wishing they'd let sleeping dogs lie.

    First there is the animated 101 Dalmations, which I love. But then there is this one, the live-action one, which I don't like. This is not terrible, it's just rather boring and a little painful to watch. This movie is rather lame and it induces more groans than laughs. I rarely laughed throughout the course of this movie, in fact, I rarely even smiled. 101 Dalmations somewhat corrupts the meaning of the animated original, especially in the humor department. Whereas the original animated movie had great humor for the entire family, this one is reduced from family humor to childish humor. I like childish humor, but not a movie that is strictly childish humor. A movie needs to have a type of humor that is not for just children, it needs to have a type of humor that is for everybody, not for just one type of person. All in all, this movie is not one of the worst movies ever made, but I just didn't like it, it was too childish and silly for me. I probably would have like it better if the humor would have been more appropriate for somebody like me. Another thing I didn't like about this was the fact that they based this live-action movie on an animated feature film from the 1960's. I have nothing against live-action movies based on cartoons being made, but this was not a good idea. This production wasn't a good idea, it didn't even sound like a good idea. Making live-action movies based on cartoons usually isn't a good idea, it just doesn't seem to work. This movie is proof of that. Kids nowadays are looking for a movie with likable characters and very good humor. This film has neither of those, having lost in its live-action making what the animated original did so right. In short, this movie is boring and unfunny, it is not even that entertaining for children. Adults will probably find it boring just like I did, children may like it, especially very small children. Anyone else? No. 101 Dalmations is not a terrible movie, it is just boring, unoriginal, unfunny, and just plain forgettable. I'll repeat what I said in the above paragraphs, this lame live-action adaption induces more groans than laughs. Do yourself a favor and rent the animated original instead. 4/10

    I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.

    Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter. 101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot. Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest. Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other. The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines. Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak. Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff. In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!

    I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why. 101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella. I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat. Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.

    So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed. This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors. Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary. The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable. This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid. The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.

    This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt. Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back. Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing. It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original. Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie. Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars

It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild! But despite the little oddities, this remains an enjoyable family film that deserves to be considered. By aiming for a family market, "101 Dalmatians" never tries to be anything other than simple fun. And do you know what - that's exactly what it is. But it never feels anything other than synthetic, sanitised entertainment and although that's what you expect from Disney, I can't help wishing that it could push itself a little further. If it's set in London with a largely British cast, why did it need Disney's interference and gloss smothering everything? It doesn't make it a complete dog's dinner but I can't help wishing they'd let sleeping dogs lie.

    First there is the animated 101 Dalmations, which I love. But then there is this one, the live-action one, which I don't like. This is not terrible, it's just rather boring and a little painful to watch. This movie is rather lame and it induces more groans than laughs. I rarely laughed throughout the course of this movie, in fact, I rarely even smiled. 101 Dalmations somewhat corrupts the meaning of the animated original, especially in the humor department. Whereas the original animated movie had great humor for the entire family, this one is reduced from family humor to childish humor. I like childish humor, but not a movie that is strictly childish humor. A movie needs to have a type of humor that is not for just children, it needs to have a type of humor that is for everybody, not for just one type of person. All in all, this movie is not one of the worst movies ever made, but I just didn't like it, it was too childish and silly for me. I probably would have like it better if the humor would have been more appropriate for somebody like me. Another thing I didn't like about this was the fact that they based this live-action movie on an animated feature film from the 1960's. I have nothing against live-action movies based on cartoons being made, but this was not a good idea. This production wasn't a good idea, it didn't even sound like a good idea. Making live-action movies based on cartoons usually isn't a good idea, it just doesn't seem to work. This movie is proof of that. Kids nowadays are looking for a movie with likable characters and very good humor. This film has neither of those, having lost in its live-action making what the animated original did so right. In short, this movie is boring and unfunny, it is not even that entertaining for children. Adults will probably find it boring just like I did, children may like it, especially very small children. Anyone else? No. 101 Dalmations is not a terrible movie, it is just boring, unoriginal, unfunny, and just plain forgettable. I'll repeat what I said in the above paragraphs, this lame live-action adaption induces more groans than laughs. Do yourself a favor and rent the animated original instead. 4/10

    I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.

    Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter. 101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot. Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest. Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other. The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines. Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak. Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff. In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!

    I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why. 101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella. I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat. Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.

    So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed. This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors. Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary. The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable. This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid. The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.

    This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt. Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back. Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing. It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original. Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie. Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars

    So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.

    Honestly, how is this film NOT on The IMDb Top 250?! This movie reached just as many of my own expectations that Citizen Kane, Gandhi, and Casablanca ever did! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed these movies, but 101 Dalmatians: The Live Action Version is one of the most underrated films that I have seen in years! The story line may have felt quite predictable, especially if you have seen the equally brilliant original from 1961, but it's the performances that really moved me from my sofa, cheering! Glenn Close's performance as Cruella DeVil was both hilarious, and brought the evilness of the character she was playing as one of the most though-provoking villains on screen! The slapstick with Jasper and Horrace gave this film a "Home Alone" theme towards it, which; in my opinion, worked really well, and the music fitted the mood of the film perfectly! I loved the animals, especially the dalmatians; who were adorable! Ignore any rotten reviews, this very heartwarming, and cute little movie is a must see! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s. Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points. The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil. The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise. The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish. The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive. If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor. 4/10

    It has been many years indeed since I watched the animated version of this film - in fact, I can't remember watching it all the way through. The thing that Disney do best of all is conjuring up heart-warming tales that only have a loose connection to reality and this is no different. However, I can't help thinking that this has been rather harshly scored on this website. It may be the lovechild of "Home Alone" and "Babe" but despite the excessively kiddie-friendly approach, this remains a surprisingly enjoyable film that doesn't deserve its low score. In a Disneyfied version of London, American video game designer Roger (Jeff Daniels) literally runs into fellow Dalmatian owner Anita (Joely Richardson) after their respective dogs fall in love at first sight. As Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdita (their dogs) are ahead of them when they soon have a litter of 15 puppies. While they welcome the new arrivals, the news is music to the ears of the villainous Cruella De Vil (an electrified Glenn Close) who plans to use the puppies to make a new coat for herself. Trouble is, the plan to snatch the puppies relies on her two goons Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and they aren't exactly blessed in the intelligence department. If you take the cute animals from "Babe" and the madcap slapstick finale from "Home Alone" then you've pretty much got "101 Dalmatians" wrapped up. Thankfully, there is more to recommend than just people falling over into mucky stuff and the biggest of these is Close as Cruella. It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild!

    I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why. 101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella. I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat. Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.

    So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed. This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors. Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary. The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable. This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid. The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.

    This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt. Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back. Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing. It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original. Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie. Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars

    So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.

    Honestly, how is this film NOT on The IMDb Top 250?! This movie reached just as many of my own expectations that Citizen Kane, Gandhi, and Casablanca ever did! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed these movies, but 101 Dalmatians: The Live Action Version is one of the most underrated films that I have seen in years! The story line may have felt quite predictable, especially if you have seen the equally brilliant original from 1961, but it's the performances that really moved me from my sofa, cheering! Glenn Close's performance as Cruella DeVil was both hilarious, and brought the evilness of the character she was playing as one of the most though-provoking villains on screen! The slapstick with Jasper and Horrace gave this film a "Home Alone" theme towards it, which; in my opinion, worked really well, and the music fitted the mood of the film perfectly! I loved the animals, especially the dalmatians; who were adorable! Ignore any rotten reviews, this very heartwarming, and cute little movie is a must see! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s. Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points. The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil. The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise. The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish. The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive. If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor. 4/10

    It has been many years indeed since I watched the animated version of this film - in fact, I can't remember watching it all the way through. The thing that Disney do best of all is conjuring up heart-warming tales that only have a loose connection to reality and this is no different. However, I can't help thinking that this has been rather harshly scored on this website. It may be the lovechild of "Home Alone" and "Babe" but despite the excessively kiddie-friendly approach, this remains a surprisingly enjoyable film that doesn't deserve its low score. In a Disneyfied version of London, American video game designer Roger (Jeff Daniels) literally runs into fellow Dalmatian owner Anita (Joely Richardson) after their respective dogs fall in love at first sight. As Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdita (their dogs) are ahead of them when they soon have a litter of 15 puppies. While they welcome the new arrivals, the news is music to the ears of the villainous Cruella De Vil (an electrified Glenn Close) who plans to use the puppies to make a new coat for herself. Trouble is, the plan to snatch the puppies relies on her two goons Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and they aren't exactly blessed in the intelligence department. If you take the cute animals from "Babe" and the madcap slapstick finale from "Home Alone" then you've pretty much got "101 Dalmatians" wrapped up. Thankfully, there is more to recommend than just people falling over into mucky stuff and the biggest of these is Close as Cruella. It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild! But despite the little oddities, this remains an enjoyable family film that deserves to be considered. By aiming for a family market, "101 Dalmatians" never tries to be anything other than simple fun. And do you know what - that's exactly what it is. But it never feels anything other than synthetic, sanitised entertainment and although that's what you expect from Disney, I can't help wishing that it could push itself a little further. If it's set in London with a largely British cast, why did it need Disney's interference and gloss smothering everything? It doesn't make it a complete dog's dinner but I can't help wishing they'd let sleeping dogs lie.

    First there is the animated 101 Dalmations, which I love. But then there is this one, the live-action one, which I don't like. This is not terrible, it's just rather boring and a little painful to watch. This movie is rather lame and it induces more groans than laughs. I rarely laughed throughout the course of this movie, in fact, I rarely even smiled. 101 Dalmations somewhat corrupts the meaning of the animated original, especially in the humor department. Whereas the original animated movie had great humor for the entire family, this one is reduced from family humor to childish humor. I like childish humor, but not a movie that is strictly childish humor. A movie needs to have a type of humor that is not for just children, it needs to have a type of humor that is for everybody, not for just one type of person. All in all, this movie is not one of the worst movies ever made, but I just didn't like it, it was too childish and silly for me. I probably would have like it better if the humor would have been more appropriate for somebody like me. Another thing I didn't like about this was the fact that they based this live-action movie on an animated feature film from the 1960's. I have nothing against live-action movies based on cartoons being made, but this was not a good idea. This production wasn't a good idea, it didn't even sound like a good idea. Making live-action movies based on cartoons usually isn't a good idea, it just doesn't seem to work. This movie is proof of that. Kids nowadays are looking for a movie with likable characters and very good humor. This film has neither of those, having lost in its live-action making what the animated original did so right. In short, this movie is boring and unfunny, it is not even that entertaining for children. Adults will probably find it boring just like I did, children may like it, especially very small children. Anyone else? No. 101 Dalmations is not a terrible movie, it is just boring, unoriginal, unfunny, and just plain forgettable. I'll repeat what I said in the above paragraphs, this lame live-action adaption induces more groans than laughs. Do yourself a favor and rent the animated original instead. 4/10

    I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.

    Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter. 101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot. Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest. Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other. The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines. Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak. Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff. In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!

Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil. The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise. The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish. The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive. If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor. 4/10

    It has been many years indeed since I watched the animated version of this film - in fact, I can't remember watching it all the way through. The thing that Disney do best of all is conjuring up heart-warming tales that only have a loose connection to reality and this is no different. However, I can't help thinking that this has been rather harshly scored on this website. It may be the lovechild of "Home Alone" and "Babe" but despite the excessively kiddie-friendly approach, this remains a surprisingly enjoyable film that doesn't deserve its low score. In a Disneyfied version of London, American video game designer Roger (Jeff Daniels) literally runs into fellow Dalmatian owner Anita (Joely Richardson) after their respective dogs fall in love at first sight. As Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdita (their dogs) are ahead of them when they soon have a litter of 15 puppies. While they welcome the new arrivals, the news is music to the ears of the villainous Cruella De Vil (an electrified Glenn Close) who plans to use the puppies to make a new coat for herself. Trouble is, the plan to snatch the puppies relies on her two goons Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and they aren't exactly blessed in the intelligence department. If you take the cute animals from "Babe" and the madcap slapstick finale from "Home Alone" then you've pretty much got "101 Dalmatians" wrapped up. Thankfully, there is more to recommend than just people falling over into mucky stuff and the biggest of these is Close as Cruella. It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild! But despite the little oddities, this remains an enjoyable family film that deserves to be considered. By aiming for a family market, "101 Dalmatians" never tries to be anything other than simple fun. And do you know what - that's exactly what it is. But it never feels anything other than synthetic, sanitised entertainment and although that's what you expect from Disney, I can't help wishing that it could push itself a little further. If it's set in London with a largely British cast, why did it need Disney's interference and gloss smothering everything? It doesn't make it a complete dog's dinner but I can't help wishing they'd let sleeping dogs lie.

    First there is the animated 101 Dalmations, which I love. But then there is this one, the live-action one, which I don't like. This is not terrible, it's just rather boring and a little painful to watch. This movie is rather lame and it induces more groans than laughs. I rarely laughed throughout the course of this movie, in fact, I rarely even smiled. 101 Dalmations somewhat corrupts the meaning of the animated original, especially in the humor department. Whereas the original animated movie had great humor for the entire family, this one is reduced from family humor to childish humor. I like childish humor, but not a movie that is strictly childish humor. A movie needs to have a type of humor that is not for just children, it needs to have a type of humor that is for everybody, not for just one type of person. All in all, this movie is not one of the worst movies ever made, but I just didn't like it, it was too childish and silly for me. I probably would have like it better if the humor would have been more appropriate for somebody like me. Another thing I didn't like about this was the fact that they based this live-action movie on an animated feature film from the 1960's. I have nothing against live-action movies based on cartoons being made, but this was not a good idea. This production wasn't a good idea, it didn't even sound like a good idea. Making live-action movies based on cartoons usually isn't a good idea, it just doesn't seem to work. This movie is proof of that. Kids nowadays are looking for a movie with likable characters and very good humor. This film has neither of those, having lost in its live-action making what the animated original did so right. In short, this movie is boring and unfunny, it is not even that entertaining for children. Adults will probably find it boring just like I did, children may like it, especially very small children. Anyone else? No. 101 Dalmations is not a terrible movie, it is just boring, unoriginal, unfunny, and just plain forgettable. I'll repeat what I said in the above paragraphs, this lame live-action adaption induces more groans than laughs. Do yourself a favor and rent the animated original instead. 4/10

    I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.

    Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter. 101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart. This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot. Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest. Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other. The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines. Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak. Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff. In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!

    I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why. 101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella. I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat. Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.

    So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed. This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors. Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary. The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable. This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid. The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.

    This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt. Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back. Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing. It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original. Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie. Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars

    So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.

    Honestly, how is this film NOT on The IMDb Top 250?! This movie reached just as many of my own expectations that Citizen Kane, Gandhi, and Casablanca ever did! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed these movies, but 101 Dalmatians: The Live Action Version is one of the most underrated films that I have seen in years! The story line may have felt quite predictable, especially if you have seen the equally brilliant original from 1961, but it's the performances that really moved me from my sofa, cheering! Glenn Close's performance as Cruella DeVil was both hilarious, and brought the evilness of the character she was playing as one of the most though-provoking villains on screen! The slapstick with Jasper and Horrace gave this film a "Home Alone" theme towards it, which; in my opinion, worked really well, and the music fitted the mood of the film perfectly! I loved the animals, especially the dalmatians; who were adorable! Ignore any rotten reviews, this very heartwarming, and cute little movie is a must see! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

This Stephen Herek-directed movie "updates" the formula and adds a couple of dumb chase sequences to fill time, giving us characters that we don't care about and putting them in situations that cheerlessly mangle the original plot. Roger Dearly (Jeff Daniels) is a video game designer. He's an obvious update on the song-writing Roger out of the animated version and this proves problematic right away: there's no excuse for the famous and awesome Cruella de Vil song. In any event, Roger has a dog genius named Pongo. Pongo's pretty bright, but we have no idea what's going on in his canine head because there's no internal dog monologue. The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have. You know the rest. Stunningly, this live action version of Dodie Smith's story was penned and produced by John Hughes. Yes, that John Hughes. How he managed to mangle such a simple story is beyond me, but he sure did a number on this one. For starters, this version sticks the humans squarely in charge of things and then jettisons them for the last act so that we get a musically driven dog's rescue sequence that eliminates the brilliance of the original because we can't hear what they're saying to each other. The best parts of the animated version are, therefore, gone. The barking of the dogs becomes a bunch of noise and the overwhelmingly invasive Michael Kamen score keeps meddling and telling us what we're supposed to feel. As much as I dislike the premise of talking animal movies, Disney's remake could have used a voice or two from the kingdom of the canines. Because the dogs lack voices and because we're focused on the dumb, boring humans, we don't really ever connect when the dogs go missing. The sequences that the animated version used to so lovingly attach us to Pongo and his family are gone, replaced by a grand "naming of the dogs" sequence that really only identifies the dogs by physical traits. This is another problem that could have been solved by having the dogs speak. Of course, having animals speak in these sorts of movies usually suffers from the fact that talking animals generally look stupid. But Disney doesn't seem to have any concern of that because they use copious CGI anyway, "fleshing out" the actions of the dogs and other animals when the trained canines can't do the trick. The discrepancy here is abundantly and embarrassingly clear, as it's hard to mask the sudden appearance of a CGI puppy heading down a slide into the snow. The large group shots of the puppies also shine with the clumsy computer-assisted stuff. In the end, 101 Dalmatians is a waste of time. While some may find value in the Glenn Close performance and some of the animal stuff, it wasn't enough for me. The movie is amazingly lazy, even by Disney's modern standards. The invasive score, the poor CGI and the bland performances from Daniels and Richardson make this a film to avoid like a creepy canine with rabies. And don't even get me started on the tragic absence of the beloved Sergeant Tibbs!

    I have seen this so many times on TV and every time its on I have to watch it again and here is why. 101 Dalmatians is a live action Disney movie based on the animated version. The movie is about two Dalmatians who meet in a park along with their owners who both fall for each other and they have 15 puppies. Anita(Joey Richardson) is a fashion designer who works for the evil Cruella De Vil(played by the brilliant Glenn Close who is sporting a Sharon Osbourne do)steals Anita's puppies along with other Dalmatian puppies to make a spotted coat. She hires two dim-witted burglars who helps her get the puppies with hilarious cauos along the way with the other animals that save the puppies from the evil Cruella. I liked this film as it was cute and adorable how we see two Dalmatians falling in love even though they have different owners(Jeff Daniels from the hilarious Dumb & Dumber flick and the late Natasha Richardson's sister Joey Richardson who play the owners who decide to marry so that there dogs could be together). Its kinda hard to explain this film as its all about animals been kidnapped by an evil woman who wants to make a Dalmatian coat. Anyway if you like animals then check it out. Its a really nice film as well as a very funny one too.

    So I settled down on a Sunday evening to what should have been a pleasant Disney film. Boy, was I disappointed. This live action version takes the basic elements of the original, but strips out all the charm. There's no cat. There's no scene where the puppies disguise themselves as labradors. Cruella is a mean business woman, who's annoyed that one of her employees (Anita Dearly) wants to get married and have children. Because obviously, you can't mix a career and having a family. The undertones of 'career bad, motherhood good' are just unnecessary in a modern children's film. Cruella is more pantomime than actually scary. The lack of original charm isn't replaced with anything else. It's just boring and predictable. This film has an amazingly talented cast, which is completely wasted here. The jokes are just not funny. Most of the film is taken up with lame, unoriginal slapstick. Part of the first sequence has Roger Dearly accidentally trying to steal Perdy because he has mistaken her for Pongo. That's right. He loves his dog so much, he can't even recognise him. The screenwriter obviously has either never had pets or just assumes children are stupid. The dogs are cute, but have no personality. The puppies have very little screen time at all. If you liked the sequels to Home Alone, you might like this movie. If you liked the original cartoon or any recent children's films that actually have a good storyline, you'll be disappointed. I'm afraid most of the reviewers here are giving this movie a pass because 'it's a child's film and you can't expect that much'. Well I do expect better from Disney and I wouldn't subject my children to this film. Try the book instead.

    This was one of those times when remakes are a good idea. It was a remake of a classic and it was the remake of an animated movie to a live one so I approve and it was a good attempt. Evil Cruella De vil wants her assistant Anita to give up her spotted puppies so she can turn them into a coat. Anita is fired for refusing and De vil has the puppies stolen along with many more and the adventure begins of trying to get them back. Of course this movie was no where as good as the original. It didn't have the dogs as the stars like the original and it took the heart out of it. It didn't have the hilarious cat from the first one and that was the funniest bit from the first one. With it being live action many of the funny stunts pulled off in the original was missing. It seems to me that working with that many dogs would be a horrible task for a film maker and you can tell that editor Trudy Ship had her work cut out for her here. John Hughes wrote the screenplay and he made a lot of changes, some obviously had to be made and some had to be made in order to modernize it, it was good and still true to the original. Glenn close WOW, what a perfect job she did here as Cruella, great acting and to me this is her best role. I love Hugh Laurie from House, and he was a great villain and stood out to me from this film. Also, I like Joan Plowright and enjoyed her as the lovable Nannie. Not as good as the cartoon, a bit longer and slow at times. Some great acting and some fillers, boring music that has already dated badly in the 14 years since its release. I also hated the C.G.I. and most of it could have been avoided. The movie was very corny at times, which made it hard to accept as an adult, but this is surely one for the kids...3 out of 10 stars

    So... Disney thought they'd dip into the cash cow and try and rehash the already perfect with no need for modernization movie, 101 Dalmatians. Now with video games, fashion, and modern slapstick humor, this is a wonderfully terrible movie that seems to forget about the stylistic choices and just HOW the original worked. In the original, no one suspects Cruella of doing anything - Anita even states 'She may be eccentric, but she's not a thief.' One of Disney's more downplayed movies, the 1961 original featured wonderful characters, wonderful down to earth animation, wonderful backgrounds, and people you actually cared about. When the dogs go off- on their own - because nobody else saw the sings, it isn't a constant snooze fest of waiting for the off camera crew to have the REAL dogs do what they're supposed to do (in this way, Santa Buddies did it better) but it actually has, (because it was animated) the dogs TALKING. You understand what they want, what needs to happen - because they can speak their minds. Now, we have the police out to get the puppies as well - and Cruella, (whom Glen Close is a good match for) is played up even MORE to the extreme and completely unbelievable as a sane individual that no one would suspect. I enjoyed this movie as a child, but I can't get behind it now. It's too much, too silly, and the original did it right. Sorry.

    Honestly, how is this film NOT on The IMDb Top 250?! This movie reached just as many of my own expectations that Citizen Kane, Gandhi, and Casablanca ever did! Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed these movies, but 101 Dalmatians: The Live Action Version is one of the most underrated films that I have seen in years! The story line may have felt quite predictable, especially if you have seen the equally brilliant original from 1961, but it's the performances that really moved me from my sofa, cheering! Glenn Close's performance as Cruella DeVil was both hilarious, and brought the evilness of the character she was playing as one of the most though-provoking villains on screen! The slapstick with Jasper and Horrace gave this film a "Home Alone" theme towards it, which; in my opinion, worked really well, and the music fitted the mood of the film perfectly! I loved the animals, especially the dalmatians; who were adorable! Ignore any rotten reviews, this very heartwarming, and cute little movie is a must see! 9/10 Written By Alienator Donut.

    I think this is one of those films from the 90s I saw as a kid, but when years have passed, I took one more view of this film again. Besides I knew it couldn't be possibly worse than the earlier movies that the late John Hughes made in the classic 90s. Boy was I wrong. Never have I been so disappointed in this mediocre remake, but I don't think it's the worst movie ever made. Let me point out the stronger points. The cast is pretty tolerable. Jeff Daniels and Joely Richardson did alright as Roger and Anite Dearly. Joan Plowright also did alright as Nanny. Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams did very good as Jasper and Horace, I think, but arguably the best performance throughout the entire film goes to Glenn Close who did such a compelling job as Cruella De Vil. The visuals are very amazing that looked exactly like the Disney cartoon and successful details the look of London, Roger and Anita's house and Cruella De Vil's mansion. Gotta give the director some credit for doing such a great job for visualizing them perfectly. That's it for my praise. The reason why I became so disappointed is because the screenplay was made by the late John Hughes who also wrote screenplays for such great films like the first two Home Alone films, the National Lampoon movies, Pretty in Pink, Breakfast Club and many more, but his career went downhill in the 90s when he wrote screenplays for such great disappointments like Dennis The Menace, Baby's Day Out, Just Visiting, the Miracle on 34th Street remake, and Flubber. In here, his screenplay has pathetically contrived dialogue and inconsistently unfunny humor that seemed too childish. The story is unbelievably predictable. It potentially has some great atmosphere in some of the scenes, but since this a remake of one of the greatest Disney films ever made, we all know what's gonna happen next and the second half becomes repetitive. If young kids want to see this mediocre remake of a Disney classic, be my guest, but only if they enjoy Glenn Close's performance. Otherwise, even that doesn't save this remake from it's incoherent plot and unfunny childish humor. 4/10

    It has been many years indeed since I watched the animated version of this film - in fact, I can't remember watching it all the way through. The thing that Disney do best of all is conjuring up heart-warming tales that only have a loose connection to reality and this is no different. However, I can't help thinking that this has been rather harshly scored on this website. It may be the lovechild of "Home Alone" and "Babe" but despite the excessively kiddie-friendly approach, this remains a surprisingly enjoyable film that doesn't deserve its low score. In a Disneyfied version of London, American video game designer Roger (Jeff Daniels) literally runs into fellow Dalmatian owner Anita (Joely Richardson) after their respective dogs fall in love at first sight. As Roger and Anita get married, Pongo and Perdita (their dogs) are ahead of them when they soon have a litter of 15 puppies. While they welcome the new arrivals, the news is music to the ears of the villainous Cruella De Vil (an electrified Glenn Close) who plans to use the puppies to make a new coat for herself. Trouble is, the plan to snatch the puppies relies on her two goons Horace (Mark Williams) and Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and they aren't exactly blessed in the intelligence department. If you take the cute animals from "Babe" and the madcap slapstick finale from "Home Alone" then you've pretty much got "101 Dalmatians" wrapped up. Thankfully, there is more to recommend than just people falling over into mucky stuff and the biggest of these is Close as Cruella. It is a proper pantomime performance, full of all the cackling laughter and broo-ha-ha you'd ever want. In contrast, Richardson and Daniels seem oddly stoic and you never really feel for them. The true stars are the dogs, who almost all perform exactly as you'd expect (though I shudder to think of the number of takes). The other curious thing, besides the total lack of empathy with the good guys, is how Disney are prepared to play fast and loose with reality - I've lived in the UK all my life and have never seen a raccoon or a skunk in the wild! But despite the little oddities, this remains an enjoyable family film that deserves to be considered. By aiming for a family market, "101 Dalmatians" never tries to be anything other than simple fun. And do you know what - that's exactly what it is. But it never feels anything other than synthetic, sanitised entertainment and although that's what you expect from Disney, I can't help wishing that it could push itself a little further. If it's set in London with a largely British cast, why did it need Disney's interference and gloss smothering everything? It doesn't make it a complete dog's dinner but I can't help wishing they'd let sleeping dogs lie.

    First there is the animated 101 Dalmations, which I love. But then there is this one, the live-action one, which I don't like. This is not terrible, it's just rather boring and a little painful to watch. This movie is rather lame and it induces more groans than laughs. I rarely laughed throughout the course of this movie, in fact, I rarely even smiled. 101 Dalmations somewhat corrupts the meaning of the animated original, especially in the humor department. Whereas the original animated movie had great humor for the entire family, this one is reduced from family humor to childish humor. I like childish humor, but not a movie that is strictly childish humor. A movie needs to have a type of humor that is not for just children, it needs to have a type of humor that is for everybody, not for just one type of person. All in all, this movie is not one of the worst movies ever made, but I just didn't like it, it was too childish and silly for me. I probably would have like it better if the humor would have been more appropriate for somebody like me. Another thing I didn't like about this was the fact that they based this live-action movie on an animated feature film from the 1960's. I have nothing against live-action movies based on cartoons being made, but this was not a good idea. This production wasn't a good idea, it didn't even sound like a good idea. Making live-action movies based on cartoons usually isn't a good idea, it just doesn't seem to work. This movie is proof of that. Kids nowadays are looking for a movie with likable characters and very good humor. This film has neither of those, having lost in its live-action making what the animated original did so right. In short, this movie is boring and unfunny, it is not even that entertaining for children. Adults will probably find it boring just like I did, children may like it, especially very small children. Anyone else? No. 101 Dalmations is not a terrible movie, it is just boring, unoriginal, unfunny, and just plain forgettable. I'll repeat what I said in the above paragraphs, this lame live-action adaption induces more groans than laughs. Do yourself a favor and rent the animated original instead. 4/10

    I remember going and seeing this with my Kindergarden class when this came out and I must say I really enjoyed it. Glenn Close gave a wonderful performance as Cruella De Vil and I don't think that Disney could of casted a better actress. Joely Richardson and Jeff Daniels both gave good performances as Anita and Roger and I also thought that Hugh Laurie and Mark Williams gave good performances as Jasper and Horace. The plot was really good and seemed to live up to the original 1961 cartoon. I liked that they made Roger a video game designer and that he designed Cruella as the villain for his new video game at the end. There were lots of funny scenes from both the dogs and some other animals that appeared in the film. In all a good film that the whole family can enjoy and John Hughes did a good job writing the screenplay just like he did for some other of his films such as Home Alone. All in all 101 Dalmatians is a great family movie that anyone can love. 10 out of 10.

    Live action remakes of animated features almost always wind up being risky affairs. Disney's 101 Dalmatians, a live action version of its classic animated feature, goes well beyond risky and straight into idiotic territory. This jumbled mess of a film is only noteworthy for the animal acting and for an over-the-top Glenn Close performance that gets worse by the second. Unfortunately, even those rare elements of slight interest get glossed over by CGI and a ridiculous set of sequences that turns the minimalistic joy of the original into nothing more than chaotic clutter. 101 Dalmatians strips all the elements from the animated feature for the sake of laziness, it seems, and what we're left with is a completely unnecessary project that demonstrates Disney's unfortunate unwillingness to fully commit to a film with heart.

The key element that made One Hundred and One Dalmatians so fantastic is, alas, missing. Roger meets Anita (Joely Richardson) in the park after a disastrous and apparently hilarious pair of chase sequences because one wasn't enough to set up things. They do what any sensible people do after getting thrown into a park's lake and get married immediately. Also, they both have Dalmatians and now Pongo has a lover. The cuddly dog scenes show us they love each other. Aww. Anita works for Cruella de Vil (Close) a bizarre fur-loving weirdo with designs on the puppies Anita and Roger's doggies eventually have.
