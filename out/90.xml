    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

    This film is in there with my all-time favourite comedies. From the brilliant opening scene all of the way through to the end I was hooked and have now seen it several times since. Mike Myers is hilarious, this is up there with his Austin Powers for brute comedy force. Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

    This film is in there with my all-time favourite comedies. From the brilliant opening scene all of the way through to the end I was hooked and have now seen it several times since. Mike Myers is hilarious, this is up there with his Austin Powers for brute comedy force. Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships.

Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower.

    This film is in there with my all-time favourite comedies. From the brilliant opening scene all of the way through to the end I was hooked and have now seen it several times since. Mike Myers is hilarious, this is up there with his Austin Powers for brute comedy force. Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

    This film is in there with my all-time favourite comedies. From the brilliant opening scene all of the way through to the end I was hooked and have now seen it several times since. Mike Myers is hilarious, this is up there with his Austin Powers for brute comedy force. Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror.

"Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

    This film is in there with my all-time favourite comedies. From the brilliant opening scene all of the way through to the end I was hooked and have now seen it several times since. Mike Myers is hilarious, this is up there with his Austin Powers for brute comedy force. Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

Loads of classic lines and Myers even plays his own dad, even though his Scottish accent isn't particularly up to scratch this character is equally hilarious. Also, watch out for Brenda Fricker who plays his mother, such good casting. The acting is as good as it needs to be, solid from all of the cast, no weak links. The script is the anchor and Myers uses it brilliantly to sculpt out some fine characters and drives this film into comedy gold. OK, so it's not stuff of legend like Monty Python and Ghostbusters but I personally rate it just as highly. If I'm totally honest, if you don't laugh all of the way through this then there's something wrong with you. Watch it, and watch it again! Also, you'll never get The La's - There She Goes out of your head for months. Fair warning.

    Manic in a way that even Austin Powers couldn't match, this vehicle for then-recent SNL grad Mike Myers hasn't aged quite as well as I'd expected. Myers delivers with ease when he's under the guise of a wild, colorful character - his best scenes are as a boisterous, drunken caricature of a father under heavy makeup - but comes off as insecure and off-putting in the more straightforward leading role. For every joke that lands, Myers ricochets three or four duds off his companions' foreheads, lending the impression that he's always on stage and robbing his turn as well-intentioned poet Charlie of a meaningful connection with the audience. Clunky, distracting post-production work and an excessive dose of early '90s pop culture also prove to be tricky obstacles, dating the material and lending the impression that it wasn't quite polished enough for a final release. When it's working, few films from the era are so consistently funny, but those sporadic dots of brilliance aren't quite enough to compensate for the shaky, timid nature of the rest of the story. A great premise with some moments of pure genius, it's probably best enjoyed as a series of expertly trimmed clips on YouTube.

    The leading actor has had huge success with characters Wayne Campbell, Austin Powers and Shrek, but this isn't really one of his remembered films, apart from the catchy title. Basically dedicated coffeehouse poet Charlie Mackenzie (Mike Myers) often bases his material on the numerous failed relationships he has had with women, all ending with doing something weird or high paranoia. His Scottish parents, mother May (Brenda Fricker) and father Stuart (also Myers, putting on his Fat Bastard voice), may criticise him for his wrong-doings, but he may have found the perfect girl to end the comments. Meat butcher with a heart of gold Harriet Michaels (Three Men and a Baby's Nancy Travis), and they start going out with hardly any concerns at all. Reports in the newspapers about some murders of newlywed men in the area, and habits of his new girlfriend, get Charlie back in the state of paranoia, and he is not sure he can fully trust his new love. Eventually he settles down and finds it in himself to ask Harriet to marry him, and they do so with no problems, but of course then the murders have some evidence that could indeed have her as the killer. In the end, after so many occurrences that make him, and you the audience, believe she is this axe murderer, it turns out to be her sister Rose (Pulp Fiction's Amanda Plummer), and Charlie is happy to go on as normal, if possible. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Tony Giardino, Matt Doherty as Heed, The Great Muppet Caper's Charles Grodin as Commandeered Driver, Phil Hartman as Ranger John 'Vicky' Johnson - Alcatraz Guide, Steven Wright as Pilot and Inspector Gadget's Michael G. Hagerty as Obituary Writer. Myers is alright as the vulnerable loser with amusingly crap poems, I laughed probably more when he was in his other guise, and Travis is okay as the very suspicious girlfriend, the script does have some witty moments to keep you on tenterhooks about the situation, but it's not the funniest film, a slightly silly comedy. Okay!

    The suspenseful Mike Myers' farce "So I Married an Axe Murderer" qualifies as a cute but contrived comedy about a twenty-something poet with marriage commitment issues. Myers stars as Charlie Mackenzie, a San Francisco native who loves to perform his 'beat' poetry with a three-man band and a slide-show presentation in the background at coffee shops. Charlie's subject matter is his doomed relationships with women. He falls head over heels in love with the comely Nancy Travis and cannot take his eyes off her. Actually, Charlie has botched all his romantic relationships for one arbitrary reason or another because he fears marriage as a death sentence. When he isn't flirting with Travis, Myers plays his eccentric, opinionated Scottish patriarch Stuart Mackenzie who loves to deride his younger son for his enormous noggin. The elder Mackenzie calls it variously "an orange on a toothpick," "a virtual planetoid," and compares it to a Soviet spacecraft "  that boy's head is like Sputnik, spherical but quite pointy, at parts." Realizing how derisive that he is toward his son and the complex that he may be imparting to his youngest, he observes with mock sympathy: "Now tat was offside, wasn't it? He'll be crying himself to sleep tonight, on his huge pillow." Happily, Myers isn't dominate "So I Married an Axe Murderer" with his dual performance. Co-stars Amanada Plummer, Brenda Fricker, Anthony LaPaglia, Alan Arkin, Phil Hartman, Charles Grodin, a pre-"Seinfeld" Michael Richards, and Steven Wright contribute brief but memorable bits. When Myers isn't wrestling with the proposition of whether 'to wed' or 'not to wed,' he worries about his latest girlfriend and wonders if she isn't secretly a serial killer. "Miss Firecracker" director Thomas Schlamme must have seen the Alfred Hitchcock nail-biter "Suspicion" where Jon Fontaine feared that Cary Grant was a murderer. "So I Murdered an Axe Murderer" brims with hilarity and talent, but Schlamme and "In the Army Now" scenarist Robbie Fox never generate any genuine suspense. Nevertheless, this lightweight lark is still worth watching for Myers' genius and Fox's parody of cop movie conventions. When "So I Married an Axe Murderer" opens, Charlie is cruising around San Francisco in his maroon Volkswagen Kharman Ghia convertible searching for a Scottish delight known as Haggis. He spots a corner butcher shop "Meats of the World," strolls inside, and falls in love at first sight with Harriet Michaels (Nancy Travis of "Chaplin") who works behind the counter chopping up meat. Trouble enters paradise one evening at his parents' house when his loony mom, May Mackenzie (Brenda Fricker of "My Left Foot"), reads to him from her favorite tabloid "The World Weekly News" about a 'black-widow' serial killer who murders her husbands and then vanishes without a trace. When Charlie confides to his San Francisco Police Inspector friend Tony Giardino (Anthony LaPaglia of "Empire Records") that he dreads being with Harriet because she may be a murderer, Tony dismisses Charlie's anxiety as characteristic of all his affairs with women. Again, Charlie suffers from marriage commitment and in the past has blamed his break-ups on his girlfriends when in reality he is the cause of their botched relationships. Nevertheless, Charlie begins to link the murderers with Harriet's history of moving around the country and the unsolved murders of a Florida Russian Martial Arts expert, Atlantic City Lounge Singer, and Dallas Plumber Ralph Elliott. It doesn't help matters when Charlie awakens in bed with Harriet one night and she is screaming the name "Ralph!" Later that morning, Charlie receives a shock when he gets up and tries to slip into the shower with Harriet and is surprised instead to find her sister Rose Michaels (Amanda Plummer of "Pulp Fiction") taking a shower. Eventually, things get so bad that our paranoid protagonist breaks up with Harriet. Altogether, the comedy in "So I Married an Axe Murderer" overshadows the uneven mystery related to the serial killer.

    So I Married an Axe Murderer (1993) Well, there are some scenes in here so hilarious I have been able to watch them over and over. And there are other parts that are pretty lame. I'll admit to fast forwarding a few times, but I watched it straight through again last night and it's not a horrible movie at all. There are some novelties to it (the opening scene with the camera latched to the coffee cup, or even just the incredibly bad beat poetry performances). And there is a clever basic plot, which keeps you guessing (the first time through). I'm not a Mike Myers fan, but then, he's supposed to be an annoying twit in this one, I think. But that's not counting his role as an older Scottish man (sound familiar), which is does with such brilliance it's hard to not love him. (You can see his co-actors laughing too hard, actually, at times--they were overwhelmed by how funny he was.) This is a genre of comedy that is partly made of up individual skits, or even particular moments that are set-ups for one-liners, and so this sequence of funny situations seems at times a little forced together, and by nature a little uneven. But the funniest of them (and we might not agree on all of these) are really really funny. That's worth a lot.

    Written by Robbie Fox, "So, I Married an Axe Murderer" is basically a silly film that is made palatable thanks to the comic genius of Mike Myers and the charms of Nancy Travis. Myers makes the most of all the comic opportunities and often has us laughing in fits. Look out for the nude scene, and Mr. McKenzie, Mike's dad. Nancy Travis is a beauty we don't see enough of, while Anthony LaPaglia, Amanda Plummer and Allan Arkin (unbilled) have great fun in support roles. Charles Grodin pops in briefly too. Directed by Thomas Schlamme. Sunday, January 2, 2000 - Video

    The title is kind of emblematic of the entire film. "So I Married An Axe Murderer." We can visualize the minimal shrug that goes with it. It's a statement that befouls any logic. If you marry an axe murderer, you should be anything but casual and resigned. But the title suggests a lot of funny events and assumptions without being in itself funny. It has an A cast. Mike Myers is a young man in San Francisco, an admirer of the Beat poets, who's always found reasons not to marry any of the girls he dates. Myers plays his own father too, with an outrageous Scottish accent which he uses as an instrument of vituperation. One of his sons has a head of hair so voluminous that it turns his head into "a virtual planetoid. It has its own weather system!" Myers meets Nancy Travis, a local butcher, and they wind up married. She acts kooky at times, while he comes across more and more hints that she is the notorious axe murderer who has disposed of four husbands by the usual means used by notorious axe murderers. It all leads to a perilous chase across the roof tops of their remote honeymoon motel, which looks like a haunted old mansion. The writer, Robbie Fox, gets off a lot of cracks about Hollywood conventions, some good, some routine. In some ways, the most impressive of these (and it may have been unwitting) is when Nancy Travis has just taken a bath in the mysterious hotel and wants to check her face in the fogged-up mirror over the sink. So she clears a spot. And do you know who we see standing behind Travis in the reflection? Absolutely nobody. Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group

    In San Francisco, Charlie reads poetry at a place where the 90s version of hippies or beatniks hang out. His friend Tony works as an undercover cop. His very Scottish father Stuart is a butcher, and his mother May loves the tabloid Weekly World News. Charlie sees a butcher shop that has meats from all over the world. He goes there to buy haggis for his father and meets the cute Harriet who runs the place. Because he has worked for his father and Harriet needs the help, Charlie goes to work there on one of his visits. Eventually Charlie and Harriet start dating. Charlie also meets Harriet's quirky sister Rose. But Charlie finds too many similarities between Harriet and a serial killer his mother is reading about in the tabloids. Meanwhile, Tony doesn't feel satisfaction in his job. He doesn't get yelled at like TV cops do. So will things work out between Charlie and Harriet? I think the movie's title gives it away, but will she really turn out to be a killer? Mike Myers does a fine job as Charlie and is delightfully over-the-top as his father. Nancy Travis is so likable I wish she had done more of these movies. Amanda Plummer is cute in a slightly mentally ill sort of way. Numerous supporting players, some with only a few lines, give wonderful performances. Alan Arkin and Anthony LaPaglia have one particularly memorable scene as Tony finally gets what he wants--though will he regret it? Charles Grodin is great as the driver of a car forced to pick up a hitchhiker on official police business. And Phil Hartman is as stiff as a "Dragnet" cop and as funny as the cast of "Airplane!" as a former Alcatraz guard giving tours of the former prison. This is a wonderfully funny movie with an exciting ending.

    I can't believe this isn't rated higher. This movie has so much going for it I can't list it all. From Mike Myers portrayal of his dad "HEAD, PAPER, NOW" to the awesome job Phil Hartman did as Vicki. When it came out in the theaters I watched it and immediately sat through it again because I was laughing so hard I knew I missed stuff. Here it is almost 20 years later and I still laugh whenever I watch this. I wish they could do a sequel of it 20 years later or something just to see him revive this character. Lots of great shots of San Francisco also. If I show this movie to someone and they don't laugh or it doesn't become a favorite of theirs I don't stay friends with them. A good sense of humor and being able to understand the subtleties behind the obvious humor of this movie is a mark of an intelligent mind and I don't have time for lack wits who laugh at the 3 stooges kind of humor and can't fathom why this is comedy gold.

Travis is oddly beautiful, with a wide face, broad smile, eyebrows that would have to look up the word "curve" in the dictionary, and a sassy figure that, alas, we see too little of. Gee, she looks good. Any normal man would have been proud to be seen standing behind her in that mirror. There are amusing moments, including Charles Grodin as an uncooperative motorist and Phil Hartman as a self-important Park Service employee. The problem is that the laughs are scattered throughout a screenplay that doesn't itself promote amusing situations and the laughter that should follow. (For an example of a truly well-integrated comedy plot with embedded comic moments, I offer "Some Like It Hot.") Myers is kicked in the family jewels and makes a twisted face. A good five-second laugh, but then what? Nothing much. He has to have the same part of his anatomy assaulted again a minute later. Another five-seconds, and we're back to a frenzied pursuit. It's not a bad movie, not insulting in any way, and Myers and the other players are quite good, but it would have been nice had more effort been put into blending the jokes into the narrative instead of making them stand-alone gags, like Myers' reading poetry to a jazz group
