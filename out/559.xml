    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.

    His blonde hair falls perfectly, but not on purpose. He looks up, and those blue eyes are like deep lake water --- as if they could look right into your heart. Pure, beautiful and innocent. It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.

    Hundreds Years of Loneliness----To Lestat

    His blonde hair falls perfectly, but not on purpose. He looks up, and those blue eyes are like deep lake water --- as if they could look right into your heart. Pure, beautiful and innocent. It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.

    Hundreds Years of Loneliness----To Lestat

    His blonde hair falls perfectly, but not on purpose. He looks up, and those blue eyes are like deep lake water --- as if they could look right into your heart. Pure, beautiful and innocent. It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters.

This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.

    His blonde hair falls perfectly, but not on purpose. He looks up, and those blue eyes are like deep lake water --- as if they could look right into your heart. Pure, beautiful and innocent. It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.

    His blonde hair falls perfectly, but not on purpose. He looks up, and those blue eyes are like deep lake water --- as if they could look right into your heart. Pure, beautiful and innocent. It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

It is said that Lestat the vampire wasn't specifically described in this book, originally. However, we are always attracted by the supporting role instead of the leading one, unconsciously violating the intention of the author. Fortunately, Tom Cruise played the role of Lestat in his most beautiful time. Louis. At first sight, Lestat sucked his blood and threw him into the dark sea mercilessly. This was when their destinies were tied together. "I am going to give you the choice ... I ... never had " Killing me softly with you smile, voice, and kiss... Louis hated to kill people, owing to the respect for life. He was the worst student ever. He made Lestat, Prince of the Evil, spent a disgraceful time of 200 years with him. Then there came Claudia, the girl who was made to tie Louis from running away from Lestat. Lestat never doubted Claudia, not the slightest. There was no reason to do so --- she was like his daughter, she held him sweetly with her soft arms, but the next second she reached a knife for his throat. Heartbroken. After all he'd been through, Lestat was nothing but broken bones, living, still, in the ashes of the cemetery. On his face, the beauty that used to exist was now hardly seen. Louis came. "The more you try, the more I want you." The next time they met was fifty years later. It doesn't matter. Fifty years to me was just like a long long sleep. And after all, he came back. The love for Claudia, the feelings for Louis, they were all but a dream that happened 200 years ago. Important of all, the smile, the beauty, they were just like what they were yesterday. Lestat drove away, along with his new story, although, the mystery called "loneliness" never disappeared. This is definitely the most beautiful and thought-provoking vampire movie I ever watched.

    The vampire-crowd are so thirsty for material that they often wind up reviewing the subject more than the actual film. So here are my feelings: Anne Rice was right to have initially complained, publicly and bitterly, about the casting of Tom Cruise as LeStat -- and why she took back such criticism as the film was being released theatrically, I'll never understand. I have nothing against Mr. Cruise, but he's all wrong -- in fact, terrible -- in the film. And Brad Pitt, duller and flatter than I'm accustomed to seeing him, is at least a tad better as Louis... But if you HAD to cast these two actors in "...Vampire", they're playing each others' parts!: Pitt would have been far better as LeStat than Tom. (As would several other stars)... I was hoping for a kind of "La Jetee" feel to the empty netherworld the story was attempting to portray, but these actors, especially Tom, simply weren't the ones). The film is directed with some style, but the wrong casting keeps the movie a bit shrill and at arm's length the entire time. A missed opportunity, nearly-ruined by Hollywood...

    A great movie tells you every time is greatness, shows you so high quality and work precisly in every single detail of the narration and the technical part. Cured with passion and professional convinctions the scenes fit each others like a wonderful paintwork, reflecting the skills, the ideas and a complete expression of what they means. Even the actor, the skillful Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise doesn't fall, Antonio Banderas in a smaller but important part, and a lot of formidable characteristics. I appreciated the direction and the screenplay which is so serious but to interesting, the scenic design ancient and typhical of the period descrived. I liked a lot the enveloping and the final, like a great shynphony sourrended this little artwork, must see it.

    This is what dramatic vampire movies should be. Of course vampires are not real but this one goes in a direction and crafted in a way where it actually makes it seem like it can be possible. Brat Pitt and Tom Cruise make a excellent duo, well at least to watch. And their physical appearance and acting really fit the roles of vampires almost flawlessly. Especially Tom Cruise as the vampire Lestat who is the show stealer in this movie. Although he is the vicious and selfish character that has a strong sense of vanity. But between the two his character is just more entertaining to watch and interesting. I guess because of his nature and mystery behind him or like most villains or anti-heroes they just know what they want. But this movie is basically a Brat Pitt film and his character is the main protagonist named Louis who gets turned into a vampire by Lestat. He is basically the emo character that whimper, sob and complains but sits back and basically does nothing most of the way through. And it's basically his melancholic journey after being turned into a vampire, which is actually enthralling to watch because of his surroundings. This is based on Anne Rice's first vampire novel and although I haven't read any of her books yet. I think this film did a good job of capturing the dark atmosphere. This is a well crafted and dark vampire movie that captures the essence of vampires and is a entertaining and interesting watch. And thanks to the two main actors performances this movie still stands out as a popular vampire movie and it's a shame there wasn't any sequels with the same cast. Unlike the "Twilight" saga which should be forgotten. 8.6/10

    This film was released in 1994. Fortunately for the studio, at this time, Tom Cruise was at the height of his stardom following blockbusters such as Top Gun and Days of Thunder and dramas such as Rain Man and Born on the Fourth of July. Brad Pitt was a young , up and coming star as well. Audiences, particularly female flocked to see these two together in an action film. The film is entertaining for a short period of time(10 minutes, but it quickly becomes an endless montage of useless, emotionless action sequences and Cruise , Pitt and Antonio Banderas, who shows up randomly halfway through the film, saying bad dialog with slow, wannabe sexy expressions on their face. I won't spoil the ending, or any of the second half, but suffice to say, I was not particularly impressed. The film has no tragic or moral implications about what being a vampire is like. Unfortunately, it is simply a vehicle for big film stars to deliver lazy performances. cruise, Pitt, and company come off as posers. Don't waste your time.

    I had watched this in the 90s and remembered it was just OK. Having recently liked some Gothic movies as well as Neil Jordans other movies. Recently watched The Crying Game again and thought it may very well be one of the greatest movies of all time and Ondine wasn't bad at all. I decided to take another look at this too as it was available on Netflix. I liked it more than I initially thought, but it's not a 100 % winner. Not a perfect vampire movie nor a perfect Neil Jordan movie. There are a few really great things about this movie and they are the sets, art direction, as well as some acting (Cruise, Dunst and Rea). They all do absolutely wonderful roles. On the other hand, I didn't like Pitt's acting at all nor Banderas'. Overall Brad Pitt's portrayal is not that bad, it's quite consistent, but in the details it suffers. Many lines are delivered either really stiff or with a theatrical fashion. It looks as if he had trouble with the make-up and not being able to control his facial movement at all, which makes his acting look really unnatural and forced. But he does have his moments and he creates a somewhat likable overall portrait as an opposite to Lestat. (For someone not having read the books.) On the other hand, I really enjoyed Cruises Lestat and would've loved to see Stephen Rea do a bigger role, his small role was absolutely wonderful. One thing I wasn't too fond about this movie either is the fact that it plays like a serious movie, but ends like a blockbuster with a contemporary rock song. It's uneven, feels like something you get when the director and the studio don't quite have the same vision.

    I find it rather amusing that almost twenty years since this film was made I am now comparing it with vampire films that I have recently seen, despite the fact that back when it was released it pretty much set the benchmark for vampire movies. Mind you vampire movies have always been popular, right back to the German silent classic Nosferatu (which is based on Dracula). Dracula itself pretty much defined the modern vampire genre, however many of the subsequent films that were based on that book all generated into slasher flicks when in the end the vampire is staked in his coffin. I guess Anne Rice set a new standard for vampires, and in my mind this moved on to the Vampire: The Masquarade roleplaying game which took the standard even further, to the point that I found it difficult to watch any vampire movies or read any vampire books because they simply did not meet or exceed that particular game. I still believe that Vampire: The Masquarade is a very well developed product, however it now being almost ten years since I last played it I has sort of lost interest in it. Look, I did enjoy this film, but I do not think it is anywhere near as good as some people seem to think it is, and I feel that the end of the film actually drags it down. Okay, it is the first in a series of books, however, like with books, one probably should not actually make a movie with a cliff hanger (unless of course it is Lord of the Rings). Pretty much, even a film, or a book, as a part of a series, should in itself be self contained. There are many other much better vampire films out there, and though I find the Ricean vampires interesting, in the end it simply bores me. Despite the fact that this film stars Brad Pitt, I found that it did not have a clear movement, and was sort of a little baffled about the whole scene where Louis is imprisoned in a crypt, and then goes on a rampage killing all of the vampires in Paris, despite the fact that they were only following orders. This is probably one of those movies that is worth seeing once, but I would probably leave it at that.

    *CONTAINS SPOILERS* This is one of the most traditional vampire movies that every vampire fan should watch. So, I had to watch it. The movie is released almost 20 years ago and the film style betrays it (in a good way). The visual and special effects are very good and the fake blood budget was high. The vampire adaptation is kinda a modern one. The vampires are pictured as supernatural creatures, not devil's creations. Religion is merely a conversation topic for them and they do have reflections. All those are pros. But, what I didn't like were the teeth (they were almost plastic, although the 4 fangs were cool) and Lestat's durability. Drained, burnt and still alive?! The only way to kill him was to expose him to the sun, I suppose. I would like it if he was the original vampire. Clearly he wasn't because he had a maker. For the 3/4 (until Louis burns Armand's theater), the movie has you tied up. You don't want to miss a second, it is almost glamouring you. It even has some funny moments, Lestat dancing and singing with a corpse and then a woman in Armand's theater screaming "Oh yes, Mr.Vampyr, take me, I adore you!" I had to pause the movie to laugh for at least 5 minutes. Really enjoyed that! But the other 1/4... Confusing, without any explanation how and why this or that happened. Although I got that Armand just wanted Louis and killed Claudia and fake-"rescued" Louis to make him feel that he is his savior, I don't get how easily Louis burned and killed all those vampires. And then poof!, Lestat is inside a house (is it the one they burned with him inside?), almost dessicated. If it is their old house, how no one entered that abandoned house from the day it was burned to notice him? And why Lestat sit there? Then, a helicopter comes out of nowhere and lights the place. Louis leaves and the helicopter is staring at the almost dessicated Lestat. What happened next? And at the end of the movie, Lestat finally kicks in dessicated (so the helicopter just left?) and feeds on the interviewer. How was he able to move and fly there if he was dessicated and couldn't flinch when he was in that house? And most importantly, how he knows how to drive?! Cruise and Dunst delivered us possibly their best performances with this movie. Cruise was able to portray Lestat SO good, so crazy, so lunatic, so evil... I just loved it! And Dunst, the vampire kid was so cute and deadly at the same time, what a talented actress from such a young age! Pitt, however, sucked (in a bad way). His performance ranged from terrible to mediocre. I don't get it, since he is a brilliant actor... I guess he just can't portray a vampire. A bad taste was left to me with Banderas' performance as well. To sum up in a few words, a great yet confusing vampire movie that is. Recommended and "must" for the vampire fans.

    It about a vampire (Brad Pitt) tell a interviewer (Christian Slater, who replaced the late River Phoenix) about his immortal life from 18th-century New Orlean-modern day San Francisco. How he becoming a vampire after Lestat (Tom Cruise) give him the "dark gift". Louis's horrified by his blood-lust and whines about it. Lestat turn recently orphan little girl, Claudia (a young Kirsten Dunst) into a vampire to prevent Louis from leave him but he doesn't realize he made it worse... It get boring when it get to the middle of the movie. Everybody in the movie can't act (except for Kirsten Dunst. She the only one that could act she gave best performance as the vicious child vampire who will be forever a child.) Tom Cruise performance is over-the-top as the seductive and powerful Lestat. Louis is whiner; he doesn't like being a vampire (but he was not thinking because he was too upset about his wife death). Brad Pitt is the best looking vampire in this although his vampire make-up is frightening looking but he's still attractive. The movie has good Gothic themes with humor and dark fantasy. If the movie ever get reboot, next time cast better actors, please?

    Before there was True Blood; before there was Twilight; before Buffy, Angel and Vampire Diaries (pah!), there was Interview with the Vampire. An excellent adaptation of Anne Rice's first novel, Tom Cruise's 'Lestat' leaps off the page in all his pomp and swagger. Pitt's 'Louis' is the ideal foil, righteous and idealistic, their partnership melded by Kirsten Dunst's 'Claudia'  a terrific performance at the age of twelve. Neil Jordan has a good cast and employs them all well, brilliantly capturing the scope of the story and the essence of its characters. The soundtrack also deserves star billing, a spellbinding collection by Elliot Goldenthal that captures not only the action, but the locations and the era. To me the cleverest layer in Rice's story, from which she adapted the screenplay herself, is the commentary on the inability of some vampires to change with the times, ably highlighted in the closing scenes and the final moment on the Golden Gate Bridge, one of my favourite uses of popular music in film, and so very, very right for that wonderful closing line reprise. There is beauty and ugliness in equal measure, and a grand sweep of storyline that beautifully captures the span of time and the weight of years, the excitement and the ennui. Interview... is a great watch, a thrilling journey full of anguish and melancholy, glamour and guts  showing that vampires are by no means the 'youthful', glossy, beautiful creatures that the networks and studios now want you to believe for the purposes of prime-time. So many 80's movies do not stand the test of time, but this is one that will never grow old  a must for your list if you have never seen it.
