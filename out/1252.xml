    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.

    There are some films that can't really be contained into a simple paragraph and mere words can't express what they're really all about. In a word, I thought "Contempt" was marvelous. In several words, it was also beautiful and heartbreaking. This is a film that I really wanted to like and usually when I want to like something, I don't. This time I more than liked what I wanted to like, but rather, I loved it! Let's cover the basics and then we'll get into some of the more symbolic elements and some of my interpretations. The acting is fine, with Palance being a surprisingly good fit and a really great pair of finds in Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot. They had great chemistry together, even though their characters, for the most part, lacked chemistry. And what about that music? It was almost tear inducing. There were times throughout the picture when it would strike up and I'd wonder if I was supposed to be feeling something at that moment. It was such a powerful score and it was played throughout A LOT of the movie. Played too much, perhaps? Well, it was just so good, that I can't bring myself to say that, but it's possible I guess. So, anyway, Camille is mad at Paul for not protesting when Jerry offered to take her alone in the car. Jerry was obviously hot for Camille and his reasoning for wanting to be alone with her was absolute poppycock, "Oh Paul, you surely won't be comfortable stuffed into the backseat, why don't you take a cab", to which Paul replied, "Oh sure Jerry, I'll just take a cab". Come on dude, you're wife is a gorgeous blonde and this arrogant, confident, good-looking man, whom you can't understand, is going to take her alone and all you can say is, "sure, why not". Now, on the other hand, does Camille's eventual backlash due to Paul's decision warrant such drastic measures? I mean, it's later revealed, when Paul recounts his interpretation of Homer's Odyssey, that he really did it because he had faith in his wife. He knew she wouldn't cheat on him, so he didn't have any problem allowing her to go alone with Jerry. It's a situation that I can see both points of view on, so therefore, the film works for me, because their arguments always seem genuine. I can see both sides, so all of the questions from Paul and all of the actions from Camille make, at least, some sense. I have to say I was pretty proud of myself for picking up on the correlation between Paul, Camille & Jerry and Ulysses, Penelope & Poseidon. Of course, it's all laid out for you, so it's not as if you've had to have read The Odyssey. I also (and I'm not lying) picked up on Bardot's resemblance to Anna Karina (Godard's real life wife) when she donned the black wig. In fact, even from there I made the assumption that Camille dying in the end was Godard's way of saying, "Take that bitch!". I can already tell that Godard didn't have a very high opinion of women and that, for the most, part he thought them to act very childish and stubborn and possibly had great disdain for them or maybe just one in particular. Obviously here, Godard takes the side of Paul, playing down his actions and heightening the complaints and absurd behavior of Camille and then killing her for being so bull-headed. You can also look at the camera shots, specifically those from the entire scene in the apartment, when the two are at the height of their argument. Godard isn't constantly forcing us into the situation, but, for the most part, allowing us to peer through doorways, as if we're peering in on a real-life disagreement - possibly his way of saying, "it's more than a movie folks, it's my life - take a look". Godard also seemed to be trying to say something, in the fact that you had Paul, a playwright who could form interpretations of Homer's writings and understand quotes about Dante, but couldn't interpret his own wife's emotions. Perhaps he's trying to say that women are impossible to understand? I had a deep desire to understand every facet of this film. While I'm sure I didn't understand EVERY FACET, I think I swallowed it very well and understood the majority of it. This blow's "Breathless" and "My Life to Live" out of the water. I just finished and I can say, I honestly can't wait to see it again and try to fit more of the puzzle pieces into place.

    Jean-Luc Godard's "Contempt" follows a few days in the life of Paul Javal (Michel Piccoli), a screenwriter working under hire for an American producer (Jack Palance) to write an adaptation of the Odyssey, which already has Fritz Lang (who plays himself) as a director. After Paul and his beautiful wife Camille (Brigitte Bardot) go visit the producer's house, all of the sudden Camille feels distant from her husband, who, with this project he's agreed to work on, evidently chose to change his own career's direction, since he had always been and seen himself as a playwright. The story culminates when they go to Capri together, to join the film crew shooting the movie. While "Contempt" has a distinct Godardian style, it's a film that doesn't offer any new takes of the artist's insight: it's all been seen in previous works of his, and whatever traits are recognizable from other films of the director's, it isn't rare that one is reminded of the other film, instead of enjoying these traits as if they appeared new and refreshing. Examples include the dialogue, which isn't as memorable as other writings by Godard, but also the themes that unfold: being an alienated couple immersed in a post-modern world is a conceptual condition dear to Godard, because it reflected his real-life problems in some fashion: but in other films he has brought the problem of the relationship in a more original and attention-grabbing way: here, due also to the lethargic pace of the film, it feels tired. Despite these complaints, "Contempt" is an interesting and intelligent effort: the progression of the story, no matter how slow it might be, is still extremely well developed and shows a great deal of narrative sophistication on behalf of the author, and carries as much finesse as a heavy-weighted existential novel (it is, in fact, a movie based on a book by Alberto Moravia). Moreover the characters of the film (although neither extremely well-performed nor memorably developed) drive the film forward interestingly and quirkily, not really as three dimensional people, but more as moving statues posing on a stage: not a negative statement, just an observation on how inventively Godard was able to direct his actors.

    Directed by Jean-Luc Godard, Contempt is a 'new wave' French film full of 'French emotions' and rather a lot of unhappy and/or weird people. It stars Brigitte Bardot and Michel Piccoli as Camille and Paul Javal, a young couple ravaged by marital and emotional difficulties and in the case of Camille either low self esteem or mental illness and an anger management problem. Paul (a screen writer) has his demons too and it's hard to figure out if he's a nice guy with a crazy wife or a sly and manipulative guy who has driven his wife crazy - and that's the crux of this movie. Contempt. The contempt that Camille feels for her spouse, the contempt her spouse feels for the crass American film Producer, Jeremy Prochosh (played by Jack Palance) who wants to commercialize Fritz Lang's Ulysses. The difficulty with this movie is that it's unclear whether the problems Camille and Paul had in their relationship existed prior to Paul's involvement with Prochosh and co. However, Camille's insecurities are showcased in the opening scene. What 'Contempt' does best is realism, and one of the most striking scenes involves Camille and Paul arguing (for what seems like hours) as they go about their business in their apartment; walking past each other, getting dressed, preparing dinner etc. The ending is unexpected but then again perhaps not if one takes Paul's interpretation of the Odyssey to heart? 'Contempt' certainly lives up to its title and is well acted, entertaining (in a voyeuristic way), and makes you uncomfortable because the acting is so 'real'.

    When I first got to college, I was already into cinema and elected an intro to film course. I was only watching modern movies at that point, mostly American, and I was unsatisfied with most of the films we were watching for the class (most of them I've come around to liking since, though they all have a bit of a stigma of being attached to that class). The one big exception was Godard's Breathless, which kind of blew me away. It just felt fresh, where so many of those other films felt dated to me. Outside of the class, when exploring a video store's foreign section, a friend and I picked up Contempt - I wanted to see more Godard and he wanted to see more Brigitte Bardot (I have no idea how he already knew about her). He got the better deal, with Bardot's beautiful bum gracing the screen for a few glorious minutes. I was unsatisfied with this follow-up to Breathless. I think I avoided Godard for a year or two afterward, but I started liking him again when I saw Band of Outsiders. I pretty much ate up all of his other films afterward, loving most of them. I had always meant to get back to Contempt, but never did. Unfortunately, several years ago, particularly after Notre Musique, I fell out of love with Godard. This second viewing of Contempt is the first Godard film I've watched or rewatched since Notre Musique (though I've bought several, including Contempt). I wonder, if I had watched it when I was in my Godard period, would I have loved it as I did so many others? Strangely enough, I felt almost exactly the same way about Contempt that I felt about it the first time: it's gorgeous, but, lord, is it a bore. I can almost live on the images alone - especially all the images of Bardot. But, much like Bardot herself, Contempt comes across as gorgeous but utterly empty. None of the other performances are any good, either. Palance, whom in general I like, is particularly awful. Piccoli is a total bore, too, and I can't help feeling a man who looks so much like an ape shouldn't be with Bardot. It's interesting to see Fritz Lange as an actor, but he doesn't have much to do. Really, the only character I had any real attraction to was Giorgia Moll, who may be even prettier than Bardot. The film'd almost be better without any people in it - the scenery is plenty good. But they'd also have to remove that terrible, repetitive score to make it worth sitting through - it's easily the worst part of the whole film. "But it's Brechtian!" my film professor would say. "*beep* off!" I would reply.

    Godard is one of my favorite directors and I love his films, but nothing like this happened with Contempt.... It was disappointing... I absolutely adore his use of vibrant colors (red, blue, white) and I think that if you turn off the sound (or remove the subtitles) it makes it a totally unique visual experience.. Cammille (Brigitte Bardot) was one of the most annoying movie characters I've ever seen...Seriously, I couldn't stand her. But I guess that's why I love the ending !!! I believe that this movie became successful mostly because of Brigitte Bardot... I don't think I will ever watch it again, but if I do then it will be without subtitles...!

    Occasionally, I like to tick off the movies I haven't yet seen from the Sight and Sound and Cahier Du Cinema lists of greatest films of all time (yes, I am that sad  what's it to you?). Le Mepris is in 22nd and 15th place respectively. It is really deep. Firstly it tells you that you are watching a movie, not real life. Then we meet Michel Picolli, who is pretending to be a writer named Paul Javal and Brigitte Bardot, who is pretending to be his wife, Camille. Please note: these are characters in a movie, not real people. Camille gets Paul to identify all the parts of her he likes. She asks: "Do you prefer my breasts or my nipples?" Faced with a question like that, most men would just get their coats and quietly leave. Here, it is the audience that should have taken the hint. We learn that Paul has been hired to re-write Fritz Lang's picture of the Odyssey. Camille then gets into a pet because she thinks he has deliberately thrown her at the crass producer Prokosch (Jack Palance). She may be right, but since Paul has already got the job it is not clear what his motive might have been. The middle stretch of the movie consists of a single thirty-minute scene (in long takes and frequently in long shot) in which the couple engage in one of those endless, circular, bickering arguments that are calculated to drive everybody mad. "What's wrong?" "Nothing" "Yes, there is" "You know what's wrong" "How could I, if you won't say?" "Well, if you don't know, I can't tell you" Finally it emerges that she no longer loves him and feels nothing but contempt (probably because of the Prokosch incident). They can't leave it at that: "Why do you despise me?" "You know why" "No I don't" Give me strength! Eventually they go to Capri to make the Odyssey movie, where they continue to bicker until Camille decides to leave Paul and is killed in a car crash. I nearly forgot, everybody talks about Nicholas Ray and Howard Hawks movies and they all swop quotations from Dante and Bertolt Brecht. Paul and Camille tell each other revealing fables about Ramakrishna and asses buying flying carpets. Also, the music sometimes swells up so much that it almost drowns out the dialogue. Where was that swelling music during the argument scene when we needed it? Finally, this masterpiece stops. At this point you realise you are 103 minutes nearer your own death which, curiously, seems to have lost some of its sting. PS: Fritz Lang is both real and not real. I told you it was deep.

    No, I'm really not a person that likes everything that is French and 'old'. As a matter of fact, I'm not too big on Jean-Luc Godard and really don't like all of his movies. This movie however was one I nearly fell in love with. In all truth and honesty, I was absolutely taken by its movie its style and approach. It's visuals were splendid and its subject manner was truly an unique and great one as well. It's a sort of a shame that the movie somewhat lost me in its middle part and its end also definitely wasn't as great as the beginning but overall this remains a movie I really admire and can be positive about. Of course it's being an artistic movie but what I like about it is that its being quiet and subtle art. It doesn't ever goes over-the-top with any kind of weirdness and instead really takes its time to subtly show and tell you what this movie is all about. The movie does truly feel like a moving painting. It's also because of the compositions and camera-work that the movie uses. It's filled with long shots, in which the camera is also occasionally slowly moving but never toward its subjects. It's being a very subjective, observing movie that views everything from a distance and doesn't use close-ups or any other movie tricks to bring out or emphasize certain emotions. I absolutely loved the cinematography and not just because of its use of vibrant colors. It makes the movie almost an hypnotic one and completely sucks you in. Because of the movie its approach and overall style of storytelling, you are forced to constantly keep paying attention, which will suck you all the more into the movie itself. Even when there is very little happening or being said, it still feels like there is plenty going on in this movie and I also most certainly won't call this a boring one. The movie is already a very special one for the fact that is stars the legendary director Fritz Lang in it, who is playing himself. He probably did it as a favor and out of respect for director Jean-Luc Godard, since Lang never starred in anything. It's basically good and fun to watch all actors in this, who each speak their own language. French, English, German and Italian gets constantly spoken throughout the entire movie, no doubt to also emphasize the differences and contrasts in the characters, who all have their own ideas about finishing a particular Fritz Lang directed movie. Besided the name of Lang, also the names of Brigitte Bardot and Jack Palance should arouse certain people's curiosity. But the movie does not only tickle the brain and is a feast for the eyes, it's easily great to the ears, due to the wonderful classical musical score by Georges Delerue. A true mesmerizing viewing experience! 8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    I was intrigued to watch a film by Godard with Bardot. I cannot say I am impressed. It is a rather pretentious and boring story dealing with petty and insignificant conflicts. Godard has tried to expose the artificiality of cinema. But ironically this very film is extremely artificial. Because in order to expose artificiality, you have to be genuine yourself. And that is exactly what Godard is not. The very dialogs, the constant moving of the characters, the lack of motivation in their actions etc. are far from real life. The American is nothing but a malicious caricature, the constant repetitions of "Do you love me?" "Why don't you love me?" and the like are tedious. I just could not identify with any of the characters even partially. The subject of good and cultured Europe vs. bad and vulgar America is very primitively shown. And the film relies too much on Bardot's sex-appeal to maintain the viewer's interest.The very first minute of the film we are confronted by Bardot's naked ass. Curiously, even the eroticism in the film is cold and sterile, as indeed is the whole film. Maybe the only good thing is the setting where the whole story takes place i.e. the beautiful island of Capri and Villa Mallaparte which is one of the most interesting examples of modern architecture. But this alone is not enough for a film, alas!

    Jean-Luc Godard's 6th feature film tells the story of American film producer Jeremy Prokosch, highly regarded Austrian-American filmmaker Fritz Lang and novelist and screenwriter Paval Javal who are collaborating on a film adaption of Homer's "Oddysey", which causes critical disagreements. The process estranges the screenwriter from his wife Giorgia Moll, and the rising conflict between the three men results in her becoming the fourth member of the production. French-Swiss film critic and director Jean-Luc Godard's adaption of an Italian novel written by Albert Moravia in 1954 called "II disprezzo", is an Italian-French co-production shot exclusively in Italy, which centres on the marital challenges a young couple faces during a pretentious film production. This vigorous drama from La Nouvelle Vague's most prominent and outspoken representative is an intriguing illustration of the filmmaking process constructed through a linear narrative which is accompanied by French composer Georges Delerue's melodic and instrumental theme song. Jean-Luc Godard's directing in this film within a film is striking. The way he uses repetitions of previous scenes to create subtle transitions, the long takes where the pace is progressed by the dialog, the fast tracking shots, his attenuate camera movements, his structured perspectives and the tension he manages to maintain while depicting rich character portrayals of the two protagonists embodied by Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot, is impressive. The ravishing cinematography by Raoul Coutard, especially of the alluring landscapes on the Capri Island and the luminous milieu depictions creates evident contrasts to the main characters' contradictory relationship. "Le M&eacute;pris" has a throughout uncanny atmosphere and the memorable scenes with Michel Piccoli and Brigitte Bardot are finely acted in a film that possesses the distinctions of a masterpiece.

    For those who were utterly bored by Jean Luc Godard's 'Contempt', I urge you to watch the Criterion Collection's version, with the DVD commentary by Professor Robert Stam turned on. Stam's commentary actually explains what Godard was trying to do in the film and is not only a fascinating analysis of the plot but a wholly worthwhile digression as to the history of the film's production. In no way, however, do I agree with Professor Stam's unqualified praise of its director, Mr. Godard, as well as his implied conclusion that 'Contempt' is an important part of cinematic history. As Stam points out, 'Contempt' was relatively a big budget production in relation to Godard's other 'New Wave' films during his heyday. The film wouldn't have been made without the presence of Brigitte Bardot who at that time was considered a sex symbol. The producers made it clear to Godard that there had to be at least three scenes where Bardot appeared in the nude. The anti-establishment Godard agreed to a 'compromise' and inserted Bardot nude scenes at the beginning,middle and end of the picture. Working under those restrictions, Godard turned the tables on his chiefly American backers ('Contempt' was a joint Italian/American production) by ensuring that there was nothing 'lurid' about the nude scenes. Quite the contrary, Godard mocks Hollywood's obsession with sex by having Bardot intellectualize her sexual endowments in a bland bedtime conversation between the principal characters, Camille (Bardot) and Paul (Michel Piccoli). Later, Camille is seen as an ordinary housewife in the bathtub, reading a biography of Fritz Lang. The 'Contempt' plot is rather simple. Paul, a novelist/playwright is hired by an American producer, Jeremy Prokosch (played by Jack Palance) to re-write the script of a film based on Homer's "The Odyssey'. The film within a film is directed by real-life director Fritz Lang who plays himself. Godard creates a straw man in the character of Prokosch who he depicts as a boorish American, obsessed with money and sex. In a twist on Nazi Propaganda Minster Goebbel's famous utterance, Prokosch proclaims, "Whenever I hear the word culture, I pull out my checkbook". His one-dimensional villainy is further illustrated when he's seen leering during one of the film-within-a-film dailies of a nude, mermaid-like woman, swimming in the ocean. It's no accident that Godard cast Palance as the repulsive producer, as Palance was known for his tough guy roles at the time. If Prokosch is your one-dimensional villain, Godard's 'hero' is director Lang. In real-life, Lang was known for his 'tough love' approach in directing actors but none of his irascible personality is on display here. Rather, he's placed on a pedestal and merely acts as a platform for Godard's views on art and culture. Lang's 'all-knowing' interpretation of Ulysses as organically linked to nature is contrasted with Paul's relationship with Camille, which is doomed to failure. Most of 'Act 2' of 'Contempt' involves the 'quarrel' scene between Paul and Camille. Paul is depicted as an imperfect, if not failed, Ulysses. As usual, Godard seeks to subvert typical Hollywood conventions by deemphasizing the dramatic conflicts between the two principals. At the height of their quarrel, Godard employs a slow tracking shot, which symbolizes the distance between Paul and Camille. Godard deflates the audience's expectations further when Paul puts a gun inside his jacket but never uses it. Finally, Camille keeps telling Paul that he despises him but never provides a decent explanation. The audience is left hanging and one can imagine Godard smiling behind the camera murmuring to himself, 'aha, you were expecting another typical Hollywood resolution, but you will not get it from me'! In the end, Godard's agitprop cinema is all style over substance. His film is filled with 'gimmicks' that many well-known critics and filmmakers hail as hallmarks of bold experimentation. So in the 'audition scene', where the sound is continually turned on and off, that's an example, according to Professor Stam, of Brechtian distancing. In order to avoid the tendency toward voyeurism, "art should display the principles of its own construction". Even the 'grand' climax of 'Contempt' ends with an intentional deflation. Prokopsch and Camille are killed in a car accident but we never see the crash. Instead, we're treated to a glimpse of Camille's farewell letter to Paul, stock audio of a car crash and then a final shot of the victims unnaturally facing in opposite directions with their convertible slightly mangled between the tires of a tractor trailer. Despite his love of film noir, Godard's anti-American bent was evident way back when he was the film critics' darling. Godard reserves his greatest contempt for the Hollywood studio system. In contrast, in the idealized figure of Lang, European culture emerges triumphant. Now in his later days, Godard's anti-Americanism seems to have become more pronounced (see NY Times and Roger Ebert's review of Godard's 2001 film Eloge de l'amour) as well as displaying marked tendencies of anti-Semitism (see the article, "Jean-Luc Godard, Robert Brasillach, and Anti-Semitism: Some observations" by Glenn Kenny). 'Contempt' is worth seeing just so one can note the lengths Godard went to promote his rather simplistic view of so-called Hollywood 'corruption'. Godard's put down of film convention is effected without the necessary good-natured ribbing and all his 'gimmicks' can't hide the fact that his contemptuous world view is fraught with half-truths and an adolescent piety.
