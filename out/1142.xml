 <sinopse>
  A documentary of the 1974 heavyweight championship bout in Zaire between champion George Foreman and underdog challenger Muhammad Ali.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  It's 1974, Muhammed Ali is 32 and thought by many to be past his prime. George Forman is ten years younger and the Heavyweight champion of the world. Promoter Don King wants to make a name for himself and offers both fighters five million dollars apiece to fight one another, and when they accept, King has only to come up with the money. He finds a backer in Mobutu Sese Suko, the dictator of Zaire and the "Rumble in the Jungle" is set. A musical festival, featuring the America's top black performers, like James Brown and B.B. King, is also planned.

    The fight between Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay and George Foreman in Zaire. The fight was nicknamed the rumble in the jungle. The documentary follows Ali and Foreman. It also has insight from writers and witnesses, Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and African American film director, Spike Lee, who later directed the film, "Ali." This documentary is a rare treasure that captures history, culture, and relationships. Ali is the underdog in the ring against Foreman on October 30, 1974. The outcome is remarkable as is the story behind both fighters. Ali is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa. He was proud to see Africans who flew, lived, and governed their own country. Sadly, Ali isn't well with Parkinsons. The disease has crippled his voice but not his message in recent years. The documentary is historical for so many reasons.

    To anyone born after Muhammad Ali's heyday as a boxer, it would be difficult to describe the impact he had on American life and culture. Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. "When We Were Kings" is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like "When Ali Was King", even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman. Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country. Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with. Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.

    This is the Oscar winning documentary about the legendary boxing bout between Muhammad Ali, the challenger and George Foreman, who was the reigning world heavy weight boxing champion of the time. The match became popular as "Rumble in the Jungle". it was held at Kinshasa, Zaire. Both the fighters were blacks. However, Ali was revered as a demi-God because he had spoken about the atrocities which the African Americans were facing in the US and had refused to go and fight in Vietnam. He was considered a true representative of the blacks. George Foreman, as the documentary says, was "blacker than Ali". But still he was taken as the white devil incarnate. The match was promoted by Don King. the President of Zaire decided to give the financial rewards to the fighters as he planned to use the bout to promote his country and his despotic rule. the build up to the fight and then the fight itself have been captured perfectly. there are glimpses about Ali's interaction with the citizens of Zaire who constantly urge him to "Ali, Boma Ye" which means "Ali, Kill Him". The movie is very gripping and shows the human face of the Gods of the Gloves. Two thumbs up.

    While watching "When We Were Kings", I was distracted by many "what if" questions: "what if Foreman had won that match in Zaire?" "What if Ali had lost?" "What if it was a flop?" etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start. And "Rumble in the Jungle" is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice. And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit: self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning: anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast  but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend. One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated: "No Vietcong ever called me a N-word". Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes: more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing: that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself. This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, "Rumble in the Jungle" could have been subtitled the "Ali show". The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign. And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation  and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. "When We Were Kings" provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty. Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match. How about the victory then? Well, I guess my "what if" questions were unthinkable in Ali's mind. It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while "When We Were Kings" is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

    When We Were Kings (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely entertaining, Oscar-winning documentary covering the 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, which became known as the Rumble in the Jungle. Through interview footage as well as archival footage, director Leon Gast's film perfectly documents the historic match and everything leading up to it. The boxing match itself is legendary and something most people know about and it's perfectly shown here but I think the real key to the documentary is everything we're shown leading up to the fight. This, of course, includes a lot of stuff dealing with Ali trash talking and getting involved with the African people. There are several scenes where Ali is simply out in the streets working out and trying to pump up the African people and of course get them in his corner. By contrast, we then see interview segments with Foreman where he's obviously not as deeply in with the people and doesn't have the same connection that Ali does. One really gets a great idea of the political climate heading up to the fight and the stuff with Ali training and just being himself are truly priceless. It's also fun hearing about how his career was thought to have been on the low-end as everyone was thinking that Foreman would destroy and possibly kill him in the ring. When we finally get to the fight footage it's presented in such a way that you really see what Ali was going for and how he pulled the upset. We see some terrific footage that is broken down and we're shown every little point that helped get Ali the win. WHEN WE WERE KINGS shows a historic fight and the surroundings around it and you can't help but be thankful that such an important event was captured in such a great form.

    The story of Muhammed Ali and the famous "Rumble in the Jungle" is the stuff of legend; the world's best boxer becomes a hate figure for middle America and is banned for political reasons; he returns but has lost his edge; he gets a last shot at the world title in a fight to be held in Zaire, whose kleptomaniac dictator is willing to put up his people's cash to pay for it; and against all the odds, he astonishingly beats the superior puncher George Foreman through a combination of wit and bravery. Ali was beautiful and clever as well as violent; his "art" destroyed him, but it's easy to tell his story as a kind of noble myth. Which is exactly what 'When We Were Kings', a documentary that relies relatively little on talking heads (because the whole drama was a kind of performance, and filmed) does. The film even gets its soundtrack for free thanks to the musicians brought in to publicise the fight. I don't even like boxing, but it's still a compelling story; but also watch 'Thrilla in Manilla', a film about Ali's next fight, for a story that takes something of the gloss of his personal sheen.

    I don't believe the film is as flawed as some of the previous reviewers have stated. The footage was all from the early 70's and in that sense this is truly a film of it's time. This is a time and a place that doesn't exist any more, and even Zaire doesn't really exist anymore, its now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When Ali and Foreman fought it was a dictatorship under Mobutu, who wanted a spectacular sporting event held in his country. For me, the musicians, and the black culture elements are nothing more than an interesting backdrop of a superbly talented athlete trying to overcome almost insurmountable odds. Again and again we are reminded of the lack of belief in the Ali camp as Foreman destroyed one heavy bag after another. The key moment of the film for me can almost (but not totally) be encapsulated in Norman Mailer's anecdote at the end of the first round, where he claims he could see Ali looking within himself, and slowly concluding that this was THE moment in his life. Ali was standing in a ring with a man he knew he could not bully, who was stronger than him, could hit harder than he could, and was as determined to force his will on Ali as Ali was determined to do likewise. There is no purer moment of epiphany captured in any documentary I have yet seen. Here was a man out-gunned in almost every department, who with a combination of pure skill, guile, determination, athletic prowess and self belief, managed to overcome a ferocious and worthy opponent. Foreman cannot go without mention. Every David needs his Goliath. He was awesome in ability and dignified in manner. He had destroyed both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in spectacular fashion in the eighteen months before this fight and was at the top of his game. People would do well to remember Foreman was still knocking people out until 1997, when he KO'd Lou Savarese in the 12th round. They surely don't make 'em like they used to. Nobody except Ali believed he could overcome such an opponent. And what the documentary reveals to us is that in his darker moments, even he had doubts. He did not, however, let them stand in his way. This documentary is absolutely inspirational in almost every department. The fact that Ali was also a man of the people and recognised the dignity of African's in spite of their grinding poverty adds yet another dimension to this wonderful film, and to the man himself. As George Plimpton so concisely said "My God, the man's a politician too!" A truly great film , about a spectacular moment frozen in time, and a truly great leading man in Ali. I cannot close without commenting on the effect this loss had on Foreman. It hurt him deeply, and there is no one more pleased than I that he came back and shook the world a second time many years later.

    Now, the file can be viewed as a History, a bit of Politics, good sweet, natural African music and of course one Great Boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Foreman, (while millions & millions of Ali fans chanting his name "... Ali...Bumbaye, ... Ali...Bumbaye" (meanign Ali, Kill him)). Did I forgot to mention, entertaining performance by the Great Muhammad Ali!! Well, it is Entertaining, as far as I know Muhammad Ali(of course I have limited knowledge in boxing or in any other field.) was a calm guy, who only knows Boxing & till now thought that Mike Tyson was the only great. But when I saw this movie, I came to know Muhammad Ali not only as a Great Boxer, but also, as a man who can talk on various subjects, a political and a African leader and as a Man with a cause & of course as a great Entertainer. Why I brought Mike Tyson name in an Ali's Documentary review! Well, to compare one great we need another, Mike Tyson was a great Boxer, a street kid, who fought many fights & won many matches because in coach Cus D'Amado told him to do so... & of course he won them in Style, but after his mentor & coach's demise, he talk a clear direction & purpose. When it comes to Ali, he fought & won for his community with a Noble cause, I guess at that time African countries were ruled by European Colonies, and Black people were treated there as slave and so does in US where they were discriminated, Ali Fought for Black Pride, he wanted to show his people that there are second to none in this world, he wanted them to fight for their cause and the freedom of their countries from Europeans. I read many reviews of Hoop dreams, and has to watch it, I guess this documentary will be comparable to that & it should be Ali Dreams, Ali dreamt & told the world that he is the Greatest, many did not believe at that time when a young Guy told so, but Ali proved what he meant & showed the world his Dream, I guess they all came true. So, as a Pack this movie(Documentary) got it all a bit of history, music, politics, sport & of course loads of Entertainment.

    Inspiring, amazing true story of Ali's comeback/retirement fight against George Foreman. Leon Gast, with help from Taylor Hackford, has taken the times, the black cause, and two giants of boxing and fashioned a fascinating narrative and an insightful culture study of a nation and its people. It's true the material is to die for, but Gast knew just what to do with it. I am no boxing fan, and consider the sport uncultured and physically dangerous, yet I was glued to this doco from start to finish. Especially insightful were the comments from the then fight writers, including Norman Mailer. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    This film should be made mandatory watching for all school children. Historically it covers the greatest sporting event of all time and at the same time chronicles the amazing man himself. The Champ is not just articulate and charismatic... he touched the hearts of all the oppressed people of the time. He was a poor mans champion... a ghetto superstar. I wasn't alive at the time, but the film portrays brilliantly what an underdog Ali was and how everyone half expected Foreman to kill him. Then it shows how Ali very cleverly outwitted his opponent. Psychologically Ali was a heavyweight and Foreman a lightweight. With heart and determination he overcame the colossus that was Foreman. Watching Foreman in this documentary and his awesome power... I don't believe any boxer since has had the punching power of this man. For god sake he came back at 45 and won the title! Imagine what he was like at 20. The Rumble in the Jungle destroyed Foreman... and propelled Ali onto a bigger stage. It was held in Zaire, rebels were fighting, the dictator Mobutu, Don King in his prime, James Brown, the succubus, the witch doctors, Boom-aye, Ali, Foreman... The world must have shaken that night. This documentary makes the hairs on the back of neck stand up... imagine what it must have been like to be alive at that time.

And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself. This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, "Rumble in the Jungle" could have been subtitled the "Ali show". The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign. And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation  and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. "When We Were Kings" provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty. Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match. How about the victory then? Well, I guess my "what if" questions were unthinkable in Ali's mind. It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while "When We Were Kings" is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

    When We Were Kings (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely entertaining, Oscar-winning documentary covering the 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, which became known as the Rumble in the Jungle. Through interview footage as well as archival footage, director Leon Gast's film perfectly documents the historic match and everything leading up to it. The boxing match itself is legendary and something most people know about and it's perfectly shown here but I think the real key to the documentary is everything we're shown leading up to the fight. This, of course, includes a lot of stuff dealing with Ali trash talking and getting involved with the African people. There are several scenes where Ali is simply out in the streets working out and trying to pump up the African people and of course get them in his corner. By contrast, we then see interview segments with Foreman where he's obviously not as deeply in with the people and doesn't have the same connection that Ali does. One really gets a great idea of the political climate heading up to the fight and the stuff with Ali training and just being himself are truly priceless. It's also fun hearing about how his career was thought to have been on the low-end as everyone was thinking that Foreman would destroy and possibly kill him in the ring. When we finally get to the fight footage it's presented in such a way that you really see what Ali was going for and how he pulled the upset. We see some terrific footage that is broken down and we're shown every little point that helped get Ali the win. WHEN WE WERE KINGS shows a historic fight and the surroundings around it and you can't help but be thankful that such an important event was captured in such a great form.

    The story of Muhammed Ali and the famous "Rumble in the Jungle" is the stuff of legend; the world's best boxer becomes a hate figure for middle America and is banned for political reasons; he returns but has lost his edge; he gets a last shot at the world title in a fight to be held in Zaire, whose kleptomaniac dictator is willing to put up his people's cash to pay for it; and against all the odds, he astonishingly beats the superior puncher George Foreman through a combination of wit and bravery. Ali was beautiful and clever as well as violent; his "art" destroyed him, but it's easy to tell his story as a kind of noble myth. Which is exactly what 'When We Were Kings', a documentary that relies relatively little on talking heads (because the whole drama was a kind of performance, and filmed) does. The film even gets its soundtrack for free thanks to the musicians brought in to publicise the fight. I don't even like boxing, but it's still a compelling story; but also watch 'Thrilla in Manilla', a film about Ali's next fight, for a story that takes something of the gloss of his personal sheen.

    I don't believe the film is as flawed as some of the previous reviewers have stated. The footage was all from the early 70's and in that sense this is truly a film of it's time. This is a time and a place that doesn't exist any more, and even Zaire doesn't really exist anymore, its now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When Ali and Foreman fought it was a dictatorship under Mobutu, who wanted a spectacular sporting event held in his country. For me, the musicians, and the black culture elements are nothing more than an interesting backdrop of a superbly talented athlete trying to overcome almost insurmountable odds. Again and again we are reminded of the lack of belief in the Ali camp as Foreman destroyed one heavy bag after another. The key moment of the film for me can almost (but not totally) be encapsulated in Norman Mailer's anecdote at the end of the first round, where he claims he could see Ali looking within himself, and slowly concluding that this was THE moment in his life. Ali was standing in a ring with a man he knew he could not bully, who was stronger than him, could hit harder than he could, and was as determined to force his will on Ali as Ali was determined to do likewise. There is no purer moment of epiphany captured in any documentary I have yet seen. Here was a man out-gunned in almost every department, who with a combination of pure skill, guile, determination, athletic prowess and self belief, managed to overcome a ferocious and worthy opponent. Foreman cannot go without mention. Every David needs his Goliath. He was awesome in ability and dignified in manner. He had destroyed both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in spectacular fashion in the eighteen months before this fight and was at the top of his game. People would do well to remember Foreman was still knocking people out until 1997, when he KO'd Lou Savarese in the 12th round. They surely don't make 'em like they used to. Nobody except Ali believed he could overcome such an opponent. And what the documentary reveals to us is that in his darker moments, even he had doubts. He did not, however, let them stand in his way. This documentary is absolutely inspirational in almost every department. The fact that Ali was also a man of the people and recognised the dignity of African's in spite of their grinding poverty adds yet another dimension to this wonderful film, and to the man himself. As George Plimpton so concisely said "My God, the man's a politician too!" A truly great film , about a spectacular moment frozen in time, and a truly great leading man in Ali. I cannot close without commenting on the effect this loss had on Foreman. It hurt him deeply, and there is no one more pleased than I that he came back and shook the world a second time many years later.

    Now, the file can be viewed as a History, a bit of Politics, good sweet, natural African music and of course one Great Boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Foreman, (while millions & millions of Ali fans chanting his name "... Ali...Bumbaye, ... Ali...Bumbaye" (meanign Ali, Kill him)). Did I forgot to mention, entertaining performance by the Great Muhammad Ali!! Well, it is Entertaining, as far as I know Muhammad Ali(of course I have limited knowledge in boxing or in any other field.) was a calm guy, who only knows Boxing & till now thought that Mike Tyson was the only great. But when I saw this movie, I came to know Muhammad Ali not only as a Great Boxer, but also, as a man who can talk on various subjects, a political and a African leader and as a Man with a cause & of course as a great Entertainer. Why I brought Mike Tyson name in an Ali's Documentary review! Well, to compare one great we need another, Mike Tyson was a great Boxer, a street kid, who fought many fights & won many matches because in coach Cus D'Amado told him to do so... & of course he won them in Style, but after his mentor & coach's demise, he talk a clear direction & purpose. When it comes to Ali, he fought & won for his community with a Noble cause, I guess at that time African countries were ruled by European Colonies, and Black people were treated there as slave and so does in US where they were discriminated, Ali Fought for Black Pride, he wanted to show his people that there are second to none in this world, he wanted them to fight for their cause and the freedom of their countries from Europeans. I read many reviews of Hoop dreams, and has to watch it, I guess this documentary will be comparable to that & it should be Ali Dreams, Ali dreamt & told the world that he is the Greatest, many did not believe at that time when a young Guy told so, but Ali proved what he meant & showed the world his Dream, I guess they all came true. So, as a Pack this movie(Documentary) got it all a bit of history, music, politics, sport & of course loads of Entertainment.

    Inspiring, amazing true story of Ali's comeback/retirement fight against George Foreman. Leon Gast, with help from Taylor Hackford, has taken the times, the black cause, and two giants of boxing and fashioned a fascinating narrative and an insightful culture study of a nation and its people. It's true the material is to die for, but Gast knew just what to do with it. I am no boxing fan, and consider the sport uncultured and physically dangerous, yet I was glued to this doco from start to finish. Especially insightful were the comments from the then fight writers, including Norman Mailer. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    This film should be made mandatory watching for all school children. Historically it covers the greatest sporting event of all time and at the same time chronicles the amazing man himself. The Champ is not just articulate and charismatic... he touched the hearts of all the oppressed people of the time. He was a poor mans champion... a ghetto superstar. I wasn't alive at the time, but the film portrays brilliantly what an underdog Ali was and how everyone half expected Foreman to kill him. Then it shows how Ali very cleverly outwitted his opponent. Psychologically Ali was a heavyweight and Foreman a lightweight. With heart and determination he overcame the colossus that was Foreman. Watching Foreman in this documentary and his awesome power... I don't believe any boxer since has had the punching power of this man. For god sake he came back at 45 and won the title! Imagine what he was like at 20. The Rumble in the Jungle destroyed Foreman... and propelled Ali onto a bigger stage. It was held in Zaire, rebels were fighting, the dictator Mobutu, Don King in his prime, James Brown, the succubus, the witch doctors, Boom-aye, Ali, Foreman... The world must have shaken that night. This documentary makes the hairs on the back of neck stand up... imagine what it must have been like to be alive at that time.

    The fight between Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay and George Foreman in Zaire. The fight was nicknamed the rumble in the jungle. The documentary follows Ali and Foreman. It also has insight from writers and witnesses, Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and African American film director, Spike Lee, who later directed the film, "Ali." This documentary is a rare treasure that captures history, culture, and relationships. Ali is the underdog in the ring against Foreman on October 30, 1974. The outcome is remarkable as is the story behind both fighters. Ali is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa. He was proud to see Africans who flew, lived, and governed their own country. Sadly, Ali isn't well with Parkinsons. The disease has crippled his voice but not his message in recent years. The documentary is historical for so many reasons.

    To anyone born after Muhammad Ali's heyday as a boxer, it would be difficult to describe the impact he had on American life and culture. Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. "When We Were Kings" is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like "When Ali Was King", even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman. Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country. Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with. Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.

    This is the Oscar winning documentary about the legendary boxing bout between Muhammad Ali, the challenger and George Foreman, who was the reigning world heavy weight boxing champion of the time. The match became popular as "Rumble in the Jungle". it was held at Kinshasa, Zaire. Both the fighters were blacks. However, Ali was revered as a demi-God because he had spoken about the atrocities which the African Americans were facing in the US and had refused to go and fight in Vietnam. He was considered a true representative of the blacks. George Foreman, as the documentary says, was "blacker than Ali". But still he was taken as the white devil incarnate. The match was promoted by Don King. the President of Zaire decided to give the financial rewards to the fighters as he planned to use the bout to promote his country and his despotic rule. the build up to the fight and then the fight itself have been captured perfectly. there are glimpses about Ali's interaction with the citizens of Zaire who constantly urge him to "Ali, Boma Ye" which means "Ali, Kill Him". The movie is very gripping and shows the human face of the Gods of the Gloves. Two thumbs up.

    While watching "When We Were Kings", I was distracted by many "what if" questions: "what if Foreman had won that match in Zaire?" "What if Ali had lost?" "What if it was a flop?" etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start. And "Rumble in the Jungle" is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice. And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit: self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning: anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast  but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend. One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated: "No Vietcong ever called me a N-word". Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes: more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing: that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself. This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, "Rumble in the Jungle" could have been subtitled the "Ali show". The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign.

Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match.

Well, it is Entertaining, as far as I know Muhammad Ali(of course I have limited knowledge in boxing or in any other field.) was a calm guy, who only knows Boxing & till now thought that Mike Tyson was the only great. But when I saw this movie, I came to know Muhammad Ali not only as a Great Boxer, but also, as a man who can talk on various subjects, a political and a African leader and as a Man with a cause & of course as a great Entertainer. Why I brought Mike Tyson name in an Ali's Documentary review! Well, to compare one great we need another, Mike Tyson was a great Boxer, a street kid, who fought many fights & won many matches because in coach Cus D'Amado told him to do so... & of course he won them in Style, but after his mentor & coach's demise, he talk a clear direction & purpose. When it comes to Ali, he fought & won for his community with a Noble cause, I guess at that time African countries were ruled by European Colonies, and Black people were treated there as slave and so does in US where they were discriminated, Ali Fought for Black Pride, he wanted to show his people that there are second to none in this world, he wanted them to fight for their cause and the freedom of their countries from Europeans. I read many reviews of Hoop dreams, and has to watch it, I guess this documentary will be comparable to that & it should be Ali Dreams, Ali dreamt & told the world that he is the Greatest, many did not believe at that time when a young Guy told so, but Ali proved what he meant & showed the world his Dream, I guess they all came true. So, as a Pack this movie(Documentary) got it all a bit of history, music, politics, sport & of course loads of Entertainment.

    Inspiring, amazing true story of Ali's comeback/retirement fight against George Foreman. Leon Gast, with help from Taylor Hackford, has taken the times, the black cause, and two giants of boxing and fashioned a fascinating narrative and an insightful culture study of a nation and its people. It's true the material is to die for, but Gast knew just what to do with it. I am no boxing fan, and consider the sport uncultured and physically dangerous, yet I was glued to this doco from start to finish. Especially insightful were the comments from the then fight writers, including Norman Mailer. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    This film should be made mandatory watching for all school children. Historically it covers the greatest sporting event of all time and at the same time chronicles the amazing man himself. The Champ is not just articulate and charismatic... he touched the hearts of all the oppressed people of the time. He was a poor mans champion... a ghetto superstar. I wasn't alive at the time, but the film portrays brilliantly what an underdog Ali was and how everyone half expected Foreman to kill him. Then it shows how Ali very cleverly outwitted his opponent. Psychologically Ali was a heavyweight and Foreman a lightweight. With heart and determination he overcame the colossus that was Foreman. Watching Foreman in this documentary and his awesome power... I don't believe any boxer since has had the punching power of this man. For god sake he came back at 45 and won the title! Imagine what he was like at 20. The Rumble in the Jungle destroyed Foreman... and propelled Ali onto a bigger stage. It was held in Zaire, rebels were fighting, the dictator Mobutu, Don King in his prime, James Brown, the succubus, the witch doctors, Boom-aye, Ali, Foreman... The world must have shaken that night. This documentary makes the hairs on the back of neck stand up... imagine what it must have been like to be alive at that time.

    The fight between Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay and George Foreman in Zaire. The fight was nicknamed the rumble in the jungle. The documentary follows Ali and Foreman. It also has insight from writers and witnesses, Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and African American film director, Spike Lee, who later directed the film, "Ali." This documentary is a rare treasure that captures history, culture, and relationships. Ali is the underdog in the ring against Foreman on October 30, 1974. The outcome is remarkable as is the story behind both fighters. Ali is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa. He was proud to see Africans who flew, lived, and governed their own country. Sadly, Ali isn't well with Parkinsons. The disease has crippled his voice but not his message in recent years. The documentary is historical for so many reasons.

    To anyone born after Muhammad Ali's heyday as a boxer, it would be difficult to describe the impact he had on American life and culture. Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. "When We Were Kings" is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like "When Ali Was King", even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman. Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country. Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with. Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.

    This is the Oscar winning documentary about the legendary boxing bout between Muhammad Ali, the challenger and George Foreman, who was the reigning world heavy weight boxing champion of the time. The match became popular as "Rumble in the Jungle". it was held at Kinshasa, Zaire. Both the fighters were blacks. However, Ali was revered as a demi-God because he had spoken about the atrocities which the African Americans were facing in the US and had refused to go and fight in Vietnam. He was considered a true representative of the blacks. George Foreman, as the documentary says, was "blacker than Ali". But still he was taken as the white devil incarnate. The match was promoted by Don King. the President of Zaire decided to give the financial rewards to the fighters as he planned to use the bout to promote his country and his despotic rule. the build up to the fight and then the fight itself have been captured perfectly. there are glimpses about Ali's interaction with the citizens of Zaire who constantly urge him to "Ali, Boma Ye" which means "Ali, Kill Him". The movie is very gripping and shows the human face of the Gods of the Gloves. Two thumbs up.

    While watching "When We Were Kings", I was distracted by many "what if" questions: "what if Foreman had won that match in Zaire?" "What if Ali had lost?" "What if it was a flop?" etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start. And "Rumble in the Jungle" is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice. And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit: self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning: anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast  but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend. One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated: "No Vietcong ever called me a N-word". Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes: more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing: that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself. This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, "Rumble in the Jungle" could have been subtitled the "Ali show". The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign. And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation  and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. "When We Were Kings" provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty. Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match. How about the victory then? Well, I guess my "what if" questions were unthinkable in Ali's mind. It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while "When We Were Kings" is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

    When We Were Kings (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely entertaining, Oscar-winning documentary covering the 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, which became known as the Rumble in the Jungle. Through interview footage as well as archival footage, director Leon Gast's film perfectly documents the historic match and everything leading up to it. The boxing match itself is legendary and something most people know about and it's perfectly shown here but I think the real key to the documentary is everything we're shown leading up to the fight. This, of course, includes a lot of stuff dealing with Ali trash talking and getting involved with the African people. There are several scenes where Ali is simply out in the streets working out and trying to pump up the African people and of course get them in his corner. By contrast, we then see interview segments with Foreman where he's obviously not as deeply in with the people and doesn't have the same connection that Ali does. One really gets a great idea of the political climate heading up to the fight and the stuff with Ali training and just being himself are truly priceless. It's also fun hearing about how his career was thought to have been on the low-end as everyone was thinking that Foreman would destroy and possibly kill him in the ring. When we finally get to the fight footage it's presented in such a way that you really see what Ali was going for and how he pulled the upset. We see some terrific footage that is broken down and we're shown every little point that helped get Ali the win. WHEN WE WERE KINGS shows a historic fight and the surroundings around it and you can't help but be thankful that such an important event was captured in such a great form.

    The story of Muhammed Ali and the famous "Rumble in the Jungle" is the stuff of legend; the world's best boxer becomes a hate figure for middle America and is banned for political reasons; he returns but has lost his edge; he gets a last shot at the world title in a fight to be held in Zaire, whose kleptomaniac dictator is willing to put up his people's cash to pay for it; and against all the odds, he astonishingly beats the superior puncher George Foreman through a combination of wit and bravery. Ali was beautiful and clever as well as violent; his "art" destroyed him, but it's easy to tell his story as a kind of noble myth. Which is exactly what 'When We Were Kings', a documentary that relies relatively little on talking heads (because the whole drama was a kind of performance, and filmed) does. The film even gets its soundtrack for free thanks to the musicians brought in to publicise the fight. I don't even like boxing, but it's still a compelling story; but also watch 'Thrilla in Manilla', a film about Ali's next fight, for a story that takes something of the gloss of his personal sheen.

    I don't believe the film is as flawed as some of the previous reviewers have stated. The footage was all from the early 70's and in that sense this is truly a film of it's time. This is a time and a place that doesn't exist any more, and even Zaire doesn't really exist anymore, its now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When Ali and Foreman fought it was a dictatorship under Mobutu, who wanted a spectacular sporting event held in his country. For me, the musicians, and the black culture elements are nothing more than an interesting backdrop of a superbly talented athlete trying to overcome almost insurmountable odds. Again and again we are reminded of the lack of belief in the Ali camp as Foreman destroyed one heavy bag after another. The key moment of the film for me can almost (but not totally) be encapsulated in Norman Mailer's anecdote at the end of the first round, where he claims he could see Ali looking within himself, and slowly concluding that this was THE moment in his life. Ali was standing in a ring with a man he knew he could not bully, who was stronger than him, could hit harder than he could, and was as determined to force his will on Ali as Ali was determined to do likewise. There is no purer moment of epiphany captured in any documentary I have yet seen. Here was a man out-gunned in almost every department, who with a combination of pure skill, guile, determination, athletic prowess and self belief, managed to overcome a ferocious and worthy opponent. Foreman cannot go without mention. Every David needs his Goliath. He was awesome in ability and dignified in manner. He had destroyed both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in spectacular fashion in the eighteen months before this fight and was at the top of his game. People would do well to remember Foreman was still knocking people out until 1997, when he KO'd Lou Savarese in the 12th round. They surely don't make 'em like they used to. Nobody except Ali believed he could overcome such an opponent. And what the documentary reveals to us is that in his darker moments, even he had doubts. He did not, however, let them stand in his way. This documentary is absolutely inspirational in almost every department. The fact that Ali was also a man of the people and recognised the dignity of African's in spite of their grinding poverty adds yet another dimension to this wonderful film, and to the man himself. As George Plimpton so concisely said "My God, the man's a politician too!" A truly great film , about a spectacular moment frozen in time, and a truly great leading man in Ali. I cannot close without commenting on the effect this loss had on Foreman. It hurt him deeply, and there is no one more pleased than I that he came back and shook the world a second time many years later.

"What if it was a flop?" etc. Cynically, I assumed that had Ali lost, the documentary wouldn't have been made, but then I remembered that it waited 22 years to be made, and receive the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1997. In other words, it wasn't supposed to 'make a film'; it was a legend from the very start. And "Rumble in the Jungle" is the nostalgic celebration of the most legendary episode of Boxing History, through a recollection of images and stories from those who witnessed the event. It's a treasure in terms of archive footage, musical sequences, and extraordinary shots of Ali haranguing his African fans and shining everyone with his unique charisma or Don King discussing the black condition with James Brown. The match is almost secondary while the film is more of a magnificent tribute to the enormous contribution of African American people in sport and entertainment. Some would think that the genius of people is better measured on fields such as science, medicine, physics, literature or politics, but in these times, sport and music was the most likely medium where African American people could express their voice. And sport is probably the noblest expression of Humanity's true spirit: self-accomplishment, victory and respect. While science and literature cruelly depend on the level of education one has received, sport is universal; it's no-money learning: anyone can develop physical abilities with his own will. In a world full of segregation, sport offers the less segregationist environment. While intelligence can be used to disguise ignorance, strength cannot disguise weakness, the strongest is the strongest. Boxing is probably the most straight-forward incarnation of the true essence of sport, and on that discipline, Muhammad Ali was the greatest, a sort of semi-God like figure who had to prove his physical strength, before it transcended the limits of the ring, even at the risk of becoming an unpopular figure, an outcast  but sometimes, it's this very status that paves the way to the legend. One has to remember how truly unpopular Ali became when he refused to fight in Vietnam. As recalls Spike Lee, interviewed in the documentary, it's not just the refusal but the way it was stated: "No Vietcong ever called me a N-word". Ali shouted what every member of his community was secretly thinking, he had the guts to refuse to be a government's puppet, he lost his Heavyweight Champion title and couldn't fight for several years, but what it cost him in sports, elevated him above all the other athletes: more than a spokesperson, he became a living icon, a myth and a model. Basically, his refusal taught people one thing: that one can't ask for respect if he doesn't respect himself. And the man who 'shook up the world' by defeating Sonny Liston had too much self-esteem to fight against people he's got nothing against just because he's told to do so. Respect starts with self-respect and even school can't teach you to respect yourself. This is why the documentary might be guilty of a certain bias toward Ali, but it doesn't denigrate Foreman either. He is the 'quiet yet invulnerable' force, a Fighting Machine that knocked out and dethroned Joe Frazier after a technical knock-out, but his lack of flamboyance and eccentricity allowed Ali to conquer the hearts of all the Zairian people. Basically, "Rumble in the Jungle" could have been subtitled the "Ali show". The film isn't pro-Ali or anti-Foreman, it even manages to draw a sort of retrospectively sympathetic portrait of 'Big George' who just couldn't outsize Ali, popularity-wise. An unfortunate irony is that even as a darker person, Foreman incarnated the 'White man' for the people, by arriving at the airport with a blonde shepherd, symbol of the previous Belgian colon. Misunderstood, Foreman also misunderstood the public, and the whole fight's symbolism, he showed as an African American man, while Ali was exalting the pride of the difference, this pride that started when he refused to assign. And this is exactly this pride of the difference that the film conveys through Ali's exuberant personality, even the title works like a slogan reminding that there was a time where Africa was the mother of humanity, when there was a pride to be Black, and people like Ali revived that pride. The film powerfully encapsulates the spirit within the black people in America or Africa, this 'Booma ye!' spirit ,where it was not about wanting to be 'assimilated', but to be 'respected'. Difference, not assimilation  and never had the Black pride been as authentic, as sincere, as expressed by Muhammad Ali, an equal of Nelson Mandela, Malcolm X and ironically to Patrice Lumumba who was ordered to be killed by the very President of Zaire, Mobutu himself. "When We Were Kings" provides an important slice of African life under dictatorship, proving that the people still had inner demons to exorcise, undermining the path to liberty. Nothing positive can be dictated by terror and beyond the whole show, orchestrated by Don King, Ali and Foreman were not there to express an antagonism, but to play a game, it was a performance. And the film, although trying sometimes to convey a false sense of suspense by depicting Ali as a challenger who had almost no chance to win -a theory contradicted by most boxing experts- the legend preceded the match. How about the victory then? Well, I guess my "what if" questions were unthinkable in Ali's mind. It's as if, as a Muslim, he believed that some things were like written by God (or Allah) himself wanted to make reality even more appealing as fiction. Indeed, while "When We Were Kings" is a documentary and a damn good one, I felt it as emotionally gripping as a fiction.

    When We Were Kings (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Extremely entertaining, Oscar-winning documentary covering the 1974 boxing match between Muhammad Ali and George Foreman, which became known as the Rumble in the Jungle. Through interview footage as well as archival footage, director Leon Gast's film perfectly documents the historic match and everything leading up to it. The boxing match itself is legendary and something most people know about and it's perfectly shown here but I think the real key to the documentary is everything we're shown leading up to the fight. This, of course, includes a lot of stuff dealing with Ali trash talking and getting involved with the African people. There are several scenes where Ali is simply out in the streets working out and trying to pump up the African people and of course get them in his corner. By contrast, we then see interview segments with Foreman where he's obviously not as deeply in with the people and doesn't have the same connection that Ali does. One really gets a great idea of the political climate heading up to the fight and the stuff with Ali training and just being himself are truly priceless. It's also fun hearing about how his career was thought to have been on the low-end as everyone was thinking that Foreman would destroy and possibly kill him in the ring. When we finally get to the fight footage it's presented in such a way that you really see what Ali was going for and how he pulled the upset. We see some terrific footage that is broken down and we're shown every little point that helped get Ali the win. WHEN WE WERE KINGS shows a historic fight and the surroundings around it and you can't help but be thankful that such an important event was captured in such a great form.

    The story of Muhammed Ali and the famous "Rumble in the Jungle" is the stuff of legend; the world's best boxer becomes a hate figure for middle America and is banned for political reasons; he returns but has lost his edge; he gets a last shot at the world title in a fight to be held in Zaire, whose kleptomaniac dictator is willing to put up his people's cash to pay for it; and against all the odds, he astonishingly beats the superior puncher George Foreman through a combination of wit and bravery. Ali was beautiful and clever as well as violent; his "art" destroyed him, but it's easy to tell his story as a kind of noble myth. Which is exactly what 'When We Were Kings', a documentary that relies relatively little on talking heads (because the whole drama was a kind of performance, and filmed) does. The film even gets its soundtrack for free thanks to the musicians brought in to publicise the fight. I don't even like boxing, but it's still a compelling story; but also watch 'Thrilla in Manilla', a film about Ali's next fight, for a story that takes something of the gloss of his personal sheen.

    I don't believe the film is as flawed as some of the previous reviewers have stated. The footage was all from the early 70's and in that sense this is truly a film of it's time. This is a time and a place that doesn't exist any more, and even Zaire doesn't really exist anymore, its now the Democratic Republic of the Congo. When Ali and Foreman fought it was a dictatorship under Mobutu, who wanted a spectacular sporting event held in his country. For me, the musicians, and the black culture elements are nothing more than an interesting backdrop of a superbly talented athlete trying to overcome almost insurmountable odds. Again and again we are reminded of the lack of belief in the Ali camp as Foreman destroyed one heavy bag after another. The key moment of the film for me can almost (but not totally) be encapsulated in Norman Mailer's anecdote at the end of the first round, where he claims he could see Ali looking within himself, and slowly concluding that this was THE moment in his life. Ali was standing in a ring with a man he knew he could not bully, who was stronger than him, could hit harder than he could, and was as determined to force his will on Ali as Ali was determined to do likewise. There is no purer moment of epiphany captured in any documentary I have yet seen. Here was a man out-gunned in almost every department, who with a combination of pure skill, guile, determination, athletic prowess and self belief, managed to overcome a ferocious and worthy opponent. Foreman cannot go without mention. Every David needs his Goliath. He was awesome in ability and dignified in manner. He had destroyed both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in spectacular fashion in the eighteen months before this fight and was at the top of his game. People would do well to remember Foreman was still knocking people out until 1997, when he KO'd Lou Savarese in the 12th round. They surely don't make 'em like they used to. Nobody except Ali believed he could overcome such an opponent. And what the documentary reveals to us is that in his darker moments, even he had doubts. He did not, however, let them stand in his way. This documentary is absolutely inspirational in almost every department. The fact that Ali was also a man of the people and recognised the dignity of African's in spite of their grinding poverty adds yet another dimension to this wonderful film, and to the man himself. As George Plimpton so concisely said "My God, the man's a politician too!" A truly great film , about a spectacular moment frozen in time, and a truly great leading man in Ali. I cannot close without commenting on the effect this loss had on Foreman. It hurt him deeply, and there is no one more pleased than I that he came back and shook the world a second time many years later.

    Now, the file can be viewed as a History, a bit of Politics, good sweet, natural African music and of course one Great Boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Foreman, (while millions & millions of Ali fans chanting his name "... Ali...Bumbaye, ... Ali...Bumbaye" (meanign Ali, Kill him)). Did I forgot to mention, entertaining performance by the Great Muhammad Ali!! Well, it is Entertaining, as far as I know Muhammad Ali(of course I have limited knowledge in boxing or in any other field.) was a calm guy, who only knows Boxing & till now thought that Mike Tyson was the only great. But when I saw this movie, I came to know Muhammad Ali not only as a Great Boxer, but also, as a man who can talk on various subjects, a political and a African leader and as a Man with a cause & of course as a great Entertainer. Why I brought Mike Tyson name in an Ali's Documentary review! Well, to compare one great we need another, Mike Tyson was a great Boxer, a street kid, who fought many fights & won many matches because in coach Cus D'Amado told him to do so... & of course he won them in Style, but after his mentor & coach's demise, he talk a clear direction & purpose. When it comes to Ali, he fought & won for his community with a Noble cause, I guess at that time African countries were ruled by European Colonies, and Black people were treated there as slave and so does in US where they were discriminated, Ali Fought for Black Pride, he wanted to show his people that there are second to none in this world, he wanted them to fight for their cause and the freedom of their countries from Europeans. I read many reviews of Hoop dreams, and has to watch it, I guess this documentary will be comparable to that & it should be Ali Dreams, Ali dreamt & told the world that he is the Greatest, many did not believe at that time when a young Guy told so, but Ali proved what he meant & showed the world his Dream, I guess they all came true. So, as a Pack this movie(Documentary) got it all a bit of history, music, politics, sport & of course loads of Entertainment.

    Inspiring, amazing true story of Ali's comeback/retirement fight against George Foreman. Leon Gast, with help from Taylor Hackford, has taken the times, the black cause, and two giants of boxing and fashioned a fascinating narrative and an insightful culture study of a nation and its people. It's true the material is to die for, but Gast knew just what to do with it. I am no boxing fan, and consider the sport uncultured and physically dangerous, yet I was glued to this doco from start to finish. Especially insightful were the comments from the then fight writers, including Norman Mailer. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    This film should be made mandatory watching for all school children. Historically it covers the greatest sporting event of all time and at the same time chronicles the amazing man himself. The Champ is not just articulate and charismatic... he touched the hearts of all the oppressed people of the time. He was a poor mans champion... a ghetto superstar. I wasn't alive at the time, but the film portrays brilliantly what an underdog Ali was and how everyone half expected Foreman to kill him. Then it shows how Ali very cleverly outwitted his opponent. Psychologically Ali was a heavyweight and Foreman a lightweight. With heart and determination he overcame the colossus that was Foreman. Watching Foreman in this documentary and his awesome power... I don't believe any boxer since has had the punching power of this man. For god sake he came back at 45 and won the title! Imagine what he was like at 20. The Rumble in the Jungle destroyed Foreman... and propelled Ali onto a bigger stage. It was held in Zaire, rebels were fighting, the dictator Mobutu, Don King in his prime, James Brown, the succubus, the witch doctors, Boom-aye, Ali, Foreman... The world must have shaken that night. This documentary makes the hairs on the back of neck stand up... imagine what it must have been like to be alive at that time.

    The fight between Muhammad Ali aka Cassius Clay and George Foreman in Zaire. The fight was nicknamed the rumble in the jungle. The documentary follows Ali and Foreman. It also has insight from writers and witnesses, Norman Mailer and George Plimpton, and African American film director, Spike Lee, who later directed the film, "Ali." This documentary is a rare treasure that captures history, culture, and relationships. Ali is the underdog in the ring against Foreman on October 30, 1974. The outcome is remarkable as is the story behind both fighters. Ali is proud of being an African American, honest, opinionated, and vocal about civil rights in America and in Africa. He was proud to see Africans who flew, lived, and governed their own country. Sadly, Ali isn't well with Parkinsons. The disease has crippled his voice but not his message in recent years. The documentary is historical for so many reasons.

    To anyone born after Muhammad Ali's heyday as a boxer, it would be difficult to describe the impact he had on American life and culture. Sure, one can read about it and watch other documentaries, but there's something to be said about experiencing it in real time with Ali's name in the headlines, proclaiming himself to be The Greatest both in and out of the ring. "When We Were Kings" is probably an inappropriate title for this film, it plays more like "When Ali Was King", even though he wasn't World Champ at the time, having been stripped of the title for refusing the military draft. The picture does a credible job of presenting the behind the scenes machinations to bring the 'Rumble in the Jungle' to fruition, even with a six week delay due to a training injury suffered by Foreman. Thinking back to those days, I had never considered the implications of making the fight a black political statement, though in hindsight I would question allowing the involvement of a dictator like Mobutu Sese Seko putting up the money for the event. As described by Norman Mailer, one of the writers interviewed for the film, Mobutu was a closet sadist who rounded up a thousand criminals and put them in detention pens underneath the fight stadium to remove the threat of criminal activity while the eyes of the world were on his country. Don't expect to see a lot of the eight round fight in this documentary. What you need to know is capably explained by Mailer and fellow sportswriter George Plimpton laying out Ali's strategy and how he approached the fight. Mailer's analysis in particular is helpful in detailing how Ali's right hand leads so enraged Foreman that he used up a lot of his power and energy in trying to destroy him. Quite honestly though, I don't know quite what to make of the 'succubus' story that Plimpton seemed to be so fascinated with. Perhaps the most significant take away I had from the picture was hearing Spike Lee's comments that had nothing to do with the fight. He was speaking of black youth, but I would ascribe his remarks to all colors of a young generation today that remain completely unaware of history, and even worse, are disinterested in learning about it. Most certainly, Muhammad Ali would have something to say about that.

    This is the Oscar winning documentary about the legendary boxing bout between Muhammad Ali, the challenger and George Foreman, who was the reigning world heavy weight boxing champion of the time. The match became popular as "Rumble in the Jungle". it was held at Kinshasa, Zaire. Both the fighters were blacks. However, Ali was revered as a demi-God because he had spoken about the atrocities which the African Americans were facing in the US and had refused to go and fight in Vietnam. He was considered a true representative of the blacks. George Foreman, as the documentary says, was "blacker than Ali". But still he was taken as the white devil incarnate. The match was promoted by Don King. the President of Zaire decided to give the financial rewards to the fighters as he planned to use the bout to promote his country and his despotic rule. the build up to the fight and then the fight itself have been captured perfectly. there are glimpses about Ali's interaction with the citizens of Zaire who constantly urge him to "Ali, Boma Ye" which means "Ali, Kill Him". The movie is very gripping and shows the human face of the Gods of the Gloves. Two thumbs up.

Here was a man out-gunned in almost every department, who with a combination of pure skill, guile, determination, athletic prowess and self belief, managed to overcome a ferocious and worthy opponent. Foreman cannot go without mention. Every David needs his Goliath. He was awesome in ability and dignified in manner. He had destroyed both Joe Frazier and Ken Norton in spectacular fashion in the eighteen months before this fight and was at the top of his game. People would do well to remember Foreman was still knocking people out until 1997, when he KO'd Lou Savarese in the 12th round. They surely don't make 'em like they used to. Nobody except Ali believed he could overcome such an opponent. And what the documentary reveals to us is that in his darker moments, even he had doubts. He did not, however, let them stand in his way. This documentary is absolutely inspirational in almost every department. The fact that Ali was also a man of the people and recognised the dignity of African's in spite of their grinding poverty adds yet another dimension to this wonderful film, and to the man himself. As George Plimpton so concisely said "My God, the man's a politician too!" A truly great film , about a spectacular moment frozen in time, and a truly great leading man in Ali. I cannot close without commenting on the effect this loss had on Foreman. It hurt him deeply, and there is no one more pleased than I that he came back and shook the world a second time many years later.

    Now, the file can be viewed as a History, a bit of Politics, good sweet, natural African music and of course one Great Boxing match between Muhammad Ali and Foreman, (while millions & millions of Ali fans chanting his name "... Ali...Bumbaye, ... Ali...Bumbaye" (meanign Ali, Kill him)). Did I forgot to mention, entertaining performance by the Great Muhammad Ali!! Well, it is Entertaining, as far as I know Muhammad Ali(of course I have limited knowledge in boxing or in any other field.) was a calm guy, who only knows Boxing & till now thought that Mike Tyson was the only great. But when I saw this movie, I came to know Muhammad Ali not only as a Great Boxer, but also, as a man who can talk on various subjects, a political and a African leader and as a Man with a cause & of course as a great Entertainer. Why I brought Mike Tyson name in an Ali's Documentary review! Well, to compare one great we need another, Mike Tyson was a great Boxer, a street kid, who fought many fights & won many matches because in coach Cus D'Amado told him to do so... & of course he won them in Style, but after his mentor & coach's demise, he talk a clear direction & purpose. When it comes to Ali, he fought & won for his community with a Noble cause, I guess at that time African countries were ruled by European Colonies, and Black people were treated there as slave and so does in US where they were discriminated, Ali Fought for Black Pride, he wanted to show his people that there are second to none in this world, he wanted them to fight for their cause and the freedom of their countries from Europeans. I read many reviews of Hoop dreams, and has to watch it, I guess this documentary will be comparable to that & it should be Ali Dreams, Ali dreamt & told the world that he is the Greatest, many did not believe at that time when a young Guy told so, but Ali proved what he meant & showed the world his Dream, I guess they all came true. So, as a Pack this movie(Documentary) got it all a bit of history, music, politics, sport & of course loads of Entertainment.

    Inspiring, amazing true story of Ali's comeback/retirement fight against George Foreman. Leon Gast, with help from Taylor Hackford, has taken the times, the black cause, and two giants of boxing and fashioned a fascinating narrative and an insightful culture study of a nation and its people. It's true the material is to die for, but Gast knew just what to do with it. I am no boxing fan, and consider the sport uncultured and physically dangerous, yet I was glued to this doco from start to finish. Especially insightful were the comments from the then fight writers, including Norman Mailer. Saturday, June 26, 1999 - Video

    This film should be made mandatory watching for all school children. Historically it covers the greatest sporting event of all time and at the same time chronicles the amazing man himself. The Champ is not just articulate and charismatic... he touched the hearts of all the oppressed people of the time. He was a poor mans champion... a ghetto superstar. I wasn't alive at the time, but the film portrays brilliantly what an underdog Ali was and how everyone half expected Foreman to kill him. Then it shows how Ali very cleverly outwitted his opponent. Psychologically Ali was a heavyweight and Foreman a lightweight. With heart and determination he overcame the colossus that was Foreman. Watching Foreman in this documentary and his awesome power... I don't believe any boxer since has had the punching power of this man. For god sake he came back at 45 and won the title! Imagine what he was like at 20. The Rumble in the Jungle destroyed Foreman... and propelled Ali onto a bigger stage. It was held in Zaire, rebels were fighting, the dictator Mobutu, Don King in his prime, James Brown, the succubus, the witch doctors, Boom-aye, Ali, Foreman... The world must have shaken that night. This documentary makes the hairs on the back of neck stand up... imagine what it must have been like to be alive at that time.
