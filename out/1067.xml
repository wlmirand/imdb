 <sinopse>
  Focusing on a trio of friends and their elaborate plan to pull off a simple robbery and go on the run.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Upon his release from a mental hospital following a nervous breakdown, the directionless Anthony joins his friend Dignan, who seems far less sane than the former. Dignan has hatched a hare-brained scheme for an as-yet-unspecified crime spree that somehow involves his former boss, the (supposedly) legendary Mr. Henry. With the help of their pathetic neighbor and pal Bob, Anthony and Dignan pull a job and hit the road, where Anthony finds love with motel maid Inez. When our boys finally hook up with Mr. Henry, the ensuing escapade turns out to be far from what anyone expected.

    Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations. Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

    Time to time watching complex film plots, narration patterns, and abstractness it is better to watch a simple film sometimes. They act like a dessert after a long twisting experience for the brain. Bottle rocket is one such film. The plot is very simple. The characters are funny. We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also. The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show. VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.

    I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as "The Royal Tannenbaums" and "Moonrise Kingdom". Some I did not like--such as "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander. So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film. By the way, "Bottle Rocket" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

    Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived. The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and "Bottle Rocket", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming. Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

    This is the debut movie of the king of quirky comedies, Wes Anderson. It is a story of three friends(the Wilson brothers and Bob Musgrave). Luke has just checked himself out from a psychiatric clinic. He joins Owen and Bob and begins preparing for a heist. In the meantime he falls in love and ultimately backs out from the plan. Superbly scripted, this is full of comic punches delivered in a great dead pan style by the actors. Owen Wilson easily takes the acting honors. He has one of the most innocent faces of tinsel town and when he utters the absurdities and the obscenities, you howl out loudly. The characters are quirky. A must watch for the Anderson fans. 3.5 out of 5.

    The heist theme keeps this movie mildly interesting, but these characters' existences are so miserable and unfunny that sitting through an hour and a half of this was almost unbearable. Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film. In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: "After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him." He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters. Oo-rah.

    The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well. The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.

    The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director. We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before. After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three "go on the lam" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over. One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film. Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, "Who dat man?" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things! Howsabout you? Are you in?

As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, "Who dat man?" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things! Howsabout you? Are you in?

    Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations. Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

    Time to time watching complex film plots, narration patterns, and abstractness it is better to watch a simple film sometimes. They act like a dessert after a long twisting experience for the brain. Bottle rocket is one such film. The plot is very simple. The characters are funny. We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also. The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show. VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.

    I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as "The Royal Tannenbaums" and "Moonrise Kingdom". Some I did not like--such as "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander. So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film. By the way, "Bottle Rocket" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

    Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived. The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and "Bottle Rocket", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming. Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

    This is the debut movie of the king of quirky comedies, Wes Anderson. It is a story of three friends(the Wilson brothers and Bob Musgrave). Luke has just checked himself out from a psychiatric clinic. He joins Owen and Bob and begins preparing for a heist. In the meantime he falls in love and ultimately backs out from the plan. Superbly scripted, this is full of comic punches delivered in a great dead pan style by the actors. Owen Wilson easily takes the acting honors. He has one of the most innocent faces of tinsel town and when he utters the absurdities and the obscenities, you howl out loudly. The characters are quirky. A must watch for the Anderson fans. 3.5 out of 5.

    The heist theme keeps this movie mildly interesting, but these characters' existences are so miserable and unfunny that sitting through an hour and a half of this was almost unbearable. Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film. In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: "After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him." He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters. Oo-rah.

    The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well. The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.

    The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director. We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before. After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three "go on the lam" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over. One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film. Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, "Who dat man?" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things! Howsabout you? Are you in?

    Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations. Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

    Time to time watching complex film plots, narration patterns, and abstractness it is better to watch a simple film sometimes. They act like a dessert after a long twisting experience for the brain. Bottle rocket is one such film. The plot is very simple. The characters are funny. We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also. The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show. VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.

    I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as "The Royal Tannenbaums" and "Moonrise Kingdom". Some I did not like--such as "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander. So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film. By the way, "Bottle Rocket" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

    Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived. The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and "Bottle Rocket", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming. Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

    This is the debut movie of the king of quirky comedies, Wes Anderson. It is a story of three friends(the Wilson brothers and Bob Musgrave). Luke has just checked himself out from a psychiatric clinic. He joins Owen and Bob and begins preparing for a heist. In the meantime he falls in love and ultimately backs out from the plan. Superbly scripted, this is full of comic punches delivered in a great dead pan style by the actors. Owen Wilson easily takes the acting honors. He has one of the most innocent faces of tinsel town and when he utters the absurdities and the obscenities, you howl out loudly. The characters are quirky. A must watch for the Anderson fans. 3.5 out of 5.

    The heist theme keeps this movie mildly interesting, but these characters' existences are so miserable and unfunny that sitting through an hour and a half of this was almost unbearable. Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film. In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: "After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him." He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters. Oo-rah.

    The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well. The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.

    The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director. We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before. After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three "go on the lam" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over. One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film. Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film. Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations. Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

    Time to time watching complex film plots, narration patterns, and abstractness it is better to watch a simple film sometimes. They act like a dessert after a long twisting experience for the brain. Bottle rocket is one such film. The plot is very simple. The characters are funny. We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also. The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show. VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.

    I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as "The Royal Tannenbaums" and "Moonrise Kingdom". Some I did not like--such as "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander. So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film. By the way, "Bottle Rocket" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

    Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived. The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and "Bottle Rocket", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming. Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

    This is the debut movie of the king of quirky comedies, Wes Anderson. It is a story of three friends(the Wilson brothers and Bob Musgrave). Luke has just checked himself out from a psychiatric clinic. He joins Owen and Bob and begins preparing for a heist. In the meantime he falls in love and ultimately backs out from the plan. Superbly scripted, this is full of comic punches delivered in a great dead pan style by the actors. Owen Wilson easily takes the acting honors. He has one of the most innocent faces of tinsel town and when he utters the absurdities and the obscenities, you howl out loudly. The characters are quirky. A must watch for the Anderson fans. 3.5 out of 5.

    The heist theme keeps this movie mildly interesting, but these characters' existences are so miserable and unfunny that sitting through an hour and a half of this was almost unbearable. Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film. In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: "After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him." He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters. Oo-rah.

    The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well. The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.

    The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director. We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before. After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three "go on the lam" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over. One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film. Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, "Who dat man?" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things! Howsabout you? Are you in?

Digan (Owen Wilson) rescues (but not really, he was getting out anyway) Anthony (Luke Wilson) from a psychiatric unit and Digan shows his plan of being involved in heists and building an entire life plan from there. The entire movie doesn't actually have much of a plot. In fact, it reminded me of a movie like Slacker directed by Richard Linklater, except unlike Slacker, this movie involved all of the same characters being involved in conversations about a whole lot of nothing where as Slacker involved multiple people in random conversations. Owen and Luke Wilson definitely play there roles with some charisma and are fairly entertaining but the writing itselfis just kind of boring. The humor was lacking. I laughed here and there but it wasn't very often. And besides that, the plot is still so unbelievably empty. Barely anything happens up until the last 10 minutes which are arguably the most entertaining part of the film. The enjoyment of this film really depends on if you like the dialogue. For me, it kept me uninterested most of the time except the occasional peak moments of humor and the charisma from the actors. Spiced throughout the film, you notice Anderson's beginnings of his style from his music choices, some of his camera choices, amongst other things which was nice to see as a fan of some of his movies. Overall, I'd consider this a film a bit of a disappoint but I can't say I full-on hated it, it was an oddly relaxing film to watch, maybe due to its simplicity even if it is much too simple.

    Time to time watching complex film plots, narration patterns, and abstractness it is better to watch a simple film sometimes. They act like a dessert after a long twisting experience for the brain. Bottle rocket is one such film. The plot is very simple. The characters are funny. We have seen them countless times in many films. The film gives you sweet comedy which is sure to tickle your bone. The comedy is situational. Nothing is forced in terms of plot or actions by the characters. It is just the way things are happening to them which are shown happening very naturally. I have come across a number of comedy types and still I find this type involving silly characters who look normal, act natural and desperate to achieve something but somehow things never work for them. They never understand that also. The plot of the film revolves around three main characters, two of whom are just out from a mental hospital (but cured) and plan to attempt several robberies. The characters are natural, trying their best to do live life properly. Their plans are not hard core and neither is the difficulty too much. What the story focus is on their way of handling things which is way too amateurish and that's where the fun lies. This is one of the memorable roles for Owen Wilson and he without doubt steals the show. VERDICT: "A recommended watch."

    In this debut feature of the writing team of Anderson and Owen Wilson, friends go on a crime spree. This started as a short and it does feel like too little material stretched too thin. Many good comedies are quirky. Quirky can be good. Quirky can be funny. Quirky doesn't work if it has to work by itself. It's obvious from the situations and the characters that this is meant to be a comedy, but there's hardly a chuckle to be had here. It's quirk without humor. At least the actors are trying hard. Whatever his failings as a writer, Owen Wilson brings a lot of energy to his role, and brother Luke is likable here, but it's not enough. It's light-hearted, but it's also lame.

    I have seen several of Wes Anderson's films and think they certainly are NOT for all tastes. Some I really liked--such as "The Royal Tannenbaums" and "Moonrise Kingdom". Some I did not like--such as "The Life Aquatic With Steve Zissou". But one thing these films all have in common is a very slow (glacially slow) pace and very, very quirky characters and dialog. Because of that, it might be worth seeing this film simply because there ain't anything like it! The film has a plot but doesn't really get to it until the last quarter of the film! Up until then, the plot just meanders very slowly and mostly consists of the Wilson brothers (Owen and Luke) doing lots of seemingly irrelevant things up until they go on a heist (such as a long and directionless road trip). This lack of direction certainly will annoy most viewers though the acting was quite nice. Eventually, the heist does take place and the film improves SIGNIFICANTLY. I liked how incredibly inept and stupid the robbery turned out to be. But, again, at times it also seemed to meander. So did I like the film? Well, I am not sure. SOME of it I liked and much of it seemed in need of editing. At least it gave me a chance to see Anderson's and the Wilson brothers' first full-length film. By the way, "Bottle Rocket" was originally a short film (1994). If you watch it, you can see a lot of the later feature and it is interesting to see how the short morphed into the full-length film.

    Two life-clumsy friends Anthony (Luke Wilson) and Dignam (Owen Wilson) venture into a joint bird-brained heist (starting their new career by robbing Dignam's mother). Anthony was recently released from an asylum after a nervous breakdown, but in truth seems to offer more justifiable claims to sanity. Nonetheless, despite reservations, Anthony agrees to assist Dignam in his ploys together with ultra-moronic neighbour and getaway driver Bob (Robert Musgrave). After a semi-successful steal the threesome decide to hide out in a roadside motel until the dust settles. There Anthony falls deeply for the non-English-speaking Mexican maid Inez (Lumi Cavazos), thus necessitating a rewrite to the hapless plans he has already conceived. The feature length debut is much of the what Wes Anderson has incorporated into his trademark career as the king of quirkiness. Despite several attempts and a watch of every Anderson movie conceivable his critical appeal remains a mystery to myself, and "Bottle Rocket", arguably the most chaotic and purposeless story from the director was an undeniable torment to watch. With the whole middle of the story a misplaced filler, which attempts to expand the same-titled short film into a feature, the whole affair is tiresome, only really catching fire in the first and in the final act. Overall watchable for the first 30 minutes, afterwards the shenanigans at the motel with absolutely no focus derail any construed interest in the premise. Not intent on heading anywhere Anderson basically offers a collage of laid back quirky individuals trying to eek out a laugh, instead increasingly causing the Wilson brothers to become irritatingly overwhelming. Without much more on offer than odd-balls and oddities this is Wes Anderson's worst movie, which won't win over any of his doubters, who are best to look for other of his works to decide on whether Anderson's trademark quirk-attacks are 'no-no' or 'gung-ho'. For me personally the achingly convention subversive capers, the indulgent humour and the goofy character construction on offer by Anderson are extremely outside of my wavelengths.

    This is the debut movie of the king of quirky comedies, Wes Anderson. It is a story of three friends(the Wilson brothers and Bob Musgrave). Luke has just checked himself out from a psychiatric clinic. He joins Owen and Bob and begins preparing for a heist. In the meantime he falls in love and ultimately backs out from the plan. Superbly scripted, this is full of comic punches delivered in a great dead pan style by the actors. Owen Wilson easily takes the acting honors. He has one of the most innocent faces of tinsel town and when he utters the absurdities and the obscenities, you howl out loudly. The characters are quirky. A must watch for the Anderson fans. 3.5 out of 5.

    The heist theme keeps this movie mildly interesting, but these characters' existences are so miserable and unfunny that sitting through an hour and a half of this was almost unbearable. Also, the soundtrack did not appeal to me, and it was over-played throughout the film. In light of today being the Marine Corps Birthday, I found this bit of IMDb trivia interesting, as well: "After the movie bombed at the box office, Owen Wilson seriously considered joining the Marines, convinced that acting held no future for him." He may have missed out on some good money, but he would have gained a whole set of awesome skills and a band of badass brothers & sisters. Oo-rah.

    The Wilsons have their typical roles/characters: losers with big mouth, neurotic actions and unrealistic hopes. You start to feel sorry for them in many ways as - in spite of being small-scale crooks - they are not mean or evil. Small people try to do something big and solve their problems, but they create additional ones in turn - and for others as well. The plot has its interesting twists, the developments are quite slow - and do not expect to have good laughs. In some ways, it reminded me several Woody Allen's movies. Not so deep and profound, but more interesting, however.

    The story of Wes Anderson's Bottle Rocket goes a little something like this. Anderson shot a thirteen minute short film, featuring the three leads of this picture, showed it at Sundance, got the attention of filmmaker James L. Brooks, and he was one of the seven producers on the film adaptation of the short. While a box office failure, the picture launched the reputations of both Luke and Owen Wilson as actors and Wes Anderson has an eclectic director. We are taken to the upper-class Texas suburbs where Dignan (Owen Wilson) breaks his brother Anthony (Wilson) out of a mental hospital, and plan to conduct a series of elaborate heists with their friend Bob (Musgrave). Their goal is to challenge life in suburbia and rebel against the norms of recurring, everyday life. Haven't we heard that before. After they stage a pitiful robbery at a bookstore, the three "go on the lam" at a hotel. While there, Anthony meets and falls in love with a housekeeper named Ines (Cavazos), and Dignan fears that with Bob's continued incompetence and lack of loyalty, along with Anthony's lovestruck ways that their dreams of being robbers are over. One thing I was immediately impressed with was the warm look Bottle Rocket accompanies throughout its runtime. It's common to have a layer of cynicism in movies, but it seems that Wes Anderson's directorial effort is determined to fine the whimsicality of movies, the softness of their appearance, and the overall genial aspect of film itself. In short, the film always looks crisp and gentle. Not to mention, the actors are all flavorful, with both the Wilson brothers giving rather memorable performances, and the late appearance of James Caan is a pretty nice addition to the film. Though some marginally convincing performances, warmth, and identifiable whimsicality can not entirely elevate a picture, and that is where Anderson's Bottle Rocket flounders. It's so thin and trudges through its ninety minute runtime at a sluggish pace. The dialog scenes are nice, but rather uninvolving, as we learn that these characters truly have no motives of robbing random places other than to be difficult and stand out. As a whole, the film starts off slow, becomes vaguely amusing for a brief amount of time, before the experience ends and the whole thing is quickly forgotten. Sort of like a bottle rocket itself. Starring: Luke Wilson, Owen Wilson, Robert Musgrave, Lumi Cavazos, and James Caan. Directed by: Wes Anderson.

    Wes Anderson and the Wilson triplets have made a classic idiot comedy! DIGNAN LIVES! What a riot! I just could not stop laughing through this thing! I think my favorite moment is when they are all in the middle of the cold storage facility heist when Kumar, the supposed safe-cracker, suddenly looks at Applejack and says to Dignan, "Who dat man?" We know we are in BIG trouble now, don't we? But this whole thing is a continuous mental institution on wheels from start to finish! The little love story between Anthony and Inez is very touching, and provides us some relief from the non-stop insanity (or does it?). Anthony's loyal friendship with Dignan is also heartwarming, if you can stop laughing long enough to feel it! I just never get tired of watching films about idiots doing outrageously stupid things! Howsabout you? Are you in?

    Wes Anderson tends to be hit or miss for me. I love Moonrise Kingdom and Fantastic Mr. Fox, they both had a unique style, great performances, and well-written stories. Other times, I won't like his films such as The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou where the humor didn't work for me and most of the film lacked much of an actual plot. Nearly the same goes for Bottle Rocket, his first film.
