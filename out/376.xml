    I remember that we had this movie on VHS and that I really liked watching it when I was younger. I remember it being very entertaining at the time. Sinbad stars as a con artist who is trying to hide from some mobsters. In an airport he gets mistakenly befriended by a geek lawyer who thinks he's a long lost childhood friend. He becomes a house guest and makes himself comfortable in the lawyer's home and really gets to know his family and neighbors. This movie is very funny and well suited to watch with your family, I know I loved to watch it back then.

    Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is a big man with big dreams but try telling that to his car that backfires so often that he probably doesn't go through the drive thru at McDonald's (his favorite place to eat). Growing up as an orphan money centric Kevin has tried to get it any way he can, by selling baseball cards, watching tapes on home based businesses and finally borrowing 5k from Happy, the local loan shark. When it comes time to collect none of these business opportunities have paid off in the least so he has two options. The two mobsters kill him or he can have another day of life and an opportunity to pay 50k he naturally takes the latter and decides to skip town which is when he runs into Gary Young (Phil Hartmann) who is looking for his uptight conservative Derek Bond (Ron Glass who's well known for his role in Barney Miller) and he pretends to be the real Derek Bond with hilarious results especially when trying to "remember" the childhood he had with Gary at Camp Maple Ridge and the lyrics to Goodnight Irene First: A presentation in which he BS's his way through with hilarity, trying to figure out the details of Derek Bond before a garden party that he livens up after a mishap with an ice cream machine and a wine tasting that would otherwise be uptight and conservative. As he bumbles through the time at the Youngs he realizes that their family though a shining example of the nuclear family with a successful Mom (owner of a yogurt franchise) and Dad (who works for a rival frozen desert company in town) but the kids are not exactly the Leave It To Beaver kids. The oldest girl has a thing for dead guys and depressing poetry wearing black all the time and has a boyfriend named Steve but he prefers ST3 he is simply the son of a Congressman who thinks he's a white boy who grew up in the hood around black people (those who have are often called white chocolate). The daughter is just--trying to find her voice as well but not in the best of ways, Kevin teaches her to embrace life and living things and to not let a guy like ST3 take advantage of her and Kevin teaches ST3 a lesson: Don't leave a chicken dinner for a chicken McNugget (this other girl he was with at a shop Kevin went to) by getting pretty creative. His Son Jason is obsessed with pleasing his dad who wants him to become an all star basketball player, Kevin teaches him confidence by teaming up with him to be victorious over a bunch of teenagers who hog the basketball court and wins their clothes. The youngest girl is ignored so he basically watches cartoons with her throughout his time at the Young Family Gary, the Father is pitted against his wife by being given a Beaver Meadows account that is going into a frozen yogurt business and he has a conflict of interest. When mentioning this to his boss, Mr Pike, Pike simply says that he knows that Gary is best for this eventually Kevin steps in saying that he needs to stand up to his boss and can it which he does, Gary then resolves to work as in home counsel for his wife. As all this is going on, the thugs are homing in on Kevin until their search leads them to the Young Residence with the real Derek Bond who then states that he is the real Derek Bond and that this man is an impostor. Then things make sense for Gary and the family after Kevin is taken away and the family then decides to go after him when the real Derek Bond berates Kevin as a two bit crook. Final chase happens between Kevin and the mobsters and they acquire a scratch off which can be worth a cool million, they then part ways with Kevin and let him go. One year later, Kevin is rich with that Porsche thanks to a Handbook for House-guests he published. Now that the Youngs know who he is and that he was being himself, they forge a continuing friendship with Kevin and his friend Larry, and the movie closes with food themed Christmas Classics showcasing the voice talents of Phil Hartmann and Sinbad This movie is wonderful for both their comic stylings. Phil Hartmann is a great reactor and his delivery is amazing. The garden party scene really does fit in with his style as well,it's a good movie that really makes him shine while also making his co stars shine too. It's more of a farce comedy that I give 6 out of 10 stars, a nice family comedy and all around fun. It has its shortcomings but I really don't see them when I look at its message, I'd say it's more like a tale of friendship and it's power to change people for the better. And that is my review

    Many comedies are great comedies. Many of them are funny, entertaining, and clever. But House Guest, ( Sinbad and Phil Hartman ) is one of those I'm gonna need to pretend like I know what i'm doin', even though I don't know what I'm doin' comedies. It's one of those I have to act like I'm someone else kinda comedies. Every laugh's a screamer, every joke, clever, and every Sinbad goes, there's TROUBLE!!!! It's one of those movies you have to see again, and again, and again, mainly because it was just too damn funny. While watching the movie, I would say to myself, "It would be hilarious if that really happened, or if someone really said that, or I could just imagine me trying' to do something like that. The movie's great. I hope I gave you a good enough of an idea to help you understand how funny this movie is, without spoiling it for you.... The only reason why I rated this Movie "6/10" is because IMDb has it voted as that....

    I saw this movie at home. I love that movie. Sinbad was Hilarius. Sarah Young was cute. The Youngs dog is very interesting. My Favorite part when Sindbad was driving very funny. The Young's teenager is very cool. Sinbad and The Young's boy playing basket ball was very cool. Whats funny when Sinbad dunks the basketball in the hoop. In this movie Houseguest Sinbad was very smart and funny. Whats also funny when he talks about something in his car. My friend at Boca Sarah loves that movie. I hate when those bad guys tell Sinbad to do is give them the money. It's also funny when Sinbad throws the burger. Everybody will love this movie you will laugh at this movie it's hilarious

    Kevin (Sinbad) is a poor single man living in Pittsburgh, with his hamster, in a small apartment. An orphan, Kevin once bragged to his grade school classmates that, one day, he would be "very wealthy". Trouble is, none of his get-rich-quick schemes have panned out and Kevin is in debt to the local mobsters. When they come to collect, Keving speeds off to the airport to catch a flight. However, with the mob on his heels, Kevin overhears an even better opportunity for him to lay low for awhile, at the airport terminal. It seems that Gary (Phil Hartman)and his children are waiting for an old camp friend that Gary has not seen for 20 years. Kevin seizes the moment and declares himself to be Dr. Derek Bond, a dentist, to Gary and the kids. Gary is delighted to see him and takes him home. Once there, in heavenly suburbia, Kevin finds out he is supposed to make a speech at the local elementary school, on career day. Okay. Kevin also learns he is reputed to be a strict vegetarian. Horrors. But, as the family showers him with gifts and parties, Kevin wonders, as do we all, how soon will they learn the truth about his identity? This is a great film, very funny and very spirit-lifting. Sinbad's Kevin is a such a lovable character, despite his scheming, that everyone is hoping for a happy ending. Hartman, likewise, is dead-pan funny in his role as a much put-upon lawyer with a family that looks perfect but which, in reality, has some problems to overcome. The setting is lovely, the costumes are nice, and the look of the film is quite wonderful, too. Do you want to cheer up yourself and your family in a big fashion? This is the film for you, as to watch it is to love it and laugh it up till the clouds overhead are long gone.

    When I saw previews for this, I really wanted to see it. Unfortunately I never got time to go the movie theater to go see it. But when it became a new rental, I went right down to Blockbuster and rented it. And I loved this movie. The pairing of Sinbad and Phil Hartman was excellent. The part when they leave the airport is hilarious and also when Sinbad tells Jason "Caress the wheel like a woman. Don't hold it like a pervert!" Then Jason says "But I don't know how to caress a woman." LOL. That part was hilarious. From beginning to end, this movie is definitely an all-time classic. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Now a days it's over-hyped garbage like The Da Vinci Code or these teen slasher psycho movies where everyone just runs around and screams. Another part I really liked was when Sinbad says to the wine critic "Sounds like someone needs a woman." That part was hilarious too. Houseguest is a comedic gem that very few comedies can live up to. Definitely worth seeing for anyone who hasn't seen it yet and definitely worth buying to add to your collection!

    Since today is Sinbad's 50th birthday, I wanted to talk about one of his movies. "Houseguest" is probably the sort of movie that can only appeal to eleven-year-old boys, but it has its moments. Portraying a debt-ridden man (Sinbad) posing as the friend of a suburban man (Phil Hartman) and moving into his house to avoid some gangsters, it's pretty silly, but not harming anything. A particularly goofy scene is the whole "washing balls" sketch. So, it's the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Don't expect a religious experience, just expect to laugh (I'm sure that you will). Among other things, it goes to show what we lost when Phil Hartman was murdered. Also starring Kim Greist and Jeffrey Jones.

    HOUSESITTER, in my opinion, is a good film that's very funny, albeit somewhat crude. It's a story about what can happen when you don't pay off your debts. If you ask me, the way that Kevin (Sinbad) talked his way into staying with the Youngs (Phil Hartman, Kim Griest, Chauncey Leopardi, Talia Seider, Kim Murphy) was pretty darn clever. However, when Kevin performed that oral surgery, I think I wanted to puke. This was because he wasn't a certified dentist. In conclusion, if you like Sinbad or Phil Hartman movies, this is definitely one to see. You will truly enjoy it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and enjoy it.

    By no means a great comedy, "Houseguest" actually comes across as being fairly entertaining thanks largely to the presence of the late, great Phil Hartman. Hartman's deadpan, ironic delivery always cracked me up on "SNL," and although his film career never really took off prior to his death, he had some good supporting roles, and this is one of them. Sinbad is basically as annoying as ever (although, admittedly, not nearly as bad as some other comedians-turned-family-entertainers) and the plot is very basic and recycled - a guy on the run from some Mafioso types decides to take on the identity of someone else through a series of bizarre misunderstandings. In this case Sinbad finds himself pretending to be the old friend of Hartman's, who is now a brain doctor. There are actually some rather amusing scenes involving the forced and awkward such as when Sinbad is forced to give a speech on brain surgery despite knowing absolutely nothing about the topic. Overall, not by any means a great comedy, but something that can easily divert your attention on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

    HOUSESITTER, in my opinion, is a good film that's very funny, albeit somewhat crude. It's a story about what can happen when you don't pay off your debts. If you ask me, the way that Kevin (Sinbad) talked his way into staying with the Youngs (Phil Hartman, Kim Griest, Chauncey Leopardi, Talia Seider, Kim Murphy) was pretty darn clever. However, when Kevin performed that oral surgery, I think I wanted to puke. This was because he wasn't a certified dentist. In conclusion, if you like Sinbad or Phil Hartman movies, this is definitely one to see. You will truly enjoy it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and enjoy it.

    By no means a great comedy, "Houseguest" actually comes across as being fairly entertaining thanks largely to the presence of the late, great Phil Hartman. Hartman's deadpan, ironic delivery always cracked me up on "SNL," and although his film career never really took off prior to his death, he had some good supporting roles, and this is one of them. Sinbad is basically as annoying as ever (although, admittedly, not nearly as bad as some other comedians-turned-family-entertainers) and the plot is very basic and recycled - a guy on the run from some Mafioso types decides to take on the identity of someone else through a series of bizarre misunderstandings. In this case Sinbad finds himself pretending to be the old friend of Hartman's, who is now a brain doctor. There are actually some rather amusing scenes involving the forced and awkward such as when Sinbad is forced to give a speech on brain surgery despite knowing absolutely nothing about the topic. Overall, not by any means a great comedy, but something that can easily divert your attention on a rainy Sunday afternoon.

    I remember that we had this movie on VHS and that I really liked watching it when I was younger. I remember it being very entertaining at the time. Sinbad stars as a con artist who is trying to hide from some mobsters. In an airport he gets mistakenly befriended by a geek lawyer who thinks he's a long lost childhood friend. He becomes a house guest and makes himself comfortable in the lawyer's home and really gets to know his family and neighbors. This movie is very funny and well suited to watch with your family, I know I loved to watch it back then.

    Kevin Franklin (Sinbad) is a big man with big dreams but try telling that to his car that backfires so often that he probably doesn't go through the drive thru at McDonald's (his favorite place to eat). Growing up as an orphan money centric Kevin has tried to get it any way he can, by selling baseball cards, watching tapes on home based businesses and finally borrowing 5k from Happy, the local loan shark. When it comes time to collect none of these business opportunities have paid off in the least so he has two options. The two mobsters kill him or he can have another day of life and an opportunity to pay 50k he naturally takes the latter and decides to skip town which is when he runs into Gary Young (Phil Hartmann) who is looking for his uptight conservative Derek Bond (Ron Glass who's well known for his role in Barney Miller) and he pretends to be the real Derek Bond with hilarious results especially when trying to "remember" the childhood he had with Gary at Camp Maple Ridge and the lyrics to Goodnight Irene First: A presentation in which he BS's his way through with hilarity, trying to figure out the details of Derek Bond before a garden party that he livens up after a mishap with an ice cream machine and a wine tasting that would otherwise be uptight and conservative. As he bumbles through the time at the Youngs he realizes that their family though a shining example of the nuclear family with a successful Mom (owner of a yogurt franchise) and Dad (who works for a rival frozen desert company in town) but the kids are not exactly the Leave It To Beaver kids. The oldest girl has a thing for dead guys and depressing poetry wearing black all the time and has a boyfriend named Steve but he prefers ST3 he is simply the son of a Congressman who thinks he's a white boy who grew up in the hood around black people (those who have are often called white chocolate). The daughter is just--trying to find her voice as well but not in the best of ways, Kevin teaches her to embrace life and living things and to not let a guy like ST3 take advantage of her and Kevin teaches ST3 a lesson: Don't leave a chicken dinner for a chicken McNugget (this other girl he was with at a shop Kevin went to) by getting pretty creative. His Son Jason is obsessed with pleasing his dad who wants him to become an all star basketball player, Kevin teaches him confidence by teaming up with him to be victorious over a bunch of teenagers who hog the basketball court and wins their clothes. The youngest girl is ignored so he basically watches cartoons with her throughout his time at the Young Family Gary, the Father is pitted against his wife by being given a Beaver Meadows account that is going into a frozen yogurt business and he has a conflict of interest. When mentioning this to his boss, Mr Pike, Pike simply says that he knows that Gary is best for this eventually Kevin steps in saying that he needs to stand up to his boss and can it which he does, Gary then resolves to work as in home counsel for his wife. As all this is going on, the thugs are homing in on Kevin until their search leads them to the Young Residence with the real Derek Bond who then states that he is the real Derek Bond and that this man is an impostor. Then things make sense for Gary and the family after Kevin is taken away and the family then decides to go after him when the real Derek Bond berates Kevin as a two bit crook. Final chase happens between Kevin and the mobsters and they acquire a scratch off which can be worth a cool million, they then part ways with Kevin and let him go. One year later, Kevin is rich with that Porsche thanks to a Handbook for House-guests he published. Now that the Youngs know who he is and that he was being himself, they forge a continuing friendship with Kevin and his friend Larry, and the movie closes with food themed Christmas Classics showcasing the voice talents of Phil Hartmann and Sinbad This movie is wonderful for both their comic stylings. Phil Hartmann is a great reactor and his delivery is amazing. The garden party scene really does fit in with his style as well,it's a good movie that really makes him shine while also making his co stars shine too. It's more of a farce comedy that I give 6 out of 10 stars, a nice family comedy and all around fun. It has its shortcomings but I really don't see them when I look at its message, I'd say it's more like a tale of friendship and it's power to change people for the better. And that is my review

    Many comedies are great comedies. Many of them are funny, entertaining, and clever. But House Guest, ( Sinbad and Phil Hartman ) is one of those I'm gonna need to pretend like I know what i'm doin', even though I don't know what I'm doin' comedies. It's one of those I have to act like I'm someone else kinda comedies. Every laugh's a screamer, every joke, clever, and every Sinbad goes, there's TROUBLE!!!! It's one of those movies you have to see again, and again, and again, mainly because it was just too damn funny. While watching the movie, I would say to myself, "It would be hilarious if that really happened, or if someone really said that, or I could just imagine me trying' to do something like that. The movie's great. I hope I gave you a good enough of an idea to help you understand how funny this movie is, without spoiling it for you.... The only reason why I rated this Movie "6/10" is because IMDb has it voted as that....

    I saw this movie at home. I love that movie. Sinbad was Hilarius. Sarah Young was cute. The Youngs dog is very interesting. My Favorite part when Sindbad was driving very funny. The Young's teenager is very cool. Sinbad and The Young's boy playing basket ball was very cool. Whats funny when Sinbad dunks the basketball in the hoop. In this movie Houseguest Sinbad was very smart and funny. Whats also funny when he talks about something in his car. My friend at Boca Sarah loves that movie. I hate when those bad guys tell Sinbad to do is give them the money. It's also funny when Sinbad throws the burger. Everybody will love this movie you will laugh at this movie it's hilarious

    Kevin (Sinbad) is a poor single man living in Pittsburgh, with his hamster, in a small apartment. An orphan, Kevin once bragged to his grade school classmates that, one day, he would be "very wealthy". Trouble is, none of his get-rich-quick schemes have panned out and Kevin is in debt to the local mobsters. When they come to collect, Keving speeds off to the airport to catch a flight. However, with the mob on his heels, Kevin overhears an even better opportunity for him to lay low for awhile, at the airport terminal. It seems that Gary (Phil Hartman)and his children are waiting for an old camp friend that Gary has not seen for 20 years. Kevin seizes the moment and declares himself to be Dr. Derek Bond, a dentist, to Gary and the kids. Gary is delighted to see him and takes him home. Once there, in heavenly suburbia, Kevin finds out he is supposed to make a speech at the local elementary school, on career day. Okay. Kevin also learns he is reputed to be a strict vegetarian. Horrors. But, as the family showers him with gifts and parties, Kevin wonders, as do we all, how soon will they learn the truth about his identity? This is a great film, very funny and very spirit-lifting. Sinbad's Kevin is a such a lovable character, despite his scheming, that everyone is hoping for a happy ending. Hartman, likewise, is dead-pan funny in his role as a much put-upon lawyer with a family that looks perfect but which, in reality, has some problems to overcome. The setting is lovely, the costumes are nice, and the look of the film is quite wonderful, too. Do you want to cheer up yourself and your family in a big fashion? This is the film for you, as to watch it is to love it and laugh it up till the clouds overhead are long gone.

    When I saw previews for this, I really wanted to see it. Unfortunately I never got time to go the movie theater to go see it. But when it became a new rental, I went right down to Blockbuster and rented it. And I loved this movie. The pairing of Sinbad and Phil Hartman was excellent. The part when they leave the airport is hilarious and also when Sinbad tells Jason "Caress the wheel like a woman. Don't hold it like a pervert!" Then Jason says "But I don't know how to caress a woman." LOL. That part was hilarious. From beginning to end, this movie is definitely an all-time classic. Too bad they don't make movies like this anymore. Now a days it's over-hyped garbage like The Da Vinci Code or these teen slasher psycho movies where everyone just runs around and screams. Another part I really liked was when Sinbad says to the wine critic "Sounds like someone needs a woman." That part was hilarious too. Houseguest is a comedic gem that very few comedies can live up to. Definitely worth seeing for anyone who hasn't seen it yet and definitely worth buying to add to your collection!

    Since today is Sinbad's 50th birthday, I wanted to talk about one of his movies. "Houseguest" is probably the sort of movie that can only appeal to eleven-year-old boys, but it has its moments. Portraying a debt-ridden man (Sinbad) posing as the friend of a suburban man (Phil Hartman) and moving into his house to avoid some gangsters, it's pretty silly, but not harming anything. A particularly goofy scene is the whole "washing balls" sketch. So, it's the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Don't expect a religious experience, just expect to laugh (I'm sure that you will). Among other things, it goes to show what we lost when Phil Hartman was murdered. Also starring Kim Greist and Jeffrey Jones.

A particularly goofy scene is the whole "washing balls" sketch. So, it's the sort of movie that you watch with best buds. Don't expect a religious experience, just expect to laugh (I'm sure that you will). Among other things, it goes to show what we lost when Phil Hartman was murdered. Also starring Kim Greist and Jeffrey Jones.

    HOUSESITTER, in my opinion, is a good film that's very funny, albeit somewhat crude. It's a story about what can happen when you don't pay off your debts. If you ask me, the way that Kevin (Sinbad) talked his way into staying with the Youngs (Phil Hartman, Kim Griest, Chauncey Leopardi, Talia Seider, Kim Murphy) was pretty darn clever. However, when Kevin performed that oral surgery, I think I wanted to puke. This was because he wasn't a certified dentist. In conclusion, if you like Sinbad or Phil Hartman movies, this is definitely one to see. You will truly enjoy it, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and enjoy it.

    By no means a great comedy, "Houseguest" actually comes across as being fairly entertaining thanks largely to the presence of the late, great Phil Hartman. Hartman's deadpan, ironic delivery always cracked me up on "SNL," and although his film career never really took off prior to his death, he had some good supporting roles, and this is one of them. Sinbad is basically as annoying as ever (although, admittedly, not nearly as bad as some other comedians-turned-family-entertainers) and the plot is very basic and recycled - a guy on the run from some Mafioso types decides to take on the identity of someone else through a series of bizarre misunderstandings. In this case Sinbad finds himself pretending to be the old friend of Hartman's, who is now a brain doctor. There are actually some rather amusing scenes involving the forced and awkward such as when Sinbad is forced to give a speech on brain surgery despite knowing absolutely nothing about the topic. Overall, not by any means a great comedy, but something that can easily divert your attention on a rainy Sunday afternoon.
