 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Amanda Lemmon is a street-wise orphan who's about to be adopted by a family who uses children for their own selfish gain. Her case worker, Diane, loves her and would like to adopt her, however, since she's single and doesn't have money, she is unable to do so. Alyssa Callaway is a rich girl home from boarding school for the summer and she and her dad, Roger, go to their summer home. There, he tells her that he is marrying Clarice, a child hating gold digger. During an attempt to run away, Alyssa stumbles upon a summer camp where she runs into Amanda, who looks EXACTLY like her. The two then switch places to get rid of Clarice and unite Roger and Diane.

    Very enjoyable film! I watched it back in 1996 and I loved this film. The Olsen twins made great job the same like Kirsty Alley and Guttenberg. After this movie I became a fan of Kirtsy Alley and Olsen twins. One of their best movies. Since then I got it on the tape. I still watch it sometimes and it brings me back to the childhood when I was a kid of 10 years old. It is a simple film about twins that meet and want to change the worlds. Lots of laugh, funny situations and quotes. A summer vacation begin. Nice shots, very good script. A movie to learn from. This film is very suitable for kids. Good actors, cast, screenplay and action! A movie for whole family!

    How I loathe these romantic comedies... The only one who could have made this movie any worse is Owen Wilson, the king of senseless romantic comedies. The comedy is not very intelligent. There are loads of falling jokes who are supposed to be funny. The jokes are bad, and the story shines with its inconsistency. Be honest people. Do these films ever work? I don't even like the concept. I have yet to see a genuinely intelligent and funny romantic. comedy. Is it just me or ought America to be ashamed?

    Thea acting was probably 3.6 for Mary kate and ashley's performances, not the best out of this movie, but cute. and the movie was a naughty child thing but the movie was OK so it's because the acting was not terrible and not the best movie and acting of all, but it was good. So this movie is not bad connected to not horrible and not great but still I'll give it a 6.5 for some funny scenes and the acting scenes were pretty good so I'll be nice to the movie since it's old but I think a maybe 5 or 6 year old will like this movie and even some of the campers. This is a total rip copy off of the Parent traps movies and so I liked the Parent trap and this movie is still quite remarkable for 1995 but not the best year to release movies out,I thought the 2001 and the 2002's movies were quite remarkable and unforgettable like I am Sam or any other movie released out then in the 1990s but I guess 8 miles was a good movie too but beware that movie is rated R but for opinion I'll give this movie "A great of a comedy film" I say.

    The Olsen Twins take "The Parent Trap" to a new level as they agree to switch places to see how the other half lives. As the stars, they set the tone for the movie and keep it light-hearted throughout the film, with good and evil on both sides of the tracks waiting for them. Guttenberg and Alley turn in excellent performances, as well. This movie is better than the original movie with Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, in that they get actual twins to play the girls (although the Disney studios did a great job with Hayley Mills in the starring role). The big difference is that the Olsen twins don't play sisters, but are actual strangers who decide to hook the two adult stars up, one the father, who's a company mogul who made it big in the cell phone industry, and the other, a case worker for Social Services in an orphanage that spends a week at a summer camp built by deceased woman who was married to the cell phone mogul. When you throw in a gold-digging d&eacute;butante about to catch her man, comedy ensues that even the most heavy-hearted adult can't help but enjoy. It wouldn't be fair to compare this to 1961 without going the other way and comparing it to the film of the same name released three years later than this particular film in 1998. To be honest, I can't see myself comparing it to Lindsay Lohan, because there's a big difference between her and the Olsen Twins in more than just numbers. Well, maybe numbers DO make the difference, because I give this film 8 out of 10, but Lohan only gets 5 out of 10 (and I even like Dennis Quaid, as an actor). And I can't say anything nice about Lohan because I think she's... Well, my mother always told me, "If you can't say anything nice about someone, keep your trap shut!"

    For all of us dads who got THAT look from their wives indicating that they WILL sit down and watch It Takes Two with their daughters, there's comfort in knowing that, if one is really sneaky, one can hide a book in the living room and relieve some of the boredom. Which is the primary emotion I felt watching this tweener garbage. There's one, exactly one funny line in It Takes Two, a lame, sort-of copy of The Parent Trap, with the Olsen Twins, Steve Guttenberg, and Kirstie Alley. Alley is trying to pull herself together to impress Guttenberg on a date (or something) and, in order to get a PG instead of the dreaded G, she grabs her breasts, pushes them up and pep talks something like, "Okay, girls. Are you ready?" That is the sum total of the wit and wisdom of this brainless kiddie flick. I'd like to say that I was able to get in some good reading while sitting with my daughter some years ago, but I'd be lying. The wife sat with us and kept me from getting to the book I had stashed under the sofa cushion.

    This film is by far the best work of the Olsen Twins. If you think that all Mary-Kate and Ashley movies are girly and lack substance, this movie defies that stereotype. IF YOU ONLY WATCH ONE MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY MOVIE, THIS IS THE ONE TO SEE! Not to mention, of course, this movie has Kirstie Alley in it. What more could you ask? Well, there's more; Do you remember the actress who played Ross Geller's ex-wife, Carol, on "Friends"? Jane Sibbett plays the despicable gold digger Clarise Kensington who's only wish is to get the wealthy Roger Callaway (Steve Guttenburg) and his immense fortune all to herself. The twins play the lovable Amanda and Alyssa - identical strangers. "It Takes Two" is the best movie about twins along with Lindsay Lohan's "The Parent Trap". Definitely the family movie (not the same as a children's movie) of the year. If anything, it won a Kid's Choice Award.

    IT TAKES TWO (1995) ***1/2 One of the first Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen vehicles, it's a nice little family film which the young and young at heart will enjoy. The story, which seems to resemble that of 'The Parent Trap', has the Olsen twins play opposites in social standings - Mary-Kate, an orphan who lives in a foster system; Ashley, the daughter of a well-to-do millionaire - who cross paths at a summer camp. In hopes of getting a taste of a different lifestyle, they trade lives for the weekend, and their caretakers don't deduce they're both taking care of different girls. The production's whole is not extremely intelligent by any means, but noteworthy Steve Guttenburg and Kirstie Alley are very watchable in their roles.

    This is one of my favorite Olsen Twins movie of all times. It starts out when a street tough orphan(Mary Kate Olsen) and her case worker like a big sister(Kristy Alley) go to summer camp, then she stumbles apon a look alike (Ashley Olsen) who is the daughter of one of the richest man in the world. The girls switch places to bring her dad and the case worker together. The only problem he is a engaged to be married to someone else. And that someone is not very nice. The movie seemed very interesting to me because it reminds of Parent Trap and Annie which I enjoyed while getting older. The movie seemed charming and fun.

    I thought the movie was cute, but parts of it suck - like the parts that can't possibly be real. I mean, identical strangers? Please!!! And how are two people from completely different walks of life get into each other's parts like they'd been born to it, even if they shared the same gene pool, which Amanda and Alyssa don't seem to? However, the billionaire scenes were quite a sight for sore eyes, and the scenes between Diane and Roger were really romantic. And the twins were really good. Maybe the last part was a little too crude - ripping off the back of the evil stepmother's dress, it kind of spoilt the funny, sweet, and well-done scenes for me. Still, unreal as it is, I guess movies are SUPPOSED to be unreal, that's part of the whole package, the enjoyment of the fantasy or whatever you call it, so in that score It Takes Two was pretty relishable and enjoyable. Mary-Kate and Ashley were, as usual, awesome in the movie. They managed to pull off the whole thing...they, with Roger Calloway and Diane Barrows (I haven't looked at the cast list for the real names yet!) made the movie a fun-filled, worth-watching, sweet little fantasy that most families would miss out if they didn't see. Very cute!

    The Olsen Twins take "The Parent Trap" to a new level as they agree to switch places to see how the other half lives. As the stars, they set the tone for the movie and keep it light-hearted throughout the film, with good and evil on both sides of the tracks waiting for them. Guttenberg and Alley turn in excellent performances, as well. This movie is better than the original movie with Brian Keith and Maureen O'Hara, in that they get actual twins to play the girls (although the Disney studios did a great job with Hayley Mills in the starring role). The big difference is that the Olsen twins don't play sisters, but are actual strangers who decide to hook the two adult stars up, one the father, who's a company mogul who made it big in the cell phone industry, and the other, a case worker for Social Services in an orphanage that spends a week at a summer camp built by deceased woman who was married to the cell phone mogul. When you throw in a gold-digging d&eacute;butante about to catch her man, comedy ensues that even the most heavy-hearted adult can't help but enjoy. It wouldn't be fair to compare this to 1961 without going the other way and comparing it to the film of the same name released three years later than this particular film in 1998. To be honest, I can't see myself comparing it to Lindsay Lohan, because there's a big difference between her and the Olsen Twins in more than just numbers. Well, maybe numbers DO make the difference, because I give this film 8 out of 10, but Lohan only gets 5 out of 10 (and I even like Dennis Quaid, as an actor). And I can't say anything nice about Lohan because I think she's... Well, my mother always told me, "If you can't say anything nice about someone, keep your trap shut!"

    For all of us dads who got THAT look from their wives indicating that they WILL sit down and watch It Takes Two with their daughters, there's comfort in knowing that, if one is really sneaky, one can hide a book in the living room and relieve some of the boredom. Which is the primary emotion I felt watching this tweener garbage. There's one, exactly one funny line in It Takes Two, a lame, sort-of copy of The Parent Trap, with the Olsen Twins, Steve Guttenberg, and Kirstie Alley. Alley is trying to pull herself together to impress Guttenberg on a date (or something) and, in order to get a PG instead of the dreaded G, she grabs her breasts, pushes them up and pep talks something like, "Okay, girls. Are you ready?" That is the sum total of the wit and wisdom of this brainless kiddie flick. I'd like to say that I was able to get in some good reading while sitting with my daughter some years ago, but I'd be lying. The wife sat with us and kept me from getting to the book I had stashed under the sofa cushion.

    This film is by far the best work of the Olsen Twins. If you think that all Mary-Kate and Ashley movies are girly and lack substance, this movie defies that stereotype. IF YOU ONLY WATCH ONE MARY-KATE AND ASHLEY MOVIE, THIS IS THE ONE TO SEE! Not to mention, of course, this movie has Kirstie Alley in it. What more could you ask? Well, there's more; Do you remember the actress who played Ross Geller's ex-wife, Carol, on "Friends"? Jane Sibbett plays the despicable gold digger Clarise Kensington who's only wish is to get the wealthy Roger Callaway (Steve Guttenburg) and his immense fortune all to herself. The twins play the lovable Amanda and Alyssa - identical strangers. "It Takes Two" is the best movie about twins along with Lindsay Lohan's "The Parent Trap". Definitely the family movie (not the same as a children's movie) of the year. If anything, it won a Kid's Choice Award.

    IT TAKES TWO (1995) ***1/2 One of the first Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen vehicles, it's a nice little family film which the young and young at heart will enjoy. The story, which seems to resemble that of 'The Parent Trap', has the Olsen twins play opposites in social standings - Mary-Kate, an orphan who lives in a foster system; Ashley, the daughter of a well-to-do millionaire - who cross paths at a summer camp. In hopes of getting a taste of a different lifestyle, they trade lives for the weekend, and their caretakers don't deduce they're both taking care of different girls. The production's whole is not extremely intelligent by any means, but noteworthy Steve Guttenburg and Kirstie Alley are very watchable in their roles.

    This is one of my favorite Olsen Twins movie of all times. It starts out when a street tough orphan(Mary Kate Olsen) and her case worker like a big sister(Kristy Alley) go to summer camp, then she stumbles apon a look alike (Ashley Olsen) who is the daughter of one of the richest man in the world. The girls switch places to bring her dad and the case worker together. The only problem he is a engaged to be married to someone else. And that someone is not very nice. The movie seemed very interesting to me because it reminds of Parent Trap and Annie which I enjoyed while getting older. The movie seemed charming and fun.

    I thought the movie was cute, but parts of it suck - like the parts that can't possibly be real. I mean, identical strangers? Please!!! And how are two people from completely different walks of life get into each other's parts like they'd been born to it, even if they shared the same gene pool, which Amanda and Alyssa don't seem to? However, the billionaire scenes were quite a sight for sore eyes, and the scenes between Diane and Roger were really romantic. And the twins were really good. Maybe the last part was a little too crude - ripping off the back of the evil stepmother's dress, it kind of spoilt the funny, sweet, and well-done scenes for me. Still, unreal as it is, I guess movies are SUPPOSED to be unreal, that's part of the whole package, the enjoyment of the fantasy or whatever you call it, so in that score It Takes Two was pretty relishable and enjoyable. Mary-Kate and Ashley were, as usual, awesome in the movie. They managed to pull off the whole thing...they, with Roger Calloway and Diane Barrows (I haven't looked at the cast list for the real names yet!) made the movie a fun-filled, worth-watching, sweet little fantasy that most families would miss out if they didn't see. Very cute!

    Very enjoyable film! I watched it back in 1996 and I loved this film. The Olsen twins made great job the same like Kirsty Alley and Guttenberg. After this movie I became a fan of Kirtsy Alley and Olsen twins. One of their best movies. Since then I got it on the tape. I still watch it sometimes and it brings me back to the childhood when I was a kid of 10 years old. It is a simple film about twins that meet and want to change the worlds. Lots of laugh, funny situations and quotes. A summer vacation begin. Nice shots, very good script. A movie to learn from. This film is very suitable for kids. Good actors, cast, screenplay and action! A movie for whole family!

    How I loathe these romantic comedies... The only one who could have made this movie any worse is Owen Wilson, the king of senseless romantic comedies. The comedy is not very intelligent. There are loads of falling jokes who are supposed to be funny. The jokes are bad, and the story shines with its inconsistency. Be honest people. Do these films ever work? I don't even like the concept. I have yet to see a genuinely intelligent and funny romantic. comedy. Is it just me or ought America to be ashamed?

    Thea acting was probably 3.6 for Mary kate and ashley's performances, not the best out of this movie, but cute. and the movie was a naughty child thing but the movie was OK so it's because the acting was not terrible and not the best movie and acting of all, but it was good. So this movie is not bad connected to not horrible and not great but still I'll give it a 6.5 for some funny scenes and the acting scenes were pretty good so I'll be nice to the movie since it's old but I think a maybe 5 or 6 year old will like this movie and even some of the campers. This is a total rip copy off of the Parent traps movies and so I liked the Parent trap and this movie is still quite remarkable for 1995 but not the best year to release movies out,I thought the 2001 and the 2002's movies were quite remarkable and unforgettable like I am Sam or any other movie released out then in the 1990s but I guess 8 miles was a good movie too but beware that movie is rated R but for opinion I'll give this movie "A great of a comedy film" I say.

In hopes of getting a taste of a different lifestyle, they trade lives for the weekend, and their caretakers don't deduce they're both taking care of different girls. The production's whole is not extremely intelligent by any means, but noteworthy Steve Guttenburg and Kirstie Alley are very watchable in their roles.

    This is one of my favorite Olsen Twins movie of all times. It starts out when a street tough orphan(Mary Kate Olsen) and her case worker like a big sister(Kristy Alley) go to summer camp, then she stumbles apon a look alike (Ashley Olsen) who is the daughter of one of the richest man in the world. The girls switch places to bring her dad and the case worker together. The only problem he is a engaged to be married to someone else. And that someone is not very nice. The movie seemed very interesting to me because it reminds of Parent Trap and Annie which I enjoyed while getting older. The movie seemed charming and fun.

    I thought the movie was cute, but parts of it suck - like the parts that can't possibly be real. I mean, identical strangers? Please!!! And how are two people from completely different walks of life get into each other's parts like they'd been born to it, even if they shared the same gene pool, which Amanda and Alyssa don't seem to? However, the billionaire scenes were quite a sight for sore eyes, and the scenes between Diane and Roger were really romantic. And the twins were really good. Maybe the last part was a little too crude - ripping off the back of the evil stepmother's dress, it kind of spoilt the funny, sweet, and well-done scenes for me. Still, unreal as it is, I guess movies are SUPPOSED to be unreal, that's part of the whole package, the enjoyment of the fantasy or whatever you call it, so in that score It Takes Two was pretty relishable and enjoyable. Mary-Kate and Ashley were, as usual, awesome in the movie. They managed to pull off the whole thing...they, with Roger Calloway and Diane Barrows (I haven't looked at the cast list for the real names yet!) made the movie a fun-filled, worth-watching, sweet little fantasy that most families would miss out if they didn't see. Very cute!
