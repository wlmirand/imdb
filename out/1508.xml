    Harry & Dolly, a married couple with their three children have a nanny Jennifer. One evening when the two go to a party, she comes at their home for what will be again a ordinary day of work. Her boyfriend, Jack meets Mark, a lover that Jennifer had a relationship before. They have fun that night until he tells to give his girlfriend's a call to ask her if he can go at her workplace. How things are not going well between them, she refused saying it needs more time to figure out their relationship and where it goes, anyway she can't let him come because she must take care of children. Mark not satisfied with this answer and convinces him to go there and let him still inside. But this time Jack it's not lucky, it is rejected and Mark offered him to spy her so they can see what she does until he comes to the idea wondered if she forget the door open when it was closed in the nose. The strange thing is that in reality the door is open so that the two can easily enter the house. Meanwhile, the owners are busy getting drunk at the party and Harry thinks at the nanny has his fantasies with her and looking for any excuse to go home. Find one saying that his head hurts because of so much alcohol and have to return home in order to take a pill. Meanwhile between good guy and bad guy altercation occurs which Mark wins for a moment. Drunk husband manages to reach home with the car, hit Mark, the police arrives, nanny got into the car and the question is what were you thinking? That is, what we thought when we decided to watch this movie? Of course the best are those few smiles in this movie during the dreams. But even so to see one at every 10 minutes is not quite right. Can not say anything about this film than continue to dream and change it.

    I rented this direct-to-video movie because there's Alicia Silverstone in it, and honestly I really don't understand at all the choice of making bizarre things such as this or her movie "True Crime" for example... Who would want to see that anyway, these are the kind of things I wouldn't be surprised to see if coming from writer/director Roger Vadim and actress Brigitte Bardot during the 60s before he made quality things, but not from the actress who made "Clueless" in the 90s... The tone of this one is really more inspired than Roger Vadim's movies of the 60s, it's an imitation who's more artistic and less serious, but still... In any case anybody who like rough sex or seeing a babysitter named Jennifer (played by Alicia Silverstone) in a bath full of white bubbles should watch this, otherwise it should be skipped at all cost; there's no story and no acting at all except for Alicia Silverstone...

    "The Babysitter" is about as imaginative as its title (both appear to have been recycled). It's just one of a handful of low-profile movies Alicia Silverstone made before her career took off. Here, she's a solemn, sexy-in-spite-of-herself teen trying to earn some bucks by babysitting, seemingly unaware that she has male teenagers drooling and male adults fawning. Uneven drama with ham-handed flickers of surrealism. Executive produced (for some unknown reason) by Joel Schumacher, who later directed Silverstone in 1997's "Batman and Robin". This one is strictly amateur night, despite a good supporting cast including George Segal and Lois Chiles. NO STARS from ****

    This is a truly bizarre but awesome thriller, that's quite fascinating to watch, with a unique story and fantastic performances!. All the characters are great, and it has some bizarre imaginary scenes as well, plus Alicia Silverstone is simply amazing in this!. The finale is very suspenseful and shocking, and all the characters fantasies were really quite twisted and sickening but still fascinating all the same, plus for a direct to video film this is top notch!. Nicky Katt is excellent as the asshole trouble maker as he sickened me with his actions, and some scenes really disturbed me (like the kid walking in the bathroom door to see Alicia naked in the tub, and she let him do it), and this is pretty well made and written as well, plus this should be much higher then 4.0 in my opinion. Jeremy London is also great as the lead, and I am glad I taped this on the scream channel as well, plus it Doesen't have your usual forgiveness type ending. This film will not be for everyone, and I liked the atmosphere it had in it too, plus J.T Walsh was also awesome in this. This is a truly bizarre but awesome thriller, that's quite fascinating to watch, with a unique story and fantastic performances, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. Guy Ferland does an awesome! job here with excellent camera work, adding some good atmosphere, and keeping the film at an engrossing pace. The Acting is excellent. Alicia Silverstone is amazing as always and is amazing here,she is incredibly gorgeous, vulnerable, extremely sexy, seductive, and also very mysterious, her character was a really good one as this is one of the most interesting roles she has played! (Silverstone Rules!!!!!!!). Jeremy London is awesome as the guy who is attracted to Alicia he was very likable, even if he did go to far at times. Nicky Katt is awesome as the asshole, he really sickened me with his actions, as I was glad he got what was coming to him at the end. J.T. Walsh is really good here, he had a bizarre but great role, his fantasies were very disturbing. Lee Garlington is decent as the wife. George Segal is rather wasted as a parent. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5

    saw this movie when i was in grade school on the action channel. sliverstone did show her breasts in this movie, the reason it was cut is because there is nothing there to write home about. otherwise the movie was interesting, had a kick ass soundtrack. 'the lie still in the garden' song rocked. jeremy London and the other dude were hott. i just felt bad that the father was arrested at the end. i felt that mark had it coming. the only twisted part was when the little boy was asked by alica to wash her back. but a fanasty, not reality. her character was stupid and so was jeremy's. it was weird seeing the guy that played mark as a tough guy.

    I first saw The Babysitter when it was released all the way back in 1995, and it still holds up well today. This sleeper stars Alicia Silverstone as the babysitter, who is the obsession of many males in the film. Mr. Tucker (played by J.T. Walsh), the father of the children she babysits, lusts after her, as does her boyfriend, Jack (played by Jeremy London), and a neighborhood rebel, Mark (played by Nicky Katt). Based on a short story by Robert Coover, The Babysitter goes like this: After refusing a date with Mark, the babysitter goes to the Tucker residence on a Friday night to babysit the three children there. Jack is reading Catcher in the Rye in a diner when Mark comes along and begins to coax him into hanging out with him, which leads to the two of them spying on the babysitter while she is looking after the children. The Tuckers are at a party but Mr. Tucker finds any excuse to go home, much to the dismay of his wife, Dolly (good performance given by Lee Garlington) who herself fantasizes about Bill (played by George Segal), the party host. Many of the characters consume alcohol, and the combination of booze and their own obsessions leads to a deadly climax. The Babysitter contains many dream sequences which may be difficult to discern from the actual happenings if you are viewing for the first time. All of the players in this movie do a great job. It is very different and I recommend it.

    At least in my opinion it does. Made before she hit big time with CLUELESS, this film was released to capitalize on her "then" success. She plays a pretty babysitter who is the object of pretty much every male character in this movie When her boyfriend shows up & his friend at the house she's at we are then set for what appears to be an endless succession of sexy fantasies that all evolve around her, all of which stems from the imagination of the Father of the kids she is babysitting, the Boyfriend, his Friend, & the Father's young son. All this is just one of the things that adds to this confusing mess of a movie! THE BABYSITTER is just to uninteresting & boring to be any good, there's no actual plot surrounding the movie & no surprises, it's just a series of fantasies the revolve around Silverstone's character. The film also switches back & forth between fantasies & what's really happening so much so that at times it's very hard to tell which scenes are real or which is fantasy, while Silverstone is sexy & plays the part well, she just can't save this flick & neither can the rest of the good actors who deserved better material to work from than this, even the most dedicated of Silverstone fans may have a hard time in defending this from it's bad reviewers, since even they will be confused & bored at what's happening on screen, heck even voyeurs will find this film hard to swallow, since if they are looking to see Silverstone nude, they will be greatly disappointed in that she never once gets naked in the film, the film from my understanding had plenty of nudity in it, but it was all chopped out of the script before shooting because Alicia would not accept the role if they weren't cut out (As any Alicia fan can tell you, She don't do nudity!) so the film makers instead of choosing another actress who would do the nudity, caved in to Silverstone's demands. The ending was also poorly written & flat & the party scene that the Wife & Husband are attending seems out of place in the film (Not to mention the Wife's fantasies about a Gentlemen she sees at the party) If you're an Alicia fan & have not seen this yet or if you're into erotic thrillers, skip this one, you will be greatly disappointed with it, not to mention bored, best to save you're money & see one of Alicia's other films, since they are so much better than this one! 0 stars

    This is the first time that I have felt compelled to share my views on this site but having watched this film I felt so irritated that I had wasted an hour & a half of my life I thought I should warn anybody else who might stumble across this laughable film. It appears that there is a reason that films are shown at 3:30 in the morning on Sky Movies & that is to try to send people to sleep. This is a tedious, nonsensical piece of tat with hysterical performances & an inane storyline. The flashback sequences (which take up most of the film) damage the flow of the film to such an extent that you end up not caring what is happening in the actual 'plot'. Alicia Silverstone does little wrong & just tends to wander around with little on. It is a testament to the stupidity of the American film industry that any of the others were allowed to work again & it is testament to my own stupidity that I watched this piece of rubbish to the end.

    The majority of movies and TV shows that came out during the 90's were awful. But there were some that were so bad they were good. This movie here falls into that category, and it's perfect for late night viewing. The reason I find this movie so bizarre and hypnotic is not Alicia Silverstone. As a matter of fact, I've never found her to be that hot, compared to other actresses. The reason this movie draws in the viewer is Nicky Katt. Before I saw this movie I had never even heard of this guy, yet he's been acting since the early 80's. I could not stop laughing whenever he was on screen. What makes it all the more strange is that he wasn't even trying to be funny. His character in the movie is supposed to be a neighborhood bully, yet when he's walking down the street with Jeremy London and smashes the bottle on the pavement trying to act tough, I laughed so hard I fell off the couch. The rest of the dream sequences throughout the film feel like TWILIGHT ZONE visions. This makes the movie all the more bizarre and fun to watch. Score, 5 out of 10 Stars

    A baby Sitter named jennifer, is so gorgeous that she has all the men around her fantasising her to all of their desires. this includes her ex boyfriend, the tuff guy swho hangs out with him, the father of the kid that she is baby sitting and one of the kids that she is baby sitting. boring, poorly made film that wreaks of that early 90's film feel. my definition of early 90's film feel? here it is: a film in which is virtually unknown to most people; actors that you will never see again after the movie you're watching; and character's personal problems that do not relate to the plot. Much of that is in this film. Nothing to see really. */****

His character in the movie is supposed to be a neighborhood bully, yet when he's walking down the street with Jeremy London and smashes the bottle on the pavement trying to act tough, I laughed so hard I fell off the couch. The rest of the dream sequences throughout the film feel like TWILIGHT ZONE visions. This makes the movie all the more bizarre and fun to watch. Score, 5 out of 10 Stars

    A baby Sitter named jennifer, is so gorgeous that she has all the men around her fantasising her to all of their desires. this includes her ex boyfriend, the tuff guy swho hangs out with him, the father of the kid that she is baby sitting and one of the kids that she is baby sitting. boring, poorly made film that wreaks of that early 90's film feel. my definition of early 90's film feel? here it is: a film in which is virtually unknown to most people; actors that you will never see again after the movie you're watching; and character's personal problems that do not relate to the plot. Much of that is in this film. Nothing to see really. */****

    Harry & Dolly, a married couple with their three children have a nanny Jennifer. One evening when the two go to a party, she comes at their home for what will be again a ordinary day of work. Her boyfriend, Jack meets Mark, a lover that Jennifer had a relationship before. They have fun that night until he tells to give his girlfriend's a call to ask her if he can go at her workplace. How things are not going well between them, she refused saying it needs more time to figure out their relationship and where it goes, anyway she can't let him come because she must take care of children. Mark not satisfied with this answer and convinces him to go there and let him still inside. But this time Jack it's not lucky, it is rejected and Mark offered him to spy her so they can see what she does until he comes to the idea wondered if she forget the door open when it was closed in the nose. The strange thing is that in reality the door is open so that the two can easily enter the house. Meanwhile, the owners are busy getting drunk at the party and Harry thinks at the nanny has his fantasies with her and looking for any excuse to go home. Find one saying that his head hurts because of so much alcohol and have to return home in order to take a pill. Meanwhile between good guy and bad guy altercation occurs which Mark wins for a moment. Drunk husband manages to reach home with the car, hit Mark, the police arrives, nanny got into the car and the question is what were you thinking? That is, what we thought when we decided to watch this movie? Of course the best are those few smiles in this movie during the dreams. But even so to see one at every 10 minutes is not quite right. Can not say anything about this film than continue to dream and change it.

    I rented this direct-to-video movie because there's Alicia Silverstone in it, and honestly I really don't understand at all the choice of making bizarre things such as this or her movie "True Crime" for example... Who would want to see that anyway, these are the kind of things I wouldn't be surprised to see if coming from writer/director Roger Vadim and actress Brigitte Bardot during the 60s before he made quality things, but not from the actress who made "Clueless" in the 90s... The tone of this one is really more inspired than Roger Vadim's movies of the 60s, it's an imitation who's more artistic and less serious, but still... In any case anybody who like rough sex or seeing a babysitter named Jennifer (played by Alicia Silverstone) in a bath full of white bubbles should watch this, otherwise it should be skipped at all cost; there's no story and no acting at all except for Alicia Silverstone...

    "The Babysitter" is about as imaginative as its title (both appear to have been recycled). It's just one of a handful of low-profile movies Alicia Silverstone made before her career took off. Here, she's a solemn, sexy-in-spite-of-herself teen trying to earn some bucks by babysitting, seemingly unaware that she has male teenagers drooling and male adults fawning. Uneven drama with ham-handed flickers of surrealism. Executive produced (for some unknown reason) by Joel Schumacher, who later directed Silverstone in 1997's "Batman and Robin". This one is strictly amateur night, despite a good supporting cast including George Segal and Lois Chiles. NO STARS from ****

    This is a truly bizarre but awesome thriller, that's quite fascinating to watch, with a unique story and fantastic performances!. All the characters are great, and it has some bizarre imaginary scenes as well, plus Alicia Silverstone is simply amazing in this!. The finale is very suspenseful and shocking, and all the characters fantasies were really quite twisted and sickening but still fascinating all the same, plus for a direct to video film this is top notch!. Nicky Katt is excellent as the asshole trouble maker as he sickened me with his actions, and some scenes really disturbed me (like the kid walking in the bathroom door to see Alicia naked in the tub, and she let him do it), and this is pretty well made and written as well, plus this should be much higher then 4.0 in my opinion. Jeremy London is also great as the lead, and I am glad I taped this on the scream channel as well, plus it Doesen't have your usual forgiveness type ending. This film will not be for everyone, and I liked the atmosphere it had in it too, plus J.T Walsh was also awesome in this. This is a truly bizarre but awesome thriller, that's quite fascinating to watch, with a unique story and fantastic performances, and I say it's a must see!. The Direction is awesome!. Guy Ferland does an awesome! job here with excellent camera work, adding some good atmosphere, and keeping the film at an engrossing pace. The Acting is excellent. Alicia Silverstone is amazing as always and is amazing here,she is incredibly gorgeous, vulnerable, extremely sexy, seductive, and also very mysterious, her character was a really good one as this is one of the most interesting roles she has played! (Silverstone Rules!!!!!!!). Jeremy London is awesome as the guy who is attracted to Alicia he was very likable, even if he did go to far at times. Nicky Katt is awesome as the asshole, he really sickened me with his actions, as I was glad he got what was coming to him at the end. J.T. Walsh is really good here, he had a bizarre but great role, his fantasies were very disturbing. Lee Garlington is decent as the wife. George Segal is rather wasted as a parent. Rest of the cast are fine. Overall a must see!. **** out of 5

    saw this movie when i was in grade school on the action channel. sliverstone did show her breasts in this movie, the reason it was cut is because there is nothing there to write home about. otherwise the movie was interesting, had a kick ass soundtrack. 'the lie still in the garden' song rocked. jeremy London and the other dude were hott. i just felt bad that the father was arrested at the end. i felt that mark had it coming. the only twisted part was when the little boy was asked by alica to wash her back. but a fanasty, not reality. her character was stupid and so was jeremy's. it was weird seeing the guy that played mark as a tough guy.

    I first saw The Babysitter when it was released all the way back in 1995, and it still holds up well today. This sleeper stars Alicia Silverstone as the babysitter, who is the obsession of many males in the film. Mr. Tucker (played by J.T. Walsh), the father of the children she babysits, lusts after her, as does her boyfriend, Jack (played by Jeremy London), and a neighborhood rebel, Mark (played by Nicky Katt). Based on a short story by Robert Coover, The Babysitter goes like this: After refusing a date with Mark, the babysitter goes to the Tucker residence on a Friday night to babysit the three children there. Jack is reading Catcher in the Rye in a diner when Mark comes along and begins to coax him into hanging out with him, which leads to the two of them spying on the babysitter while she is looking after the children. The Tuckers are at a party but Mr. Tucker finds any excuse to go home, much to the dismay of his wife, Dolly (good performance given by Lee Garlington) who herself fantasizes about Bill (played by George Segal), the party host. Many of the characters consume alcohol, and the combination of booze and their own obsessions leads to a deadly climax. The Babysitter contains many dream sequences which may be difficult to discern from the actual happenings if you are viewing for the first time. All of the players in this movie do a great job. It is very different and I recommend it.

    At least in my opinion it does. Made before she hit big time with CLUELESS, this film was released to capitalize on her "then" success. She plays a pretty babysitter who is the object of pretty much every male character in this movie When her boyfriend shows up & his friend at the house she's at we are then set for what appears to be an endless succession of sexy fantasies that all evolve around her, all of which stems from the imagination of the Father of the kids she is babysitting, the Boyfriend, his Friend, & the Father's young son. All this is just one of the things that adds to this confusing mess of a movie! THE BABYSITTER is just to uninteresting & boring to be any good, there's no actual plot surrounding the movie & no surprises, it's just a series of fantasies the revolve around Silverstone's character. The film also switches back & forth between fantasies & what's really happening so much so that at times it's very hard to tell which scenes are real or which is fantasy, while Silverstone is sexy & plays the part well, she just can't save this flick & neither can the rest of the good actors who deserved better material to work from than this, even the most dedicated of Silverstone fans may have a hard time in defending this from it's bad reviewers, since even they will be confused & bored at what's happening on screen, heck even voyeurs will find this film hard to swallow, since if they are looking to see Silverstone nude, they will be greatly disappointed in that she never once gets naked in the film, the film from my understanding had plenty of nudity in it, but it was all chopped out of the script before shooting because Alicia would not accept the role if they weren't cut out (As any Alicia fan can tell you, She don't do nudity!) so the film makers instead of choosing another actress who would do the nudity, caved in to Silverstone's demands. The ending was also poorly written & flat & the party scene that the Wife & Husband are attending seems out of place in the film (Not to mention the Wife's fantasies about a Gentlemen she sees at the party) If you're an Alicia fan & have not seen this yet or if you're into erotic thrillers, skip this one, you will be greatly disappointed with it, not to mention bored, best to save you're money & see one of Alicia's other films, since they are so much better than this one! 0 stars

    This is the first time that I have felt compelled to share my views on this site but having watched this film I felt so irritated that I had wasted an hour & a half of my life I thought I should warn anybody else who might stumble across this laughable film. It appears that there is a reason that films are shown at 3:30 in the morning on Sky Movies & that is to try to send people to sleep. This is a tedious, nonsensical piece of tat with hysterical performances & an inane storyline. The flashback sequences (which take up most of the film) damage the flow of the film to such an extent that you end up not caring what is happening in the actual 'plot'. Alicia Silverstone does little wrong & just tends to wander around with little on. It is a testament to the stupidity of the American film industry that any of the others were allowed to work again & it is testament to my own stupidity that I watched this piece of rubbish to the end.

    The majority of movies and TV shows that came out during the 90's were awful. But there were some that were so bad they were good. This movie here falls into that category, and it's perfect for late night viewing. The reason I find this movie so bizarre and hypnotic is not Alicia Silverstone. As a matter of fact, I've never found her to be that hot, compared to other actresses. The reason this movie draws in the viewer is Nicky Katt. Before I saw this movie I had never even heard of this guy, yet he's been acting since the early 80's. I could not stop laughing whenever he was on screen. What makes it all the more strange is that he wasn't even trying to be funny.

The rest of the dream sequences throughout the film feel like TWILIGHT ZONE visions. This makes the movie all the more bizarre and fun to watch. Score, 5 out of 10 Stars

    A baby Sitter named jennifer, is so gorgeous that she has all the men around her fantasising her to all of their desires. this includes her ex boyfriend, the tuff guy swho hangs out with him, the father of the kid that she is baby sitting and one of the kids that she is baby sitting. boring, poorly made film that wreaks of that early 90's film feel. my definition of early 90's film feel? here it is: a film in which is virtually unknown to most people; actors that you will never see again after the movie you're watching; and character's personal problems that do not relate to the plot. Much of that is in this film. Nothing to see really. */****
