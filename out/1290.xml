  Adaptation of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya" set in rural Australia in the 1920's. Jack Dickens and his niece Sally run the family farm to support brother-in-law Alexander as a (supposedly brilliant) literary critic in London. Action begins when Alexander returns with his beautiful young wife Deborah, revealing himself as an arrogant failure and wanting to sell the farm out from under Jack. Blakemore introduces themes about Australia's separation from England, as well as expanding the pacifist and ecological philosophies espoused by the local Doctor Max Askey.

    Michael Blakemore's "Country Life" is loosely based on Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya". Mr. Blakemore, a distinguished theater director, and actor, takes us to his native Australia, where he sets the story circa 1919. It's a time where Aussie soldiers are returning home from WWI. We watch as Alexander Voysey, who has been living abroad, returning with his new wife, Deborah, to the estate in the country where his daughter and brother-in-law are living. Voysey is a snob who seems out of place in the house that has seen better days. His young wife Deborah, is with him because obviously she needs a meal ticket. Uncle Jack, has stayed behind doing all the thankless jobs, helped by his niece Sally, who is Alexander's daughter. We also see the free thinking doctor Max Askey, whose ideas clash with the conservative town folks. It seems inevitable, but Deborah and the doctor develop a passion for one another that comes to nothing, while young Sally who secretly loves the older doctor, doesn't stand a chance with him. Ultimately, the Voyseys have had it with the place and when Alexander's plans to sell the estate to neighbors fail because Jack's protests and animosity toward his brother-in-law, who by now, we realize is a fake, decide to go west in search of greener pastures. "Country Life" is a film where we draw parallels between its Russian model and the Aussie setting. All the elements of Chekhov are there beautifully staged and directed by Michael Blakemore. The distinguished cast acts well as an ensemble under Mr. Blakemore's direction. Googie Withers makes a good contribution as the crusty cook Hannah, who knows all the secrets of the family. This is a different "Uncle Vanya", but worth a visit because of the excellent work of Mr. Blakemore.

    The Country Life is what I consider to be a pretty run-in-the-mill rich-people-go-into-the-country-and- the=country-folk-teach-them-a-lesson type of movie. Michael Blakemore and Greta Scaachi play two upper crust British folk who set foot in the beautiful Australian countryside to visit his relations that he hasn't seen forever. He's acquired much success in the city, something not lost on the country folk. However, just like me, when the spoiled rich people go into the country, it's not quite the same lifestyle. Soon, they try to change the whole house upside down, and even getting to the point where they want to sell it. The country folk, needless to say, are not amused. The plot in this is rather predictable, sort of like City Slickers meets Gosford Park. Everyone seems to have a high upper nose about the whole thing, and I HATE movies like that. The acting for this is pretty good, Michael Blakemore and Greta Scaachi are good as the city couple, and Kerry Fox and John Hargreaves (doing a damned good Eric Idle impersonation) are all pretty good. Sam Neill's character, though a necessity in the plot, I feel is somewhat needless here. Oh, and for those of you wondering, no, Blur's 'Country House' is not in the movie.

    Uncle Vanja in the Australian outback with a perfect rendering of the characters; engrossing, entertaining, and the sad ending as well. I voted it a "10". It looks like Hollywood could learn a lot from Australia.

    The first thing to do if one is to derive any pleasure from "Country "Life" is to forget Chekhov. Admittedly the film carries a disclaimer insofar as it is only "Suggested by Uncle Vanya", but having said this it is even more remote from Chekhov that Nikita Mikhalkov's "Unfinished Piece for Mechanical Piano" which carries a similar disclaimer "Themes from the works of...". This aside, "Country Life" is an agreeable piece of period soap set just after the end of the First World War with pretty visuals of New South Wales's Hunter Valley. Like "Uncle Vanya" it tells of the disruptive visit of a pretentious elderly professor-type and his attractive young second wife to the relatives of his deceased first wife living in a rundown country estate. There all resemblance ceases. Chekhov had a genius for taking a group of characters and exploring each one with equal depth so that even the eponymous Uncle Vanya is but one of several equally fascinating characters. In "Country Life" the focus of attention is placed on the elderly pedant, not unsurprisingly played by the director himself, Michael Blakemore. Would it be cynical therefore to suggest that the film becomes something of an ego trip! The rest, even the Uncle Vanya figure, are curiously colourless by comparison except for that 1940's glamour girl, Googie Withers, still going strong one is glad to see, who turns up as an elderly, domineering and tetchy family cook and almost steals the show. I cannot quite see why the film was made but at least it is harmlessly entertaining. For the real thing I went back to Stuart Burge's filmed adaptation of the Laurence Olivier 1963 Chichester Festival production of Vanya: sans very much in the way of scenery, sans music, apart from a bit of on-stage guitar stuff, monochrome and sans very much in the way of interesting camerawork and visuals, but with Laurence Olivier, Michael Redgrave, Joan Plowright, Rosemary Harris, Max Adrian, Sybil Thorndike and Lewis Casson, a cast to dream of in as powerful a piece of filmed theatre as one is likely to find anywhere.

    I saw this movie for the first time a year ago, and couldn't wait for its video release. It's a wonderful farce, a bit like "The Man Who Came to Dinner." I thoroughly enjoyed John Hargreave's "Uncle Jack" and Kerry Fox's "Sally". If this were a television program it would have me hooked! All of the characters at the Canterbury estate were given good development (even the minor ones), and I was sorry to have to leave them when the movie ended. My only complaint is that Michael Blakemore's "Alexander" and Greta Scacchi's "Deborah" did not seem to learn anything from their experiences with their relatives. They returned to their selfish, bombastic selves at the end, which made the point of the story a bit fuzzy for me. Overall, however, I would recommend this as a very good picture.

    Usually, I dislike plays adapted to a place & time other than those the author intended. Country Life (the title is from Chekhov's subtitle for Uncle Vanya, Scenes from Country Life) is a rare exception. Placed in the Australian outback in the 1920s, aspects of the play, such as the old man's writings (here, trashy theatre criticism, some of which is quoted) are as worthless as his academic treatises in the play; veneration for London (true in much of Oz, even today) makes clearer the play's characters' veneration for Moscow; etc. Blakemore, a fine stage director, knows his Chekhov, knows how to get the most of his actors (all of whom are excellent) and, to my happy surprise, knows how to make a sparkling, engrossing film from a play by Chekhov, which is very difficult (Mikhalkov is the only other one who has done it, in An Unfinished Piece for Player Piano). A thoroughly delight

    i think that chekhov has been treated badly in many theatrical productions of this play, but this film and the welsh 'uncle vanya,' AUGUST, [with anthony hopkins] are beautiful and heartfelt versions of the story...those who think this is a "disappointing" film are not getting the point...the story is, in fact, about people who are very disappointed in life and love...get it???...chekhov takes a certain patience and maturity to understand...i'm happy that both these films and VANYA ON 42ND STREET were made...chekhov's characters are deep and tragic, but also shallow and comic...just like the rest of us, eh???...give it a looksee...and a chance...

    Sally and her uncle work a sheep ranch in rural Australia, circ 1920 something. Along comes stiff and stilted Dad (Blakemore) and stepmum Debbie (Scacchi). Toss in a roaming physician, some hired help, etc. and you've got "All in the Family in the Outback". Personalities clash, eccentricities entangle, and hanky-panky ensues. "Country Life" is an endearing Aussie cum English wry and lighthearted romp which should appeal most to those who enjoy British comedy.

    The director, Michael Blakemore, takes an artistic gamble by loosely adapting Anton Chekhov's play, Uncle Vanya, to Australia. It works on his terms, with Blakemore doing a fine job as the returning native son. Greta Scacchi, whose effect on the locals as his new and young wife is presented in an effective fashion, also performs well. The direction is somewhat uneven and, as a result, the cast does not achieve an ensemble effect so important for the filmization/adaptation. Sam Neill, as is customary, plays Sam Neill. However, Kerry Fox, a brilliant actress, shines. The production design and costumes are nicely and accurately created. In sum, Blakemore does not attempt to go beyond the perimeter of the original masterwork by Chekhov who, after all, is the originator of the "slice of life" genre.
