    Paula Marshall is a delight. The movie's universe revolves around her character and if she couldn't' pull off the transitions in the straight role, Midler's and Farina's tour-de-force performances would have felt out of context. But she did. Director Carl Reiner in his last directorial credit to-date has set all the screwball romantic comedy to a fantastic classic musical score and lots of wonderful sight gags. Gail O'Grady and David Rasche Play their roles as spurned spouses for all they are worth. The actor playing the paparazzi reporter had such good chemistry with Marshall that they married in real life. This movie made me laugh more than any romantic comedy since Crossing Delancey.

    I can't believe they made this movie in 1997. It seems one of those 80's comedies. Which is not bad in itself, just the fact it somehow seems really dated. Everything seems to have done before. And audience have seen this many times before. Both Bette Midler and Dennis Farina have played many similar characters lots of times. Just within a few minutes you can guess what is going to happen. Script is predictable and clich&eacute;d, dialogs are cheesy straight from 80's. I am just surprised how this movie got to be made. The movie title itself serves as a warning. While watching this movie you also get that old feeling that you have seen it all before.

    Dennis Farnina and Bette Midler are the best chemistry match for this outrageously screwball comedy. Attending their daughter's wedding, after 14 years of being divorced from each other, and remarrying, the two despise each other and pull absolutely no punches. After a major screaming match at the reception, the two are put out in the street and told to calm down. It is at this point that the old feeling captures them and the picture becomes an absolute madcap comedy. The duo run off and are pursued by the daughter, and a photographer who can't stop snapping pictures of Midler. While on their escapades, the daughter realizes that she has feelings for the photographer. She has married into a political Republican family who pride themselves on good family values. Some values. While waiting for his bride to return, the young husband gets drunk and has a one-night fling with Farina's second wife! The ending is an absolute pip in the tradition of the 1930 screwball comedies. This is a marvelously crafted film- one of the best of this type that I've seen in years.

    A young woman invites her parents to her wedding, knowing that they absolutely hate each other and haven't spoken in 14 years. Warning them not to ruin her wedding by making a scene, they agree to her demands, for her sake. But we all know that won't last long... This is a sweet comedy but is utterly unintertaining and absurdly boring in some parts. The acting is hideous, the lines are cheesy, the story is boring and the end is laughable. Imagine "Father of the bride" without any funny or touching moments, coupled with watching paint dry.

    When I read the synopsis for this film on the t.v. channel, I immediately assumed it was one of those "screwball comedies" of the 1930s. Instead, it turned out to be a "modern" screwball comedy which kept us glued to the screen the whole time. Everything about the film was so enjoyable: the acting of everyone, and above all the clever writing, managing to relate all the main characters in the filmic version of a quadrille. By the looks of things, I would guess that everyone involved thoroughly enjoyed themselves in the making of this film. As always, Bette Midler was supreme, whilst this film yet again showed how brilliant and versatile an actor is Dennis Farina.

    This was a fun movie. Admittedly, it was not the best film ever made, but it hangs together well enough, and is quite enjoyable. Molly DeMora (Paula Marshall) is about to marry Keith Marks (Jamie Denton), the rather stuffy son of a Replubican Senator. Unfortunately for Molly, this means that she will have to invite both of her parents, who have been divorced since she was a little girl, and still don't get along well. Her mother, Lilly Leonard (Bette Midler), is a famous actress who is now married to a psycho-babbling therapist, Alan (David Rasche). Her father, Dan DeMora (Dennis Farina) is a famous writer who has married Rowena (Gail O'Grady), the woman he left Lilly for. Molly expects some sparks to fly between her parents, but the ones that do surprise even her, as they rekindle their romance (in an hilarious scene involving a rocking Volkswagen), and leave the reception together. Unfortunately, Keith fears that these kinds of antics will cause a scandal, something detrimental to both his career and his father's. So, he rather sternly orders Molly to handle the situation, which she does, with a paparazzo photographer (Danny Nucci) hot on her tail. However, as Molly tries to bring her parents to their senses, she starts to wonder if maybe they shouldn't be together after all - and if maybe she doesn't belong with Keith. Admittedly, it's a silly story. In spite of that, it's still a well written one, and a well acted movie. Midler is hilarious as always. Farina shows an ability to charm even while playing for laughs. Nucci does a great job of showing a decent human being in spite of the slimy way he makes a living. Denton is wonderfully stuffy. But the best performance is Marshall, who seems to have an absolute gift for comedy. Yes, it's a silly movie, but every now and then, you need a silly little diversion, and this is just the thing for those times.

    ***SPOILERS, OK?!?! SHEESH, GET OVER IT!*** I have extremely high expectations for movies. Unbelievably high expectations - unreasonably high. This picture meets - and even exceeds - expectations. Predictable? Yeah, but so what? You know that Molly's parents are going to end up together in the end. And you know Molly isn't going to end up staying married to the congressman. Who cares? That's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie, is Molly, her heart and soul. She's so tightly wound, she's about a quarter of an inch away from blowing a gasket. For anyone who's grown up trying to keep their head straight while their parents were off being crazy, you'll identify with her instantly. She's so self-loathing, trying to run her world and feeling like she's failed any time any little thing goes wrong, that she can't even see that her husband doesn't love her. Now, it's not that she's self-absorbed. In fact, quite the opposite. She's totally and completely giving of herself. Too much so; this is what comes about from a lifetime of having to keep other people's sh*t together. But she's simply not in tune with herself and her feelings, because of all the noise from all emotional sh*t going on inside her. Slowly but surely, bit by bit, she loosens up. And it's not the kind of loosening up where somebody just tells you, "hey, relax, don't be so stressed out, everything's cool!", and the hero realizes, "hey, all I have to do is relax, and not be so stressed out, and everything will be cool - that's terrific!". I hate those kinds of movies, they're insulting. That's not how sh*t changes. It's the kind of loosening up that happens slowly, subtly, without her (or the viewer) even noticing it. A slight shift here, a small turn there, a little diversion inside herself. Bit by bit, she goes from having a hurricane inside her head to feeling some bright, clear sunshine for a change. It happens without her even realizing it. You won't realize it either. That's why people can't figure out why they like this movie. It just kind of sneaks up on you, then BAM! So relax, set your intellect on cruise control, and allow yourself to be fulfilled by a charming, wonderful film.

    This is a lovely romp without a wasted moment. The often quite broad comedy is believable due to the great script and fine acting. The story cuts to the chase in a way that is refreshing (see the scene where Lilly and Dan go outside at the wedding). The leads are all appealing, especially Danny Nucci and Paula Marshall as an unlikely duo and Bette Midler and Dennis Farina, who are evidently having a fabulous time. This is just flat out enjoyable and well-written, the way a lot of comedies were in the golden days of Hollywood. And like those great classic comedies, this is not a sappy sentimental story with any false nobility. People admit to not being perfect. They don't try to be anything they're not - or if they do they are quickly deflated. The underlying theme is "be true to yourself and don't get sucked into the boring b.s. of life." This is the kind of subversive edge that the great screwballs had, right down to including a pompous wannabe politician and a gold-digging second wife. Bravo. If only they'd make more like this. How about a sequel or the same team coming back together for another project?

    This movie just saved my day - I know this is not a movie for everyone, but I fell in love with in the first minutes. This movie has the certain "something", which I find rare in movies these days - you can clearly see that everyone has had great fun doing this. Bette Midler and Dennis Farina pull out the best roles, and the casting is awesome overall. I might just be naive, but this film kept surprising me all the time, and I can't recall the last time any movie has gone by so fast. There is not great depths in the plot, it's just plain old 'feel good have fun' hour and a half ! Worked for me, went straight into my top ten !

    I can't believe they made this movie in 1997. It seems one of those 80's comedies. Which is not bad in itself, just the fact it somehow seems really dated. Everything seems to have done before. And audience have seen this many times before. Both Bette Midler and Dennis Farina have played many similar characters lots of times. Just within a few minutes you can guess what is going to happen. Script is predictable and clich&eacute;d, dialogs are cheesy straight from 80's. I am just surprised how this movie got to be made. The movie title itself serves as a warning. While watching this movie you also get that old feeling that you have seen it all before.

    Dennis Farnina and Bette Midler are the best chemistry match for this outrageously screwball comedy. Attending their daughter's wedding, after 14 years of being divorced from each other, and remarrying, the two despise each other and pull absolutely no punches. After a major screaming match at the reception, the two are put out in the street and told to calm down. It is at this point that the old feeling captures them and the picture becomes an absolute madcap comedy. The duo run off and are pursued by the daughter, and a photographer who can't stop snapping pictures of Midler. While on their escapades, the daughter realizes that she has feelings for the photographer. She has married into a political Republican family who pride themselves on good family values. Some values. While waiting for his bride to return, the young husband gets drunk and has a one-night fling with Farina's second wife! The ending is an absolute pip in the tradition of the 1930 screwball comedies. This is a marvelously crafted film- one of the best of this type that I've seen in years.

    A young woman invites her parents to her wedding, knowing that they absolutely hate each other and haven't spoken in 14 years. Warning them not to ruin her wedding by making a scene, they agree to her demands, for her sake. But we all know that won't last long... This is a sweet comedy but is utterly unintertaining and absurdly boring in some parts. The acting is hideous, the lines are cheesy, the story is boring and the end is laughable. Imagine "Father of the bride" without any funny or touching moments, coupled with watching paint dry.

    When I read the synopsis for this film on the t.v. channel, I immediately assumed it was one of those "screwball comedies" of the 1930s. Instead, it turned out to be a "modern" screwball comedy which kept us glued to the screen the whole time. Everything about the film was so enjoyable: the acting of everyone, and above all the clever writing, managing to relate all the main characters in the filmic version of a quadrille. By the looks of things, I would guess that everyone involved thoroughly enjoyed themselves in the making of this film. As always, Bette Midler was supreme, whilst this film yet again showed how brilliant and versatile an actor is Dennis Farina.

    this is the kind of movie that i try to remember with a fondness even in excess to how i really feel about it, just to make up for the fact that i often fail to make any real converts to my strange passion for movies that work better than they should. That Old Feeling is a good example (others I could cite: My Fellow Americans, Odd Couple II) of just how hard it is to really convey the intimacy that certain long-term rancor breeds... Denise Farina (who first entered my hall of fame in Get Shorty, because he nailed it, the way he abuses Gene Hackman, the huge oft-broken nose...brilliant). And Bette needn't reprove herself to me, and though I'm hardly a die-hard fan, there's something so vibrant about Bette Middler as she negotiates her raging trysts with her loathed ex...That friction, the movie suggests, is central to any sort of authentic passion. And, like any closet-romantic, I am dazzled by the knowledge that Paula Marshall (Molly, the newlywed) ended up getting married to her costar Danny Nucci (plays a paparazzi following around Molly's mom--Bette Midler) a few years after shooting on the film wrapped. chemistry is crucial.

    This was a fun movie. Admittedly, it was not the best film ever made, but it hangs together well enough, and is quite enjoyable. Molly DeMora (Paula Marshall) is about to marry Keith Marks (Jamie Denton), the rather stuffy son of a Replubican Senator. Unfortunately for Molly, this means that she will have to invite both of her parents, who have been divorced since she was a little girl, and still don't get along well. Her mother, Lilly Leonard (Bette Midler), is a famous actress who is now married to a psycho-babbling therapist, Alan (David Rasche). Her father, Dan DeMora (Dennis Farina) is a famous writer who has married Rowena (Gail O'Grady), the woman he left Lilly for. Molly expects some sparks to fly between her parents, but the ones that do surprise even her, as they rekindle their romance (in an hilarious scene involving a rocking Volkswagen), and leave the reception together. Unfortunately, Keith fears that these kinds of antics will cause a scandal, something detrimental to both his career and his father's. So, he rather sternly orders Molly to handle the situation, which she does, with a paparazzo photographer (Danny Nucci) hot on her tail. However, as Molly tries to bring her parents to their senses, she starts to wonder if maybe they shouldn't be together after all - and if maybe she doesn't belong with Keith. Admittedly, it's a silly story. In spite of that, it's still a well written one, and a well acted movie. Midler is hilarious as always. Farina shows an ability to charm even while playing for laughs. Nucci does a great job of showing a decent human being in spite of the slimy way he makes a living. Denton is wonderfully stuffy. But the best performance is Marshall, who seems to have an absolute gift for comedy. Yes, it's a silly movie, but every now and then, you need a silly little diversion, and this is just the thing for those times.

    ***SPOILERS, OK?!?! SHEESH, GET OVER IT!*** I have extremely high expectations for movies. Unbelievably high expectations - unreasonably high. This picture meets - and even exceeds - expectations. Predictable? Yeah, but so what? You know that Molly's parents are going to end up together in the end. And you know Molly isn't going to end up staying married to the congressman. Who cares? That's not the point of the movie. The point of the movie, is Molly, her heart and soul. She's so tightly wound, she's about a quarter of an inch away from blowing a gasket. For anyone who's grown up trying to keep their head straight while their parents were off being crazy, you'll identify with her instantly. She's so self-loathing, trying to run her world and feeling like she's failed any time any little thing goes wrong, that she can't even see that her husband doesn't love her. Now, it's not that she's self-absorbed. In fact, quite the opposite. She's totally and completely giving of herself. Too much so; this is what comes about from a lifetime of having to keep other people's sh*t together. But she's simply not in tune with herself and her feelings, because of all the noise from all emotional sh*t going on inside her. Slowly but surely, bit by bit, she loosens up. And it's not the kind of loosening up where somebody just tells you, "hey, relax, don't be so stressed out, everything's cool!", and the hero realizes, "hey, all I have to do is relax, and not be so stressed out, and everything will be cool - that's terrific!". I hate those kinds of movies, they're insulting. That's not how sh*t changes. It's the kind of loosening up that happens slowly, subtly, without her (or the viewer) even noticing it. A slight shift here, a small turn there, a little diversion inside herself. Bit by bit, she goes from having a hurricane inside her head to feeling some bright, clear sunshine for a change. It happens without her even realizing it. You won't realize it either. That's why people can't figure out why they like this movie. It just kind of sneaks up on you, then BAM! So relax, set your intellect on cruise control, and allow yourself to be fulfilled by a charming, wonderful film.

    This is a lovely romp without a wasted moment. The often quite broad comedy is believable due to the great script and fine acting. The story cuts to the chase in a way that is refreshing (see the scene where Lilly and Dan go outside at the wedding). The leads are all appealing, especially Danny Nucci and Paula Marshall as an unlikely duo and Bette Midler and Dennis Farina, who are evidently having a fabulous time. This is just flat out enjoyable and well-written, the way a lot of comedies were in the golden days of Hollywood. And like those great classic comedies, this is not a sappy sentimental story with any false nobility. People admit to not being perfect. They don't try to be anything they're not - or if they do they are quickly deflated. The underlying theme is "be true to yourself and don't get sucked into the boring b.s. of life." This is the kind of subversive edge that the great screwballs had, right down to including a pompous wannabe politician and a gold-digging second wife. Bravo. If only they'd make more like this. How about a sequel or the same team coming back together for another project?

    This movie just saved my day - I know this is not a movie for everyone, but I fell in love with in the first minutes. This movie has the certain "something", which I find rare in movies these days - you can clearly see that everyone has had great fun doing this. Bette Midler and Dennis Farina pull out the best roles, and the casting is awesome overall. I might just be naive, but this film kept surprising me all the time, and I can't recall the last time any movie has gone by so fast. There is not great depths in the plot, it's just plain old 'feel good have fun' hour and a half ! Worked for me, went straight into my top ten !
