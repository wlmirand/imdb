 <sinopse>
  Homicide detective John Hobbes witnesses the execution of serial killer Edgar Reese. Soon after the execution the killings start again, and they are very similar to Reese's style.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Det. John Hobbes is convinced that when killer Edgar Reese is executed, all of his troubles are over. But when people he knows and people on the street start to sing the same tune that Reese sang in the gas chamber, and those same people taunt him, he is told that maybe the cursed fallen angel Azazel is behind it all. Azazel is cursed to roam the Earth without a form, and he can switch bodies by any contact, making him hard to track. When Hobbes is forced to kill a man possessed by Azazel, he must clear his name while protecting his family and others from the evil, vengeful Azazel.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

    This movie was pretty cool so cool i paused it so many times that at one single frame when paused i was blowin away from what i was looking at?? In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    Philadelphia Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) witnesses the execution of a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who is sent to the electric chair . Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to &uml;Seven&uml; including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for &uml;Crouching tiger , hidden dragon&uml;. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as &uml;Fracture&uml;, &uml;Frecuency&uml;, &uml;Hart's war&uml;; his greatest hit is &uml;Primal fear&uml; . Rating : 6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

    This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    Philadelphia Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) witnesses the execution of a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who is sent to the electric chair . Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to &uml;Seven&uml; including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for &uml;Crouching tiger , hidden dragon&uml;. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as &uml;Fracture&uml;, &uml;Frecuency&uml;, &uml;Hart's war&uml;; his greatest hit is &uml;Primal fear&uml; . Rating : 6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

    This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

    This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    Philadelphia Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) witnesses the execution of a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who is sent to the electric chair . Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to &uml;Seven&uml; including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for &uml;Crouching tiger , hidden dragon&uml;. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as &uml;Fracture&uml;, &uml;Frecuency&uml;, &uml;Hart's war&uml;; his greatest hit is &uml;Primal fear&uml; . Rating : 6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

    This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

    This movie was pretty cool so cool i paused it so many times that at one single frame when paused i was blowin away from what i was looking at?? In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    Philadelphia Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) witnesses the execution of a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who is sent to the electric chair . Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to &uml;Seven&uml; including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for &uml;Crouching tiger , hidden dragon&uml;. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as &uml;Fracture&uml;, &uml;Frecuency&uml;, &uml;Hart's war&uml;; his greatest hit is &uml;Primal fear&uml; . Rating : 6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

In this single frame in the middle of the TV is a demon or devil with 2 eyes and above it just to the right is an angel which appears to have slitly blond hair which looks to be either grabing the demon or holding it, in the lower corner above the angel there is another demon and all the way to the the lower right is an upside down demon very crazy my question is was this put into the movie or was it just there its towards the very end use your remote fast its a one second frame or faster pause many times between 1:47:40 and 1:47:41 keep pausing it and every thing i just explained is in this single quick frame its a 10th of a second so pause it many times, pretty trippy i hope the board post this you will be shocked at what you see!

    Philadelphia Homicide detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) witnesses the execution of a serial killer named Edgar Reese (Elias Koteas) who is sent to the electric chair . Before dieing Reese unleashes an evil spirit called Azabel . Having captured the murderous , Hobbes is convinced that cops are the chosen people and he turns up on television smiling and proud . Soon after the execution the killings start again , and they are very similar to Reese's style . Azabel's aggressive spirit is passed along with touch , as a fluid is taken into the bodies , in a crowed city of Philadelphia anyone can become villain . Things get worse , however , when Hobbes is drawn to the biblical injunction 'hide your works' and strange words on walls and corpses . This thrilling film written by Nicholas Kazan packs intrigue , action , chills , suspense , twists and turns . Hybrid of cop-thriller and supernatural story contains solid interpretations and eerie atmosphere similarly to &uml;Seven&uml; including a surprising final . On a metaphorical level , this does sense AIDS and a fear of the city are central to the 90s . Very good Denzel Washington as an obstinate cop who becomes involved about cruel ominous copycat murders but slow to realize an explanation beyond the normal . Magnificent support from John Goodman , Donald Sutherland , James Gandolfini , Elias Koteas , Robert Joy , Gabriel Casseus and special mention to Embeth Davidtz . Colorful cinematography in Panavision by Newton Thomas Sigel, including the fidgety camera zooms in fascinating way . Thrilling musical score fitting to action by Tan Dumb who the next year would win Academy Award for &uml;Crouching tiger , hidden dragon&uml;. The motion picture is well directed by Gregory Hoblit , a fine professional who works as TV , he's co-producer with Steven Bochco , as Cinema in successful pictures such as &uml;Fracture&uml;, &uml;Frecuency&uml;, &uml;Hart's war&uml;; his greatest hit is &uml;Primal fear&uml; . Rating : 6,5 . Good film , but some moments doesn't pay off and takes much too long to get where it's going . Worthwhile watching .

    Someone saw The First Power a couple decades back and thought "Gee if you throw a 'Name' actor in the mix and some hooky stuff and you've got a hit!". Well not so fast Chief, I'm not sure how profitable Fallen was but at least it is a pretty good serial killer flick with distinct supernatural and theological undertones. Detective John Hobbes (Denzel Washington) inhabits the Lou Diamond Phillips role. He too is an expert in identifying and tracking down serial killers, he too is celebrating a great 'get' in the form of Reese (Elias Koteas), an especially heinous individual who took great delight in taunting his pursuers, often calling Hobbes at home just as a tease. Even in captivity Reese is still cocky and brash, citing using obscure references harking back to eras long since past to bait and bait Hobbes in foreign tongues all the way up until his execution. Well that's that then. Not really. Shortly after the execution a new killer appears, one that seems to be mimicking Reeses' modus operandi all the way down to the late night phone calls to Hobbes' home that he shared with his brother and nephew. Hobbes and his detective colleagues Jones (John Goodman) and Lou (James Gandolfini) jump on the case, with Stanton (Donald Sutherland) overseeing the precinct. Hobbes follows the trail closely, all the way back to a murder case over thirty years old with startling parallels to the present day. This leads him to Greta (Embeth Davitz) the daughter of a cop implicated in the old case, who warns Hobbes off the entire thing, telling him to stay away for the benefit of his family and everyone he knows. But that would mean half a film, so Hobbes doggedly continues on, at certain locations he seems to receive messages  directions almost  that impel him forward, seemingly closer to uncovering the truth Which is where the supernatural elements kick in, elements that I have deliberately not mentioned here as half the fun is in discovering them. Denzel is solid as always in the central role, remaining stoic and professional even in the face of mounting evidence that he is facing a foe that is decidedly 'other'. The supporting cast are all fine in their roles  Koteas standing out in a role that demands he play things over the top  and even as the situation grows tighter and more desperate the filmmakers manage to keep the tone straight and as realistic as the plot line allows. I liked Fallen, it was very effective in building tension in a few early sequences as the truth is gradually drip fed to you, and the finale was quite good, especially considering that the film began to lose steam in the second third of the film. Was it necessary to make practically the same film as The First Power only with a bigger budget and Denzel to lend credibility and box office clout? No. Is it better or more memorable than The First Power? Not really. Is it worth a look? Yep. Especially if you were one of the few who actually liked The First Power. If you've never heard of it and liked this, look it up. Final Rating  6.5 / 10. Touchy feely strangers singing Rolling Stones songs would be strange and disturbing if you weren't in the midst of a murder case. Here they just cap things off.

    This movie is almost identical in plot to The First Power. One of the main differences is that the antagonist in The First Power was a powerful human, while Azazel in Fallen is a demon. Basically, they both possess bodies and turn them against the hero. In The First Power, the antagonist can really only change bodies by killing the first and then, once free, inhabiting the next. Azazel can pass bodies by simply touching, though there are some who he cannot possess simply by touching. The idea is that when the angels rebelled, some were cast out and denied bodies, so they survive by possessing people (and animals) and if they are out of a body for too long then they die. Thus there is only one way to defeat it. Isolated the possessed body from anybody else and kill the body. This is much difficult than it sounds, especially since nobody really believes in them anyway. I really found this movie to be quite long and boring. Okay, the antagonist was okay, taunting the hero constantly, and there is an interesting twist at the end, but other than that, the movie doesn't really stand out all that much. Basically, the movie opens with a voice saying, "I'll tell you about the time that I almost died." And we see the hero crawling through the snow. Thus we are led to assume that the hero is the one telling the story. The movie is narrated, and as far as we can tell, it is the hero as it is his voice and it seems to focus on him. Thus, in that way it is quite good, but otherwise the movie is just plain average.

    I have seen this film before and pretty much enjoyed it. Noticing it in the TV schedules recently, I thought I'd give it another go and put some thoughts down about it this time. A film that is not widely hailed as a horror film, I found it both atmospheric and quite menacing. To me a good horror film pays on the audiences' fear of the unknown, and this film does just that. I'll tell you more after this brief summary. When serial killer, Edgar Reese, is about to be executed, he asks to speak to the detective that caught him, John Hobbes. Gloating at Hobbes, he begins to speak in some foreign language and finally bursts into song; The Rolling Stones, 'Time is on my Side'. Thinking nothing of this, Hobbes proceeds to witness the execution, but it's not the last he'll see of Edgar Reese, or is it Edgar Reese? A day later Hobbes is called to the scene of a murder, a murder that has all the hallmarks of Edgar Reese. Does he have an accomplice, or is there a copycat out there? Either way, it's a puzzle that has to be solved and one that will lead Hobbes and his partner, Jonesy, down a very perilous path. I won't say any more or the Spoiler Police (demonic branch) will be possessing my family and turning them against me. A well made film with a very interesting narration and a delightful twist at the end. Great performances all round, especially from Denzel Washington as John Hobbes, John Goodman as Jonesy and Embeth Davidtz as Gretta Milano. Honourable mentions go to Donald Sutherland as Lt. Stanton and James Gandolfini (with an outrageous moustache) as Lou. I very much enjoyed this film although it did fall a little flat about two thirds of the way through and I did find it a little over-long. Other than that I found it quite an intelligent film that keeps you guessing right until the end. It's one that will be overlooked by many (low gore factor), but one I would encourage any horror fan to watch. It has quite a slow pace, but don't be deceived, it's quite enthralling if you give it a chance Recommended. My Score: 7.6/10. IMDb Score: 6.8/10 (based on 30,255 votes at the time of going to press). Rotten Tomatoes Score: 40/100 (based on 55 reviews counted at the time of going to press).

    Well if anyone has ever read any of my reviews they will know I just think Denzil is great..I first saw this film years ago,and I now have it on DVD..cost me one BP.a bargain.This film is I suppose a semi horror come thriller,the plot is about a serial killer who Denzil has caught and witnesses his execution, what he doesn't know is the man is possessed by a demon who can jump from body to body.So when the killings continue after the execution with the same modus operandi, Hobbs(Denzil) has to investigate, it soon becomes apparent that the demon(Azazel) wants to destroy Hobbs...and the battle commences.Its got a well balanced cast,and suspense is maintained throughout the film..and the ending is pretty cool too...I said that it is only a semi horror film...and I have watched many films with more gore,and many more scares, but for me personally this film gets to me,it might not you, but it does me.All in all worth watching,with an unusual story and a twist to finish.

    I think Fallen is a somewhat underrated supernatural thriller. There should probably be a list somewhere for underrated films. This would be on it. It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.

    Fallen is your kind of standard supernatural thriller. You could see the ending coming from a mile away though but I was looking forward to it. I don't know about others but when the hero sacrifices himself to save others it always lets me leave a movie happy and sad at the same time. This didn't happen at the end of this movie though. You get to the end ready to see the hero make the noble sacrifice, but instead the demon survives by entering the body of a cat. All the lead up and hints to that moment throughout the entire movie are wasted and put to shame with this stupid ending. Sure some people may like when the hero falls short, but not many do this was a movie full of potential but is utterly ruined with a horrible ending. It is a 2 hour waste of time because of the ending, had Hobbs actually stopped the demon this movie would be one I would recommend people to watch. But once again a movie is ruined because someone along the line decided hey lets have a massive twist right at the end so it totally destroys everything we have been building up too in the last 2 hours of the film and makes it all pointless, yeah people will love that. If you are a fan of stupid endings then this is a movie for you if you prefer endings that don't spit on the last 2 hours of the movie you have been watching then give this one a miss.

It has a good cast, good plot and some clever direction. It's not perfect, and could have done with a little bit extra here and there, but it's certainly worth your time if you're a fan of slow-burning thrillers. Detective John Hobbs (Denzel Washington) has caught a killer. That killer has been sentenced to death. Before dying, the killer warns Hobbs that he'll be watching him. The killer is executed. Hobbs gets on with his life. That is, until another murder is committed - one that is a copycat, one that suggests the original serial killer had an accomplice, or a fan. Hobbs starts to battle the killer, but finds evidence that suggests the killer isn't human, but is a demon that possesses humans and kills to bring about the fall of civilization. Hobbs and the demon begin a game of cat and mouse that leads to Hobbs being suspected of murder himself, and a final, chilling and clever climax. This film is an effective thriller, because it has a good story to begin with. It's not one that's entirely original(demonic possessions have been done before), but Nicholas Kazan's script has enough in it to make it solid and interesting. There is some very credible dialogue, some good plot twists and some good characterization. There is also a solid twist at the end. To build upon the good script, there is also some good acting. Donald Sutherland gives a good, credible performance as the 'couldn't care less' boss who is trying only to cover himself. He in turn is upstaged by John Goodman, who gives a very strong performance as Jonesy, Hobbs' faithful partner. Finally, the direction is strong and sometimes inventive. You get a real feel for the streets of Philadelphia and the countryside around it. More importantly, you get a real feel for the demon because of the good techniques used to portray it. There are some downsides, unfortunately, which do prevent this from being a notch higher. At times, the pace of the film is a little too slow. And because it's just a little too slow, it's easy to lose track of what's happening and why. I feel certainly towards the hour mark, that this needed a little more power and pace behind it. It also could have done with a bit more in terms of the supernatural side - sometimes the demon was underused. I also think that this doesn't represent Denzel Washington at his best. He never seems to really get into this role as much as he could have done. He normally steals a film when he's in it - but this time he's upstaged by Donald Sutherland and John Goodman, who are far more credible in their roles. Finally, the use of the Rolling Stones music detracts from the supernatural element. I am a Stones fan - but their music wasn't right for this movie. Overall, this is underrated and is worth watching if you like a slow burner. But it could have been a bit better quite easily.

    A supernatural thriller without any special effects is unusual but this one has nothing except the odd change of camera lens. The plot is OK, a fairly simple good versus evil story, and the pace is decent, never too slow for long although never very quick. The problem is the lack of personality of any of the characters, you have a good cast wasted. Washington is the only one given any real screen time but he doesn't bring any depth to the character, he tries but the script just isn't good enough. The rest of the cast are in the same boat, they are completely two dimensional. Even the villain of the story has nothing to offer, no humour, no creepiness and no real dialogue. The ending is darker than I was expecting but other than that quite predictable. Pretty boring.

    D. Washington plays detective Hobbs in a slow moving murder mystery. The story centers on a demon that takes control of people through touch or spirit and uses them to commit murders. The problem is demons do not operate that way; they simply do not have the authority to fill your body against your will and take control. Demonic possession occurs through a series of steps where people open themselves up or invite demons in. At any rate, if I could watch the movie as a blank slate it would still be slow and leave too many loose ends for my liking. Plus the bad guy wins and I never can get too excited about that.
