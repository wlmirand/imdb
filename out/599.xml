    Firstly, the script kicks ass! It's a local story, authentic dialogs, fast paced, straight forward and realistic, yet entertaining. Most of all, it got lots of authentic local cultures in it and it stands out. (Plz don't make movies just for the foreigners markets, draw foreign markets with your local culture - remember the success of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Mr. Vampire series, & recently Pang Brothers movies???!!!) What stands out is the time frame of the storyline is longer than most movies out there in the same genre and yet you don't feel bored or awkward. All the actors and actresses' performances' are so natural and believable. Don't know why, but it makes it so much relaxing to watch. Even the cameos all ditched in and made the movie better bit by bit. Thirdly, the director is very smart in the sense that he acknowledged that he didn't have the luxury of getting the support from Jackie Chan's stuntmen group. Thus, you can't stuff the whole movie with those crazy stunts. Instead, he created a lot of exciting action scenes from various authentic settings - shoot em all scene from the worn down factory building, the underground banking, and the HK underground subway systems. It's jam packed with action, drama, terrific fight scenes. In all it's a great movie because everyone in the movie knows what they're doing and did very well. It may not have the Hollywood production $$$ but definitely more entertaining than their recycled story lines & movie stars. It's a celebration of HK movie during the 90s era! Top notch real S!#$% hk police action crime movie!!! 9/10!!! A must see! Go rent it today!!! (I bet Banlieue 13 stole some ideas from movies like this one =)

    This film was released in 1993. I saw it not long after its release. I was very young when I first saw this film. Obviously, I felt compelled to watch it because Jackie was in it. However, as I first sat through the film, I thought it was extremely boring. The fight scenes were choppy. There were not many scenes that left indelible marks in my memory. Of course I have seen Michelle Yeoh in Supercop. But, I have never quite looked up to her as a great martial artist cum actress. * that is not to say that Michelle Yeoh is a completely untalented MA and actress though * Michelle's fighting style -- at least, her on-screen persona -- comprises of kicks and punches. That is normal. Yes, she would tumble, flip, leap, etc. These are normal too for Hong Kong film productions. But, the one critical element that sets Project S apart from other Hong Kong films -- Jackie's Police Stories included -- is the detailed storyline and plots. Her character, Yu Rongguang's, Emil Chau's, Fan Siu Wong's, and others were deftly crafted and executed. The scene where Michelle sprints to her bike on the parade field -- that is a beautifully done scene. For a military officer who has to remain steadfast in character, then suddenly runs because she was afraid of not being able to send off her lover, the act in itself speaks a lot about Michelle's character and the dramatic elements involved. The raid on the robbers' hideout at the shophouse was also a memorable scene. A team of former soldiers pitted against regular cops -- this scene should have no problems in enticing anyone to at least feel curious, to learn of the eventual outcome from the confrontation. Finally, the scene in the railway tunnel. Seeing Yu Rongguang's character at his end, his previous lies exposed; no longer was he the good man that he wanted Michelle's character to think he was. Then, to sacrifice himself for the sake of his lover, all these are emotional-ladened and intricate moments that uniquely distinguish Project S. This beautiful film subsequently concludes with a song sung by Emil Chau / Wakin Chau. I mean, how can anyone not feel anything when he / she sits through such a beautifully written film the like of Project S? :)

    I guess as a generic Hong Kong movie it's okay .. but if you are expecting some high powered karate then you'll be disappointed. Not being very well versed in karate movies, I figured I can't go wrong with Michelle Yeoh. I loved her in the Bond movie, and was hoping for something similar. No such luck. I guess if you want to see Michelle strut around in a uniform, sit at a computer or talk endlessly with her fellow agents, then this is the film for you. What little she does (in the opening scenes especially) is great, and she shows agility, grace and strength. But it's WAY TOO CHATTY. Another problem seems to be that she doesn't win many fights.... she usually needs an assist from somebody .. In my opinion, that ain't right. She's the star. She's the reason to watch. It would be as if James Bond needed Miss Moneypenny to haul his butt out of danger most the time ... If anyone could suggest a good female based movie like this I'd appreciate it ... It's funny how the Jackie Chan movies have almost non-stop action, but the few female based movies I've seem are top-loaded with sideline love interests, over-the-top goony comic characters and other "filler" .... At least, that's based on what little I've seen.

    This follow-up to "Police Story 3" is not nearly as good as its predecessor, despite having the same director (Stanley Tong). Although it is supposed to be a starring vehicle for Michelle Yeoh, she has surprisingly little to do. She gets about 3 fight scenes in the entire film (she does show her awesome flexibility in those at least), and is absent during many of the climactic set-pieces! The whole movie seems to favor (dryly directed) gunplay over martial arts, and although there are some spectacular stunts, they are pretty much par for the course for Hong Kong cinema. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the relationship between Yeoh and the bad guy who sincerely loves her, but the ending resolves that in a rather too-convenient way. Jackie Chan has a 2-minute scene that is so outrageously silly you can't help but laugh; also watch out for a brief appearance by Yukari Oshima during the opening action sequence. (**)

    Depending on your whereabouts in the world, this film may go under any one of the following titles: Supercop 2 (USA), Once a Cop, Police Story 3 Part 2, Police Story 4: Project S, Police Story V, Project S (UK), Supercop (also UK). Whatever the title, do not be fooled into thinking that this is a Jackie Chan film; yes, he does appear in the movie, but only briefly and in a scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. Michelle Yeoh, however, plays the same character as she did in Police Story 3 (which was known as Supercop in the US and did star JCÂ—are you keeping up?), a hard-as-nails mainland Chinese cop named Yang. She is called to Hong Kong to lend her expertise and assist in the apprehension of a gang of Chinese criminals who are pulling heists right left and centre and peeing-off the local cops. The police operations are going swimmingly until Yang recognises one of the criminals as Cheng Feng, her boyfriend from China who left for HK to find his fortune, and the two become reacquainted under somewhat difficult circumstances. With a decidedly routine plot, Project S needed to be something special in the action department in order to compensate, but despite some cracking fight action towards the end, there is far too much quiet time spent between bouts. The action is also geared towards gun-play rather than martial arts, so those expecting a full on fight-fest will be disappointed. That is not to say that Yeoh and co-stars don't display some wonderful skills from time to time; the high kicking action is pretty good when it happensÂ—it just doesn't happen often enough. The final half an hour, which has the gang attempt a daring bank robbery, offers the best dose of action, with Yang going up against a foe twice her size (and kicking ass, of course!). Director Stanley Tong and star Michelle Yeoh have both made far better films than this, but if your expectations are not set too high, you may find Project S a reasonable way to spend your time (although 105 minutes was a tad too long for me!).

    With a crime spree occurring across Hong Kong, and all the crimes traced to the work of one major crime syndicate, the police look to focus their resources. Having recently proved how tough and resourceful she is, Officer Hua Yang is sent to help a couple of detectives. It becomes immediately evident that the group is a lot more organised than they expected but Hua shakes off her adviser role and takes direct action Â– but when she discovers that the leader of the group is none other than one Ah Fung, Hua's old boyfriend. On the basis of the wonderful Michelle Yeoh being in it, I decided to give this film a go to see if it was any good. From the very start I was amused to see how cheap it looked, although it may have aged a little bit as well. As with all these type of films, plot usually comes second to the action and here is no different. The story is not that well delivered and I found myself with too many characters to care about and too little logic in the plot. It did jump around a bit and it relied too heavily on the former relationship between Jessica and Ah Â– but it never bothered to really make us care about either of them as real people or get emotionally involved with them as was necessary if this method was to work. Sadly it didn't work and the film was quite unengaging for the most part. Of course with good action scenes this shouldn't matter too much, but it doesn't do anything that special on the action front. This is not to suggest it is no good, because the gun play and various fights are reasonably good, it is just that they don't really do anything special and they do lack a certain amount of style. The fights do feel like they were done on a budget and, like the rest of the film, they did lack imagination and effort. The cast didn't do anything that good but in fairness my version was badly dubbed so it is hard to tell. Yeoh is a great actress who I have seen been playful, exciting, sensitive and tragic in many films but here she has nothing to do although one or two of her fight scenes hint at her ability. I never really got into the characters played by Sui-Wong, Yu and Chau as they didn't make much of an impression, although I thought that Wei was good. Bill Tung is there in a small role and does his usual stuff but were they really so desperate to attract an audience that they had to make Jackie Chan demean himself in an unfunny drag cameo? Overall this is an average film at best. The presence of one or two famous names suggests that it will be better than average but in reality it is all a bit workmanlike and lacking effort. The plot relies on the characters being developed and, when they're not, it means that it isn't very engaging as a story. The action is OK but nothing special and I never went 'wow' or anything like that. The script is average and the performances (dubbed or not) didn't really do anything to improve on the situation Â– Yeoh in particular was disappointingly bland for large sections.

    When i saw this movie i was really mad because i had bought it on DVD, thinking it was a great movie... Well i was wrong. This is not a great movie... at all. What could have been a great hong kong action movie is in reality a low budget "american action movie" with Asians playing all the roles. The hong kong movies i love in the martial arts genre is the ones where the action is clear, fight scenes are shot at a wide angle and with few cuts so you get pretty long sequences where you see everything the fighters do. In this movie however, they use closeups and fast cuts, usually seen in movies where they are trying to hide the fact that the actors can't fight. But we all know Michelle Yeoh can fight so why they have done this is beyond me. The lousy fight scenes ruined the entire movie for me i am a afraid. I rate this movie 4/10

    Â‘Supercop 2', the sequel to Â‘Police Story 3: Supercop' from the same director Stanley Tong, is more than just a sequel. To me, it seems slightly superior to the (still of course very entertaining!) first movie. It has a different approach altogether, because the first movie was basically about full speed action and amazing stunts like we are used from Jackie Chan's movies. Michelle Khan in her role as a police officer from China helped him along. In some ways, it was a `buddy movie' with one buddy being an extremely tough girl! In the second movie, Michelle Khan is the star. Jackie only has a small guest appearance in a silly and unnecessary scene. Â‘Supercop 2' gets a lot more serious than its predecessor. The tragedy motif: Michelle realizes her ex-boyfriend has become a criminal and now works for a gang of high-tech bank robbers. The characterization is surprisingly detailed, down to small things like choosing a wrong present for someone you love but not completely understand, and the ending (Will she shoot him? Or will she let him escape?) had me sit on the edge of my seat... My favourite scene is Michelle's fight against one of the mercenaries: a 7 feet giant trying to hit a 5 feet girl, and you bet he's getting his butt kicked really hard Â– I've never seen something like this before. Hah, take this, Rambo! Probably this movie was an important step for Michelle Khan (a.k.a. Yeoh) on her way to the Bond movie `Tomorrow Never Dies'. Very recommendable, unless you only watch movies for being a Jackie Chan completist, and don't care about any other qualities in a movie, like a few other reviewers here seem to do, I'm afraid.

    I have a great respect for Michelle Yeoh. I have only seen her in a few films but she does impress me. Unfortunately, this movie was a victim of Dimension Films (aka Disney) milking the Jackie Chan money machine. They throw a sequel like title on it and even say Jackie Chan also stars in it. Guess what? He only makes a two minute cameo. The main problem with film companies in the States is that they use JC as a device to get people to rent or buy a video. They bill him as the main star when he really isn't (I fell victim to this when I bought 36 Crazy Fists, rented The Prisoner aka Island of Fire, and rented the subpar Gen Y Cops featuring Paul Rudd). It is misleading and Im sure even Jackie hates that. In this one, he doesn't show up until midway into the film. His appearance really serves no purpose. The plot to this film is paper thin and boring. Bill Tung, who appears as the police chief, only is on the screen for a short time as well. Yeoh is capable of so much better, and Supercop 2 is far from her best. Stick with Police Story 3: Supercop and skip this.

As with all these type of films, plot usually comes second to the action and here is no different. The story is not that well delivered and I found myself with too many characters to care about and too little logic in the plot. It did jump around a bit and it relied too heavily on the former relationship between Jessica and Ah Â– but it never bothered to really make us care about either of them as real people or get emotionally involved with them as was necessary if this method was to work. Sadly it didn't work and the film was quite unengaging for the most part. Of course with good action scenes this shouldn't matter too much, but it doesn't do anything that special on the action front. This is not to suggest it is no good, because the gun play and various fights are reasonably good, it is just that they don't really do anything special and they do lack a certain amount of style. The fights do feel like they were done on a budget and, like the rest of the film, they did lack imagination and effort. The cast didn't do anything that good but in fairness my version was badly dubbed so it is hard to tell. Yeoh is a great actress who I have seen been playful, exciting, sensitive and tragic in many films but here she has nothing to do although one or two of her fight scenes hint at her ability. I never really got into the characters played by Sui-Wong, Yu and Chau as they didn't make much of an impression, although I thought that Wei was good. Bill Tung is there in a small role and does his usual stuff but were they really so desperate to attract an audience that they had to make Jackie Chan demean himself in an unfunny drag cameo? Overall this is an average film at best. The presence of one or two famous names suggests that it will be better than average but in reality it is all a bit workmanlike and lacking effort. The plot relies on the characters being developed and, when they're not, it means that it isn't very engaging as a story. The action is OK but nothing special and I never went 'wow' or anything like that. The script is average and the performances (dubbed or not) didn't really do anything to improve on the situation Â– Yeoh in particular was disappointingly bland for large sections.

    When i saw this movie i was really mad because i had bought it on DVD, thinking it was a great movie... Well i was wrong. This is not a great movie... at all. What could have been a great hong kong action movie is in reality a low budget "american action movie" with Asians playing all the roles. The hong kong movies i love in the martial arts genre is the ones where the action is clear, fight scenes are shot at a wide angle and with few cuts so you get pretty long sequences where you see everything the fighters do. In this movie however, they use closeups and fast cuts, usually seen in movies where they are trying to hide the fact that the actors can't fight. But we all know Michelle Yeoh can fight so why they have done this is beyond me. The lousy fight scenes ruined the entire movie for me i am a afraid. I rate this movie 4/10

    Â‘Supercop 2', the sequel to Â‘Police Story 3: Supercop' from the same director Stanley Tong, is more than just a sequel. To me, it seems slightly superior to the (still of course very entertaining!) first movie. It has a different approach altogether, because the first movie was basically about full speed action and amazing stunts like we are used from Jackie Chan's movies. Michelle Khan in her role as a police officer from China helped him along. In some ways, it was a `buddy movie' with one buddy being an extremely tough girl! In the second movie, Michelle Khan is the star. Jackie only has a small guest appearance in a silly and unnecessary scene. Â‘Supercop 2' gets a lot more serious than its predecessor. The tragedy motif: Michelle realizes her ex-boyfriend has become a criminal and now works for a gang of high-tech bank robbers. The characterization is surprisingly detailed, down to small things like choosing a wrong present for someone you love but not completely understand, and the ending (Will she shoot him? Or will she let him escape?) had me sit on the edge of my seat... My favourite scene is Michelle's fight against one of the mercenaries: a 7 feet giant trying to hit a 5 feet girl, and you bet he's getting his butt kicked really hard Â– I've never seen something like this before. Hah, take this, Rambo! Probably this movie was an important step for Michelle Khan (a.k.a. Yeoh) on her way to the Bond movie `Tomorrow Never Dies'. Very recommendable, unless you only watch movies for being a Jackie Chan completist, and don't care about any other qualities in a movie, like a few other reviewers here seem to do, I'm afraid.

    I have a great respect for Michelle Yeoh. I have only seen her in a few films but she does impress me. Unfortunately, this movie was a victim of Dimension Films (aka Disney) milking the Jackie Chan money machine. They throw a sequel like title on it and even say Jackie Chan also stars in it. Guess what? He only makes a two minute cameo. The main problem with film companies in the States is that they use JC as a device to get people to rent or buy a video. They bill him as the main star when he really isn't (I fell victim to this when I bought 36 Crazy Fists, rented The Prisoner aka Island of Fire, and rented the subpar Gen Y Cops featuring Paul Rudd). It is misleading and Im sure even Jackie hates that. In this one, he doesn't show up until midway into the film. His appearance really serves no purpose. The plot to this film is paper thin and boring. Bill Tung, who appears as the police chief, only is on the screen for a short time as well. Yeoh is capable of so much better, and Supercop 2 is far from her best. Stick with Police Story 3: Supercop and skip this.

    Firstly, the script kicks ass! It's a local story, authentic dialogs, fast paced, straight forward and realistic, yet entertaining. Most of all, it got lots of authentic local cultures in it and it stands out. (Plz don't make movies just for the foreigners markets, draw foreign markets with your local culture - remember the success of Jackie Chan, Bruce Lee, Mr. Vampire series, & recently Pang Brothers movies???!!!) What stands out is the time frame of the storyline is longer than most movies out there in the same genre and yet you don't feel bored or awkward. All the actors and actresses' performances' are so natural and believable. Don't know why, but it makes it so much relaxing to watch. Even the cameos all ditched in and made the movie better bit by bit. Thirdly, the director is very smart in the sense that he acknowledged that he didn't have the luxury of getting the support from Jackie Chan's stuntmen group. Thus, you can't stuff the whole movie with those crazy stunts. Instead, he created a lot of exciting action scenes from various authentic settings - shoot em all scene from the worn down factory building, the underground banking, and the HK underground subway systems. It's jam packed with action, drama, terrific fight scenes. In all it's a great movie because everyone in the movie knows what they're doing and did very well. It may not have the Hollywood production $$$ but definitely more entertaining than their recycled story lines & movie stars. It's a celebration of HK movie during the 90s era! Top notch real S!#$% hk police action crime movie!!! 9/10!!! A must see! Go rent it today!!! (I bet Banlieue 13 stole some ideas from movies like this one =)

    This film was released in 1993. I saw it not long after its release. I was very young when I first saw this film. Obviously, I felt compelled to watch it because Jackie was in it. However, as I first sat through the film, I thought it was extremely boring. The fight scenes were choppy. There were not many scenes that left indelible marks in my memory. Of course I have seen Michelle Yeoh in Supercop. But, I have never quite looked up to her as a great martial artist cum actress. * that is not to say that Michelle Yeoh is a completely untalented MA and actress though * Michelle's fighting style -- at least, her on-screen persona -- comprises of kicks and punches. That is normal. Yes, she would tumble, flip, leap, etc. These are normal too for Hong Kong film productions. But, the one critical element that sets Project S apart from other Hong Kong films -- Jackie's Police Stories included -- is the detailed storyline and plots. Her character, Yu Rongguang's, Emil Chau's, Fan Siu Wong's, and others were deftly crafted and executed. The scene where Michelle sprints to her bike on the parade field -- that is a beautifully done scene. For a military officer who has to remain steadfast in character, then suddenly runs because she was afraid of not being able to send off her lover, the act in itself speaks a lot about Michelle's character and the dramatic elements involved. The raid on the robbers' hideout at the shophouse was also a memorable scene. A team of former soldiers pitted against regular cops -- this scene should have no problems in enticing anyone to at least feel curious, to learn of the eventual outcome from the confrontation. Finally, the scene in the railway tunnel. Seeing Yu Rongguang's character at his end, his previous lies exposed; no longer was he the good man that he wanted Michelle's character to think he was. Then, to sacrifice himself for the sake of his lover, all these are emotional-ladened and intricate moments that uniquely distinguish Project S. This beautiful film subsequently concludes with a song sung by Emil Chau / Wakin Chau. I mean, how can anyone not feel anything when he / she sits through such a beautifully written film the like of Project S? :)

    I guess as a generic Hong Kong movie it's okay .. but if you are expecting some high powered karate then you'll be disappointed. Not being very well versed in karate movies, I figured I can't go wrong with Michelle Yeoh. I loved her in the Bond movie, and was hoping for something similar. No such luck. I guess if you want to see Michelle strut around in a uniform, sit at a computer or talk endlessly with her fellow agents, then this is the film for you. What little she does (in the opening scenes especially) is great, and she shows agility, grace and strength. But it's WAY TOO CHATTY. Another problem seems to be that she doesn't win many fights.... she usually needs an assist from somebody .. In my opinion, that ain't right. She's the star. She's the reason to watch. It would be as if James Bond needed Miss Moneypenny to haul his butt out of danger most the time ... If anyone could suggest a good female based movie like this I'd appreciate it ... It's funny how the Jackie Chan movies have almost non-stop action, but the few female based movies I've seem are top-loaded with sideline love interests, over-the-top goony comic characters and other "filler" .... At least, that's based on what little I've seen.

    This follow-up to "Police Story 3" is not nearly as good as its predecessor, despite having the same director (Stanley Tong). Although it is supposed to be a starring vehicle for Michelle Yeoh, she has surprisingly little to do. She gets about 3 fight scenes in the entire film (she does show her awesome flexibility in those at least), and is absent during many of the climactic set-pieces! The whole movie seems to favor (dryly directed) gunplay over martial arts, and although there are some spectacular stunts, they are pretty much par for the course for Hong Kong cinema. The most interesting aspect of the movie is the relationship between Yeoh and the bad guy who sincerely loves her, but the ending resolves that in a rather too-convenient way. Jackie Chan has a 2-minute scene that is so outrageously silly you can't help but laugh; also watch out for a brief appearance by Yukari Oshima during the opening action sequence. (**)

    Depending on your whereabouts in the world, this film may go under any one of the following titles: Supercop 2 (USA), Once a Cop, Police Story 3 Part 2, Police Story 4: Project S, Police Story V, Project S (UK), Supercop (also UK). Whatever the title, do not be fooled into thinking that this is a Jackie Chan film; yes, he does appear in the movie, but only briefly and in a scene that has absolutely nothing to do with the rest of the film. Michelle Yeoh, however, plays the same character as she did in Police Story 3 (which was known as Supercop in the US and did star JCÂ—are you keeping up?), a hard-as-nails mainland Chinese cop named Yang. She is called to Hong Kong to lend her expertise and assist in the apprehension of a gang of Chinese criminals who are pulling heists right left and centre and peeing-off the local cops. The police operations are going swimmingly until Yang recognises one of the criminals as Cheng Feng, her boyfriend from China who left for HK to find his fortune, and the two become reacquainted under somewhat difficult circumstances. With a decidedly routine plot, Project S needed to be something special in the action department in order to compensate, but despite some cracking fight action towards the end, there is far too much quiet time spent between bouts. The action is also geared towards gun-play rather than martial arts, so those expecting a full on fight-fest will be disappointed. That is not to say that Yeoh and co-stars don't display some wonderful skills from time to time; the high kicking action is pretty good when it happensÂ—it just doesn't happen often enough. The final half an hour, which has the gang attempt a daring bank robbery, offers the best dose of action, with Yang going up against a foe twice her size (and kicking ass, of course!). Director Stanley Tong and star Michelle Yeoh have both made far better films than this, but if your expectations are not set too high, you may find Project S a reasonable way to spend your time (although 105 minutes was a tad too long for me!).

    With a crime spree occurring across Hong Kong, and all the crimes traced to the work of one major crime syndicate, the police look to focus their resources. Having recently proved how tough and resourceful she is, Officer Hua Yang is sent to help a couple of detectives. It becomes immediately evident that the group is a lot more organised than they expected but Hua shakes off her adviser role and takes direct action Â– but when she discovers that the leader of the group is none other than one Ah Fung, Hua's old boyfriend. On the basis of the wonderful Michelle Yeoh being in it, I decided to give this film a go to see if it was any good.
