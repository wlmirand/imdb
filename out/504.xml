    Bonnie Parker(played by Faye Dunaway) & Clyde Barrow(played by Warren Beatty) are a depression era couple who commit a brazen series of bank robberies across the Midwest. They are eventually joined by Clyde's brother Buck(played by Gene Hackman) his wife Blanche(Estelle Parsons) and a gas station attendant named C. W. Moss(Michael J. Pollard). All are on a collision course with a violent end as the manhunt(led by Denver Pyle) closes in on them... Popular and trend-setting film is ultimately all style over substance; well-acted by stars playing unlikable people who deserve what they get. Film seems to be as along for the ride as the supporting characters, rather than portraying their dead-end and violent crime spree as something to be condemned. Imagine the film told from the POV of the authorities to see what I mean...

    Bonnie and Clyde (1967) Bonnie and Clyde the people are now legends and the movie is just as legendary and respectable, unlike the people. Written with a lot of meat to its bones: emotionally, entertainingly, and intellectually, Bonnie and Clyde is a dazzling movie. There is something about the directing here that latches onto the viewer, bites them like a mosquito and then suddenly it consumes them. This movie is the mark of something special. It's a finely well- rounded in the way that it communicates to the audience and what its saying. Like the mosquito bite analogy, it sticks around for a while and stirs in your mind. Technically aside, it's a blast to watch, too. The title characters are one heck of a movie couple and are entertaining people to spend time with. Both lead performances contribute to the film's staggering success, and for me Warren Beatty delivers a volcanic smash of a portrayal and is one of the best things about the movie. As the writing, action, and romance, technically it was ahead of its time, thankfully, which make the many action scenes stand and significant. Bonnie and Clyde is a captivating film that stands as one of the defining movies that advanced the industry and the genre of action movies. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Bonnie and Clyde was made in 1967. It was Directed by Arthur Penn...this was only his 5th movie. Penn delivers a magnificent motion picture, that is still great to watch...to-day. Warren Beatie and ..newcomer..Faye Dunawaye as the two 1930s unconventional robbers are "very loosely based" on the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. It doesn't really matter...how completely different the characters were, or how changed the story is. What is important is the pure class of this wild and bloody adventure. This a great movie for every reason you can think of...that makes a great movie. Strangely...when it was released it was heavily criticized (even those "intellegent critics" who right little stories about film were lost.) After it did take off (word of mouth is stronger than critical non-sense) it soared into the consciousnesses of those who ever wondered what American law was like in the Depression era. And those who were curious about human existence. A fabulous 10 star Classic.

    In taking a good look at the movies that made American cinema in one way or the other, "Bonnie And Clyde" glitters in its own way. It's one of the very first films that started the New Hollywood movement, one of the most dense periods in the history of film. Based on the real story of Bonnie and Clyde, two bank robbers active in 1930's Texas, the film stars Warren Beatty (who also produces) and Faye Dunaway, in her first major role. Clyde has just been released in prison when he meets Bonnie by chance. Immediately fascinated by the exciting lifestyle Clyde has to endure, she flees with him, and together they run all over the American South robbing banks. Along with them they soon pick up a timid mechanic to help them, and Clyde's brother Buck meets them and joins them along with his wife. The five of them are now famed by the press and are being hunted all over, so it becomes harder and harder for the bunch to find peace for even one night. Beatty and Dunaway's duet is almost iconic now: together, Bonnie and Clyde symbolize the "gangster couple" that many films have been inspired by years later. Although the honor of best actor in the film would have to go to Gene Hackman playing Buck, the couple steals the screen and wins the favor of the audience from the get-go. But the movie has been influential also for its visual style, a credit to be attributed to director Arthur Penn, who was on his fifth film. Violence here was considered graphic and especially crude at the time, and as a consequence it initiated the trend of highlighting violence during the New Hollywood years, a trend that still today is extremely popular and is even more highlighted and crude. Sex plays another controversial factor, not really for its depiction ( there's not much to see), but for the fact that Clyde seems almost asexual and not willing to engage in a romance with Bonnie. Of course, this is not one of the most popular kind of relationships seen on the big screen. "Bonnie And Clyde" has aged perfectly well, and although it's not a movie with much replay value in this reviewer's eyes, it still ought to hold the important position it currently holds in movie history. It's to say the least that it's been an influential picture for many, and represents the beginning of an essential chapter of American pop culture.

    Bonnie and Clyde being about a fate-formed couple who originated as complete and total opposites and end up becoming the states' outlaws making their way into fugitives, is a very intelligent way to be remembered. This film is the reference film to so many things known today and seeing this film, now I know why. They were in love. And yet again, the message "You Can't Help Who You Love" is in this film as well as other films recently watched. The film was so well-made and beautifully put together that this movie is legendary. To bad the younger youth of today's society won't have a great understanding of what this film really and truly meant.

    I love this movie! I can honestly watch it over and over again. This film has great photography and great dialog. The costumes really allow the audience's imagination to flow towards the time period being portrayed. The film gives an adrenaline rush that is so natural; it takes you back a bit. I feel as though many people like this film because it is not realistic, it is sort of fantasy.However, the costumes and the simplistic nature of the film itself allows for audiences to forget that it is indeed fantasy. sooner before later, you are caught on the ride. You forget about the realism and your mind is stimulated off of the thoughts of something like this actually happening. The fact that love is thrown in the mix creates for an immediate attention grabber. This movie incorporates love and tons of action and violence. this captures not only women but men as well. great flick!

    I really enjoyed watching this film! I thought it was paced perfectly and the complexity of the characters and the story kept me interested the whole way through. The fact that this film was made a couple of years after the actual events had happened made it that much cooler to watch. I had previously researched the real Bonnie & Clyde, so I thought the film was a neat adaptation of the events. The actors in this film are what really made it as great as it was. Beatty and Faye have great chemistry in this film and I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Also, their redheaded sidekick was a wonderful addition that helped add a but of personality to the film. The sound in this movie was great. There were many gunshots and dialogue that often overlapped one another, but I thought that it went along with the film really well.

    Bonnie and Clyde is a very classic film which follows the story of the two ruthless bankrobbers.That actually terrorized the u.s. a couple decades before the movie came out. I Like how the movie is based off of factual people it gives it more of a sense of realism.Both actors do a great job at portraying the hardnose criminals as well as showing there love for each other and that they were willing to go against the world. The movie editing was done well as well as the scenes. The lighting in this film is very good to.both actors seemed to fit into their role perfectly it was a very enjoyable film to watch. I would recommended it to any crime drama movie lover.

    This movie is a bit surreal. It is so interesting how crime in portrayed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are watching it. The cinematography is stunning in this movie as well. The scenes were all done really well. It is very interesting to see how this film portrays real life. It can be realistic at parts, and unrealistic at other parts. The acting was superb in this film, and it made the movie that much better. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes crime, drama, suspense, and action. Its a perfect mix of all of those things. Add in the good plot, the good acting, and good cinematography, and this is a really good film. A must watch for all.

    This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.

    In taking a good look at the movies that made American cinema in one way or the other, "Bonnie And Clyde" glitters in its own way. It's one of the very first films that started the New Hollywood movement, one of the most dense periods in the history of film. Based on the real story of Bonnie and Clyde, two bank robbers active in 1930's Texas, the film stars Warren Beatty (who also produces) and Faye Dunaway, in her first major role. Clyde has just been released in prison when he meets Bonnie by chance. Immediately fascinated by the exciting lifestyle Clyde has to endure, she flees with him, and together they run all over the American South robbing banks. Along with them they soon pick up a timid mechanic to help them, and Clyde's brother Buck meets them and joins them along with his wife. The five of them are now famed by the press and are being hunted all over, so it becomes harder and harder for the bunch to find peace for even one night. Beatty and Dunaway's duet is almost iconic now: together, Bonnie and Clyde symbolize the "gangster couple" that many films have been inspired by years later. Although the honor of best actor in the film would have to go to Gene Hackman playing Buck, the couple steals the screen and wins the favor of the audience from the get-go. But the movie has been influential also for its visual style, a credit to be attributed to director Arthur Penn, who was on his fifth film. Violence here was considered graphic and especially crude at the time, and as a consequence it initiated the trend of highlighting violence during the New Hollywood years, a trend that still today is extremely popular and is even more highlighted and crude. Sex plays another controversial factor, not really for its depiction ( there's not much to see), but for the fact that Clyde seems almost asexual and not willing to engage in a romance with Bonnie. Of course, this is not one of the most popular kind of relationships seen on the big screen. "Bonnie And Clyde" has aged perfectly well, and although it's not a movie with much replay value in this reviewer's eyes, it still ought to hold the important position it currently holds in movie history. It's to say the least that it's been an influential picture for many, and represents the beginning of an essential chapter of American pop culture.

    Bonnie and Clyde being about a fate-formed couple who originated as complete and total opposites and end up becoming the states' outlaws making their way into fugitives, is a very intelligent way to be remembered. This film is the reference film to so many things known today and seeing this film, now I know why. They were in love. And yet again, the message "You Can't Help Who You Love" is in this film as well as other films recently watched. The film was so well-made and beautifully put together that this movie is legendary. To bad the younger youth of today's society won't have a great understanding of what this film really and truly meant.

    I love this movie! I can honestly watch it over and over again. This film has great photography and great dialog. The costumes really allow the audience's imagination to flow towards the time period being portrayed. The film gives an adrenaline rush that is so natural; it takes you back a bit. I feel as though many people like this film because it is not realistic, it is sort of fantasy.However, the costumes and the simplistic nature of the film itself allows for audiences to forget that it is indeed fantasy. sooner before later, you are caught on the ride. You forget about the realism and your mind is stimulated off of the thoughts of something like this actually happening. The fact that love is thrown in the mix creates for an immediate attention grabber. This movie incorporates love and tons of action and violence. this captures not only women but men as well. great flick!

    Bonnie and Clyde is a very classic film which follows the story of the two ruthless bankrobbers.That actually terrorized the u.s. a couple decades before the movie came out. I Like how the movie is based off of factual people it gives it more of a sense of realism.Both actors do a great job at portraying the hardnose criminals as well as showing there love for each other and that they were willing to go against the world. The movie editing was done well as well as the scenes. The lighting in this film is very good to.both actors seemed to fit into their role perfectly it was a very enjoyable film to watch. I would recommended it to any crime drama movie lover.

    This movie is a bit surreal. It is so interesting how crime in portrayed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are watching it. The cinematography is stunning in this movie as well. The scenes were all done really well. It is very interesting to see how this film portrays real life. It can be realistic at parts, and unrealistic at other parts. The acting was superb in this film, and it made the movie that much better. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes crime, drama, suspense, and action. Its a perfect mix of all of those things. Add in the good plot, the good acting, and good cinematography, and this is a really good film. A must watch for all.

    This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.

    Bonnie Parker(played by Faye Dunaway) & Clyde Barrow(played by Warren Beatty) are a depression era couple who commit a brazen series of bank robberies across the Midwest. They are eventually joined by Clyde's brother Buck(played by Gene Hackman) his wife Blanche(Estelle Parsons) and a gas station attendant named C. W. Moss(Michael J. Pollard). All are on a collision course with a violent end as the manhunt(led by Denver Pyle) closes in on them... Popular and trend-setting film is ultimately all style over substance; well-acted by stars playing unlikable people who deserve what they get. Film seems to be as along for the ride as the supporting characters, rather than portraying their dead-end and violent crime spree as something to be condemned. Imagine the film told from the POV of the authorities to see what I mean...

    Bonnie and Clyde (1967) Bonnie and Clyde the people are now legends and the movie is just as legendary and respectable, unlike the people. Written with a lot of meat to its bones: emotionally, entertainingly, and intellectually, Bonnie and Clyde is a dazzling movie. There is something about the directing here that latches onto the viewer, bites them like a mosquito and then suddenly it consumes them. This movie is the mark of something special. It's a finely well- rounded in the way that it communicates to the audience and what its saying. Like the mosquito bite analogy, it sticks around for a while and stirs in your mind. Technically aside, it's a blast to watch, too. The title characters are one heck of a movie couple and are entertaining people to spend time with. Both lead performances contribute to the film's staggering success, and for me Warren Beatty delivers a volcanic smash of a portrayal and is one of the best things about the movie. As the writing, action, and romance, technically it was ahead of its time, thankfully, which make the many action scenes stand and significant. Bonnie and Clyde is a captivating film that stands as one of the defining movies that advanced the industry and the genre of action movies. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Bonnie and Clyde was made in 1967. It was Directed by Arthur Penn...this was only his 5th movie. Penn delivers a magnificent motion picture, that is still great to watch...to-day. Warren Beatie and ..newcomer..Faye Dunawaye as the two 1930s unconventional robbers are "very loosely based" on the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. It doesn't really matter...how completely different the characters were, or how changed the story is. What is important is the pure class of this wild and bloody adventure. This a great movie for every reason you can think of...that makes a great movie. Strangely...when it was released it was heavily criticized (even those "intellegent critics" who right little stories about film were lost.) After it did take off (word of mouth is stronger than critical non-sense) it soared into the consciousnesses of those who ever wondered what American law was like in the Depression era. And those who were curious about human existence. A fabulous 10 star Classic.

    Bonnie and Clyde is a very classic film which follows the story of the two ruthless bankrobbers.That actually terrorized the u.s. a couple decades before the movie came out. I Like how the movie is based off of factual people it gives it more of a sense of realism.Both actors do a great job at portraying the hardnose criminals as well as showing there love for each other and that they were willing to go against the world. The movie editing was done well as well as the scenes. The lighting in this film is very good to.both actors seemed to fit into their role perfectly it was a very enjoyable film to watch. I would recommended it to any crime drama movie lover.

    This movie is a bit surreal. It is so interesting how crime in portrayed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are watching it. The cinematography is stunning in this movie as well. The scenes were all done really well. It is very interesting to see how this film portrays real life. It can be realistic at parts, and unrealistic at other parts. The acting was superb in this film, and it made the movie that much better. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes crime, drama, suspense, and action. Its a perfect mix of all of those things. Add in the good plot, the good acting, and good cinematography, and this is a really good film. A must watch for all.

    This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.

    Bonnie Parker(played by Faye Dunaway) & Clyde Barrow(played by Warren Beatty) are a depression era couple who commit a brazen series of bank robberies across the Midwest. They are eventually joined by Clyde's brother Buck(played by Gene Hackman) his wife Blanche(Estelle Parsons) and a gas station attendant named C. W. Moss(Michael J. Pollard). All are on a collision course with a violent end as the manhunt(led by Denver Pyle) closes in on them... Popular and trend-setting film is ultimately all style over substance; well-acted by stars playing unlikable people who deserve what they get. Film seems to be as along for the ride as the supporting characters, rather than portraying their dead-end and violent crime spree as something to be condemned. Imagine the film told from the POV of the authorities to see what I mean...

    Bonnie and Clyde (1967) Bonnie and Clyde the people are now legends and the movie is just as legendary and respectable, unlike the people. Written with a lot of meat to its bones: emotionally, entertainingly, and intellectually, Bonnie and Clyde is a dazzling movie. There is something about the directing here that latches onto the viewer, bites them like a mosquito and then suddenly it consumes them. This movie is the mark of something special. It's a finely well- rounded in the way that it communicates to the audience and what its saying. Like the mosquito bite analogy, it sticks around for a while and stirs in your mind. Technically aside, it's a blast to watch, too. The title characters are one heck of a movie couple and are entertaining people to spend time with. Both lead performances contribute to the film's staggering success, and for me Warren Beatty delivers a volcanic smash of a portrayal and is one of the best things about the movie. As the writing, action, and romance, technically it was ahead of its time, thankfully, which make the many action scenes stand and significant. Bonnie and Clyde is a captivating film that stands as one of the defining movies that advanced the industry and the genre of action movies. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

    Bonnie and Clyde was made in 1967. It was Directed by Arthur Penn...this was only his 5th movie. Penn delivers a magnificent motion picture, that is still great to watch...to-day. Warren Beatie and ..newcomer..Faye Dunawaye as the two 1930s unconventional robbers are "very loosely based" on the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. It doesn't really matter...how completely different the characters were, or how changed the story is. What is important is the pure class of this wild and bloody adventure. This a great movie for every reason you can think of...that makes a great movie. Strangely...when it was released it was heavily criticized (even those "intellegent critics" who right little stories about film were lost.) After it did take off (word of mouth is stronger than critical non-sense) it soared into the consciousnesses of those who ever wondered what American law was like in the Depression era. And those who were curious about human existence. A fabulous 10 star Classic.

    In taking a good look at the movies that made American cinema in one way or the other, "Bonnie And Clyde" glitters in its own way. It's one of the very first films that started the New Hollywood movement, one of the most dense periods in the history of film. Based on the real story of Bonnie and Clyde, two bank robbers active in 1930's Texas, the film stars Warren Beatty (who also produces) and Faye Dunaway, in her first major role. Clyde has just been released in prison when he meets Bonnie by chance. Immediately fascinated by the exciting lifestyle Clyde has to endure, she flees with him, and together they run all over the American South robbing banks. Along with them they soon pick up a timid mechanic to help them, and Clyde's brother Buck meets them and joins them along with his wife. The five of them are now famed by the press and are being hunted all over, so it becomes harder and harder for the bunch to find peace for even one night. Beatty and Dunaway's duet is almost iconic now: together, Bonnie and Clyde symbolize the "gangster couple" that many films have been inspired by years later. Although the honor of best actor in the film would have to go to Gene Hackman playing Buck, the couple steals the screen and wins the favor of the audience from the get-go. But the movie has been influential also for its visual style, a credit to be attributed to director Arthur Penn, who was on his fifth film. Violence here was considered graphic and especially crude at the time, and as a consequence it initiated the trend of highlighting violence during the New Hollywood years, a trend that still today is extremely popular and is even more highlighted and crude. Sex plays another controversial factor, not really for its depiction ( there's not much to see), but for the fact that Clyde seems almost asexual and not willing to engage in a romance with Bonnie. Of course, this is not one of the most popular kind of relationships seen on the big screen. "Bonnie And Clyde" has aged perfectly well, and although it's not a movie with much replay value in this reviewer's eyes, it still ought to hold the important position it currently holds in movie history. It's to say the least that it's been an influential picture for many, and represents the beginning of an essential chapter of American pop culture.

    Bonnie and Clyde being about a fate-formed couple who originated as complete and total opposites and end up becoming the states' outlaws making their way into fugitives, is a very intelligent way to be remembered. This film is the reference film to so many things known today and seeing this film, now I know why. They were in love. And yet again, the message "You Can't Help Who You Love" is in this film as well as other films recently watched. The film was so well-made and beautifully put together that this movie is legendary. To bad the younger youth of today's society won't have a great understanding of what this film really and truly meant.

    I love this movie! I can honestly watch it over and over again. This film has great photography and great dialog. The costumes really allow the audience's imagination to flow towards the time period being portrayed. The film gives an adrenaline rush that is so natural; it takes you back a bit. I feel as though many people like this film because it is not realistic, it is sort of fantasy.However, the costumes and the simplistic nature of the film itself allows for audiences to forget that it is indeed fantasy. sooner before later, you are caught on the ride. You forget about the realism and your mind is stimulated off of the thoughts of something like this actually happening. The fact that love is thrown in the mix creates for an immediate attention grabber. This movie incorporates love and tons of action and violence. this captures not only women but men as well. great flick!

The fact that this film was made a couple of years after the actual events had happened made it that much cooler to watch. I had previously researched the real Bonnie & Clyde, so I thought the film was a neat adaptation of the events. The actors in this film are what really made it as great as it was. Beatty and Faye have great chemistry in this film and I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Also, their redheaded sidekick was a wonderful addition that helped add a but of personality to the film. The sound in this movie was great. There were many gunshots and dialogue that often overlapped one another, but I thought that it went along with the film really well.

    Bonnie and Clyde was made in 1967. It was Directed by Arthur Penn...this was only his 5th movie. Penn delivers a magnificent motion picture, that is still great to watch...to-day. Warren Beatie and ..newcomer..Faye Dunawaye as the two 1930s unconventional robbers are "very loosely based" on the real Bonnie Parker and Clyde Barrow. It doesn't really matter...how completely different the characters were, or how changed the story is. What is important is the pure class of this wild and bloody adventure. This a great movie for every reason you can think of...that makes a great movie. Strangely...when it was released it was heavily criticized (even those "intellegent critics" who right little stories about film were lost.) After it did take off (word of mouth is stronger than critical non-sense) it soared into the consciousnesses of those who ever wondered what American law was like in the Depression era. And those who were curious about human existence. A fabulous 10 star Classic.

    In taking a good look at the movies that made American cinema in one way or the other, "Bonnie And Clyde" glitters in its own way. It's one of the very first films that started the New Hollywood movement, one of the most dense periods in the history of film. Based on the real story of Bonnie and Clyde, two bank robbers active in 1930's Texas, the film stars Warren Beatty (who also produces) and Faye Dunaway, in her first major role. Clyde has just been released in prison when he meets Bonnie by chance. Immediately fascinated by the exciting lifestyle Clyde has to endure, she flees with him, and together they run all over the American South robbing banks. Along with them they soon pick up a timid mechanic to help them, and Clyde's brother Buck meets them and joins them along with his wife. The five of them are now famed by the press and are being hunted all over, so it becomes harder and harder for the bunch to find peace for even one night. Beatty and Dunaway's duet is almost iconic now: together, Bonnie and Clyde symbolize the "gangster couple" that many films have been inspired by years later. Although the honor of best actor in the film would have to go to Gene Hackman playing Buck, the couple steals the screen and wins the favor of the audience from the get-go. But the movie has been influential also for its visual style, a credit to be attributed to director Arthur Penn, who was on his fifth film. Violence here was considered graphic and especially crude at the time, and as a consequence it initiated the trend of highlighting violence during the New Hollywood years, a trend that still today is extremely popular and is even more highlighted and crude. Sex plays another controversial factor, not really for its depiction ( there's not much to see), but for the fact that Clyde seems almost asexual and not willing to engage in a romance with Bonnie. Of course, this is not one of the most popular kind of relationships seen on the big screen. "Bonnie And Clyde" has aged perfectly well, and although it's not a movie with much replay value in this reviewer's eyes, it still ought to hold the important position it currently holds in movie history. It's to say the least that it's been an influential picture for many, and represents the beginning of an essential chapter of American pop culture.

    Bonnie and Clyde being about a fate-formed couple who originated as complete and total opposites and end up becoming the states' outlaws making their way into fugitives, is a very intelligent way to be remembered. This film is the reference film to so many things known today and seeing this film, now I know why. They were in love. And yet again, the message "You Can't Help Who You Love" is in this film as well as other films recently watched. The film was so well-made and beautifully put together that this movie is legendary. To bad the younger youth of today's society won't have a great understanding of what this film really and truly meant.

    I love this movie! I can honestly watch it over and over again. This film has great photography and great dialog. The costumes really allow the audience's imagination to flow towards the time period being portrayed. The film gives an adrenaline rush that is so natural; it takes you back a bit. I feel as though many people like this film because it is not realistic, it is sort of fantasy.However, the costumes and the simplistic nature of the film itself allows for audiences to forget that it is indeed fantasy. sooner before later, you are caught on the ride. You forget about the realism and your mind is stimulated off of the thoughts of something like this actually happening. The fact that love is thrown in the mix creates for an immediate attention grabber.

    I really enjoyed watching this film! I thought it was paced perfectly and the complexity of the characters and the story kept me interested the whole way through. The fact that this film was made a couple of years after the actual events had happened made it that much cooler to watch. I had previously researched the real Bonnie & Clyde, so I thought the film was a neat adaptation of the events. The actors in this film are what really made it as great as it was. Beatty and Faye have great chemistry in this film and I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Also, their redheaded sidekick was a wonderful addition that helped add a but of personality to the film. The sound in this movie was great. There were many gunshots and dialogue that often overlapped one another, but I thought that it went along with the film really well.

    Bonnie and Clyde is a very classic film which follows the story of the two ruthless bankrobbers.That actually terrorized the u.s. a couple decades before the movie came out. I Like how the movie is based off of factual people it gives it more of a sense of realism.Both actors do a great job at portraying the hardnose criminals as well as showing there love for each other and that they were willing to go against the world. The movie editing was done well as well as the scenes. The lighting in this film is very good to.both actors seemed to fit into their role perfectly it was a very enjoyable film to watch. I would recommended it to any crime drama movie lover.

    This movie is a bit surreal. It is so interesting how crime in portrayed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are watching it. The cinematography is stunning in this movie as well. The scenes were all done really well. It is very interesting to see how this film portrays real life. It can be realistic at parts, and unrealistic at other parts. The acting was superb in this film, and it made the movie that much better. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes crime, drama, suspense, and action. Its a perfect mix of all of those things. Add in the good plot, the good acting, and good cinematography, and this is a really good film. A must watch for all.

    This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.

    Bonnie Parker(played by Faye Dunaway) & Clyde Barrow(played by Warren Beatty) are a depression era couple who commit a brazen series of bank robberies across the Midwest. They are eventually joined by Clyde's brother Buck(played by Gene Hackman) his wife Blanche(Estelle Parsons) and a gas station attendant named C. W. Moss(Michael J. Pollard). All are on a collision course with a violent end as the manhunt(led by Denver Pyle) closes in on them... Popular and trend-setting film is ultimately all style over substance; well-acted by stars playing unlikable people who deserve what they get. Film seems to be as along for the ride as the supporting characters, rather than portraying their dead-end and violent crime spree as something to be condemned. Imagine the film told from the POV of the authorities to see what I mean...

    Bonnie and Clyde (1967) Bonnie and Clyde the people are now legends and the movie is just as legendary and respectable, unlike the people. Written with a lot of meat to its bones: emotionally, entertainingly, and intellectually, Bonnie and Clyde is a dazzling movie. There is something about the directing here that latches onto the viewer, bites them like a mosquito and then suddenly it consumes them. This movie is the mark of something special. It's a finely well- rounded in the way that it communicates to the audience and what its saying. Like the mosquito bite analogy, it sticks around for a while and stirs in your mind. Technically aside, it's a blast to watch, too. The title characters are one heck of a movie couple and are entertaining people to spend time with. Both lead performances contribute to the film's staggering success, and for me Warren Beatty delivers a volcanic smash of a portrayal and is one of the best things about the movie. As the writing, action, and romance, technically it was ahead of its time, thankfully, which make the many action scenes stand and significant. Bonnie and Clyde is a captivating film that stands as one of the defining movies that advanced the industry and the genre of action movies. Rating: 9.5/10 Grade: A

The fact that this film was made a couple of years after the actual events had happened made it that much cooler to watch. I had previously researched the real Bonnie & Clyde, so I thought the film was a neat adaptation of the events. The actors in this film are what really made it as great as it was. Beatty and Faye have great chemistry in this film and I enjoyed watching them interact on screen. Also, their redheaded sidekick was a wonderful addition that helped add a but of personality to the film. The sound in this movie was great. There were many gunshots and dialogue that often overlapped one another, but I thought that it went along with the film really well.

    Bonnie and Clyde is a very classic film which follows the story of the two ruthless bankrobbers.That actually terrorized the u.s. a couple decades before the movie came out. I Like how the movie is based off of factual people it gives it more of a sense of realism.Both actors do a great job at portraying the hardnose criminals as well as showing there love for each other and that they were willing to go against the world. The movie editing was done well as well as the scenes. The lighting in this film is very good to.both actors seemed to fit into their role perfectly it was a very enjoyable film to watch. I would recommended it to any crime drama movie lover.

    This movie is a bit surreal. It is so interesting how crime in portrayed. This movie will have you on the edge of your seat the entire time you are watching it. The cinematography is stunning in this movie as well. The scenes were all done really well. It is very interesting to see how this film portrays real life. It can be realistic at parts, and unrealistic at other parts. The acting was superb in this film, and it made the movie that much better. This movie is a must see for anyone who likes crime, drama, suspense, and action. Its a perfect mix of all of those things. Add in the good plot, the good acting, and good cinematography, and this is a really good film. A must watch for all.

    This movie was important in that it twisted all of the social norms that cinema had showcased up until now. It was, of course, made during the very end of the Hayes code and the beginning of the American cultural revolution. The same year of The Graduate. The violence was excessive and gave the American people something that they didn't know they had been craving. Ever since, violent movies have been a stronghold and directors who focus on violence have been well-received. It's a bold statement, but this film may be one of the (if not the one) catalyst to America's love for violence. It took on a different perception of crime as had been portrayed in movies past. The audience finds itself rooting for Bonnie and Clyde to get away. Their life of crime is shown in such a lighthearted way that it seems almost attractive. I enjoyed this film very much.
