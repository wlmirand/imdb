 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  On Christmas Eve, an old miser named Ebenezer Scrooge is visited by the spirit of his former partner, Jacob Marley. The deceased partner was in his lifetime as mean and miserly as Scrooge is now and he warns him to change his ways or face the consequences in the afterlife. Scrooge dismisses the apparition but the first of the three ghosts, the Ghost of Christmas Past, visits as promised. Scrooge sees those events in his past life, both happy and sad, that forged his character. The second spirit, the Ghost of Christmas Present, shows him how many currently celebrate Christmas. The Ghost of Christmas yet to Come shows him how he will be remembered once he is gone. To his delight, the spirits complete their visits in one night giving him the opportunity to mend his ways.

    Not the best version of A Christmas Carol(one of Charles Dickens' most famous, best and most accessible stories)- the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions, the 1994 Jetlag and 2001 animated films are the only versions below average- and is not perfect. The Ghost of Christmas Past section is too brief and should have been much more- more time, more detail-, the reason why Scrooge seems to have repented too soon in this version, and Terry Kilburn's Tiny Tim is too healthy and overwrought, the character should have a lot of pathos but Kilburn seems to be trying too hard. There is still a lot to like though. The Ghost of Christmas Present section is very heart-warming, definitely of the Three Ghosts sections the one with the most heart, and the one of Christmas-Yet-to-Come will have youngsters diving under the covers, the people in the section observing and commenting on the situation are quite realistically drawn. While not lavish or big in budget, the film still has splendid period detail and shot in lovely black and white. The special effects are not too shabby, though not award-worthy. The whimsical music score, mean-meaning script, heartfelt message that gets its point across and the ceaselessly entertaining and poignant storytelling are other selling points. And the acting is fine on the most part. Reginald Owen does make a great account of himself as Scrooge(if not quite embodying the character like Sim did), while Leo G. Caroll is very spooky if soft-spoken Jacob Marley and Barry MacKay is possibly the best and most likable Fred on screen. Lionel Brahurn's Ghost of Christmas Present is wonderfully jovial, Ann Rutherford is utterly beguiling though deserving of more screen time and Gene Lockhart appeals in how humble he is. Overall, warm, charming and entertaining though not definitive. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    A Christmas Carol is directed by Edwin L. Marin and adapted to screenplay by Hugo Butler from the Charles Dickens story of the same name. It stars Reginald Owen, Gene Lockhart, Kathleen Lockhart, Terry Kilburn and Barry MacKay. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Sidney Wagner and John F. Seitz. I wonder just how many times A Christmas Carol has been adapted to theatre, film, television, radio or opera? Well it's a lot as we know, but my point being that it's one of those literary works that needs no introduction or plot synopsis. It's as famous as famous can be. With all the many "film" adaptations to view, there's often discussions about which is the best, which is the most loyal to the source and etc etc, what mostly comes through in such discussions is that it's such a brilliant piece of literary work it would take the work of an idiot to mess up the feel good factor come the story's denouement. Thankfully, in spite of tampering with aspects of the source material, Marin's 38 version is as pleasing as a glass of Xmas punch. There are minor irritants here no doubt about it, Scrooge begins to turn from mean miser to good fellow a bit too early, and traditionalists do balk at the changes in the story such as a sex change for one of the ghosts, Cratchit gets the sack, the haunting grimness is missing with the ghost visitations and again etc etc, yet the essence is right and the key points are rightfully included. Given it's a film that runs just under 70 minutes some scenes are rushed, but it's very well performed by the cast (Owen wonderfully caustic as Scrooge after stepping in when Lionel Barrymore's ill health ruled him out of the production) and the joy that comes with the finale is simply impossible to ignore. Like a lot of other people I'm a lover of the Alastair Sim 1951 version, of which this MGM version is often unfairly compared against. For although the 51 film is definitive in its adaptation, and rightfully sits at the top of many people's lists of filmic productions, Marin's film has much to recommend it to being part of your perennial Xmas viewing schedules. 8/10

    a special adaptation. Christmas spirit . and more. a good cast. and lovely atmosphere. sure, an antique. but very wise, touching and precise. the old fashion shining is not only virtue. it remains basis of an admirable work. sentimental and good medicine for soul, it is, in same time, a real Dickens. no tricks, no innovation. only lines of a classical story about conquest of a holiday. so, a honest movie. or little more because Reginald Owen does a memorable Scrooge. bitter, warm, seductive. fresh, fragile. perfect character without strange shadows. memory of respectable dear Charles Dickens is present in each performance. and the fragile map of this carol is more important by many other adaptations.

    There's plenty of adaptations of A Christmas Carol out there and it's likely that, if you're going to delve into Christmas past, you may get no further than the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim. However, this one from 13 years earlier is also worthy of a look, even if it does take a few liberties with the story. I'm of the opinion that there's little point deviating too much from the source, as A Christmas Carol might just be the greatest spec script in English literature. Perfectly paced and with endless quotable dialogue, it really shouldn't be too hard to get a serviceable movie out of an adaptation. Perhaps that's why my biggest problems with this version are when it deviates from the source; such as Scrooge sacking Cratchett on Christmas Eve (making Bob Cratchett's toast to him the following day utterly bizarre), or the fact that Tiny Tim seems remarkably healthy for someone who has few Christmasses in their future. The largest oversight is the absence of Scrooge's lost-love Belle from the story, perhaps because it's the biggest indication of just why the old man is so bitter and miserly. Curiously, despite omitting this character, there's a bigger role for Fred's partner (his fianc&eacute;e in this, rather than his wife). Why the film decides to focus on this couple without counter-balancing it with Scrooge's own sad love-story is a bit of a mystery. Aside from that, it's really not too bad. It tells the story well and doesn't look nearly as old as it actually is. But in a world of countless versions of this story, it is a little forgettable - neither bad enough to stick in the mind, nor interesting enough to join the ranks of Sim, Scott and the Muppets.

    In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the bitter, greedy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen) hates Christmas and people. He runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart) and spends unfriendly treatment to his nephew Fred (Barry MacKay) and acquaintances. In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed chained ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carroll), who died seven years ago and tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his happy childhood and coming of age; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and the happiness of Fred and his fianc&eacute;e Bessy; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general. "A Christmas Carol" is one of the most beautiful Christmas tales in the cinema. I do not recall how many adaptations of one of the most known Charles Dickens' short story I have seen but this 1938 is also wonderful. I do not have much more to say but recommend this magnificent family entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Um Conto de Natal" ("A Christmas Tale")

    WOW, My first ever movie from the 30's , I never thought I would ever see a movie from 30s This movie version felt bit more different then 1951, I felt there were more fun parts in this movie and very good feel to the movie, while you are you feeling kinda of happy and cheerfully As-well As I only seem 1951 version first time few weeks ago, in still in my head, I was comparing both parts. I found scrooge it bit more nasty at the start of the movie, as movies goes, I don't feel think it was as good guy who played Scooge in 1951 version. Near the end of the movie, I think it was going little over the top, it went a bit too Jolly. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10, not as good as 1951. Might be seeing 1935 version later,

    In the 1970's KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angles would play this film on Christmas Eve at 11:00pm. My parents would be mad because my two sisters and I would be watching this in oldest My sister's room. It was a tradition that we did for years (Keeping my parents up well past Midnight on Christmas Eve I am sure was very hard on them). This version was my introduction to the story of Mr Scrooge and II will forever hold dear in my heart because it is a favorite Christmas Memory! Its not the gifts that I got it was just watching and enjoying this film with my sisters. Now there have been better adaption however this version is very well made and there is something about this Old B/W movie that will always bring a smile in my heart. To me its not Christmas unless I get a chance to watch this version. I hope one day my sisters and I can watch this again together on Christmas Eve. To me that would be a perfect Christmas gift.

    It occurred to me while watching this film the other day that back when I was a kid, I probably saw this and the Alistair Sim version interchangeably without realizing they were two different pictures. While I prefer the later British film as an adult, I can agree that this 'warmer' treatment of the holiday classic is just as watchable and enjoyable to get into the Christmas spirit. The other thing I didn't realize was that Gene Lockhart, portraying Bob Cratchit, played opposite his real life wife Kathleen in the Mrs. Cratchit role. Rounding out the family connection is daughter June Lockhart appearing in an uncredited part as one of the Cratchit children. Great stuff you pick up on Turner Classics. No one needs to be reminded of the story, so I'll pass on that. Interestingly, Reginald Owen's performance of the miserly Scrooge would wind up being his only lead role in a picture. And to think it would be the result of an injury to Lionel Barrymore, originally cast for the part until he sustained an injury on another film set. Funny how things work out in a way where another actor in a role might have changed forever one's perception of a film. I like to watch 'A Christmas Carol' every Christmas Eve, and though I can't arrange for a light snowfall every year, when it occurs that's always a nice bonus. This year I'll pop in the Alistair Sim picture once again; the challenge being that for the first time, I've talked myself into checking out the colorized version.

    Lavish MGM sets are the highlight of this version of Ebenezer Scrooge, with a haughty, abrasive performance as the miser by Reginald Owen. As mentioned by multiple other reviews, this version is heavily truncated. While I do love David Warner as the character in 1984's version with George C Scott as the miser, my all time favorite is Gene Lockhart who is just delightful as Bob Cratchet, a fine fellow often assaulted by Scrooge's stubborn, greedy ways. Lockhart is particularly amusing the way he quivers in fear when Scrooge enters the room, demanding less coal and more work. Interesting enough Owen hunches over and walks almost insect like, a scowl and sneer for anyone who offers Christmas cheer. In this version Scrooge fires Cratchet for hitting him accidentally with a snowball, knocking his top hat into the street to be run over by a horse carriage. In this version Scrooge actually calls neighborhood watch into his room to rid himself of "intruder" Jacob Marley. In this version the Ghost of Christmas Past is a beautiful woman. While this version does have his sister visiting him at school, we do not see Scrooge meeting with his cold hearted father. And we never see Scrooge's relationship with his girlfriend and the deterioration of it due to greed which tore them apart. Nor do we see Scrooge's betrayal of Fezziwig(Fezzi makes a brief appearance informing Scrooge he must attend his holiday party)or the visit to his dying sister's bedside. Regarding the Ghost of Christmas Present, he isn't a towering figure as we are accustomed to seeing, but we do spend a great deal of time with Cratchet's family(actually, interesting enough, this film has more time for the family than with Scrooge's many failings as a person). There's an emphasis on playing in the snowy streets. Scrooge visits the city church where we see Bob and Tiny Tim, nephew Fred and his fianc&eacute;, singing "O Come All Ye Faithful". Scrooge looks on spellbound from the window with Ghost Present as Fred and company discuss Ebenezer and Blindman's Bluff. Ghost Present even uses his horn to sprinkle "christmas cheer" on those who need it. The love in Cratchet's family rings true(Gene would star with real life wife Katherine and daughter June)and feels genuine which tugs on our heartstrings when Tim later is established to have died when Scrooge visits their more solemn home with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(which while appearing in Grim Reaper garb is less frightening than in other versions). Regarding the Future Scrooge visits his death bed and tombstone, not to mention, he listens as businessmen discuss his demise with lack of any remorse whatsoever. A Christmas CAROL is over in a flash and doesn't cover as much ground as other versions, but Reginald Owen's only star vehicle does provide some nice moments, including his besieging the Cratchets(Bob's surprise at the sight of a Scrooge bearing gifts is golden)with a goose and presents; as well as, his visit to Fred and his fianc&eacute;, promising to make the young man partner.

    Christmas Carol, A (1938) *** (out of 4) Nice adaptation of Charles Dickens short story has character actor Reginald Owen playing the role of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge. Everyone should know the story but Scrooge is warned by his old partner Marley (Leo G. Carroll) that he's going to be visited by three ghosts and his fate depends on what he learns. I've seen quite a few versions of this famous story and I must admit that I think all of them are charming in their own right and most of the credit must go to Dickens himself for writing such an amazing story that we all know so well that sometimes it's hard to believe someone could come up with such a clever story and message. I wouldn't say this is my favorite versions of the story, that would probably be the one with George C. Scott, but there's still plenty to enjoy here. What works best is that the film really doesn't add any filler as the thing runs a brief 68-minutes so it's pretty much to the point from start to finish. We briefly get to know the characters and then we're off to the races as the filmmakers are certainly expecting the viewer to know what's going on and who's who. Owen was excellent at playing the "happy" Scrooge but I felt he wasn't nearly mean enough in the darker role. I certainly enjoyed his performance here but it seems like he was either held back from being too dark or he simply didn't go a bit further with the role. On the other hand, he's flawless as the happy Scrooge and really makes that part of the character his very own and is quite memorable in the final moments of the film. Gene Lockhart turns in a very good performance as Cratchit and Barry MacKay is also very good as Scrooge's nephew. Lionel Braham, Ann Rutherford and D'Arcy Corrigan are good as the three spirits and the rest of the supporting cast are also fine in their roles.

Its not the gifts that I got it was just watching and enjoying this film with my sisters. Now there have been better adaption however this version is very well made and there is something about this Old B/W movie that will always bring a smile in my heart. To me its not Christmas unless I get a chance to watch this version. I hope one day my sisters and I can watch this again together on Christmas Eve. To me that would be a perfect Christmas gift.

    It occurred to me while watching this film the other day that back when I was a kid, I probably saw this and the Alistair Sim version interchangeably without realizing they were two different pictures. While I prefer the later British film as an adult, I can agree that this 'warmer' treatment of the holiday classic is just as watchable and enjoyable to get into the Christmas spirit. The other thing I didn't realize was that Gene Lockhart, portraying Bob Cratchit, played opposite his real life wife Kathleen in the Mrs. Cratchit role. Rounding out the family connection is daughter June Lockhart appearing in an uncredited part as one of the Cratchit children. Great stuff you pick up on Turner Classics. No one needs to be reminded of the story, so I'll pass on that. Interestingly, Reginald Owen's performance of the miserly Scrooge would wind up being his only lead role in a picture. And to think it would be the result of an injury to Lionel Barrymore, originally cast for the part until he sustained an injury on another film set. Funny how things work out in a way where another actor in a role might have changed forever one's perception of a film. I like to watch 'A Christmas Carol' every Christmas Eve, and though I can't arrange for a light snowfall every year, when it occurs that's always a nice bonus. This year I'll pop in the Alistair Sim picture once again; the challenge being that for the first time, I've talked myself into checking out the colorized version.

    Lavish MGM sets are the highlight of this version of Ebenezer Scrooge, with a haughty, abrasive performance as the miser by Reginald Owen. As mentioned by multiple other reviews, this version is heavily truncated. While I do love David Warner as the character in 1984's version with George C Scott as the miser, my all time favorite is Gene Lockhart who is just delightful as Bob Cratchet, a fine fellow often assaulted by Scrooge's stubborn, greedy ways. Lockhart is particularly amusing the way he quivers in fear when Scrooge enters the room, demanding less coal and more work. Interesting enough Owen hunches over and walks almost insect like, a scowl and sneer for anyone who offers Christmas cheer. In this version Scrooge fires Cratchet for hitting him accidentally with a snowball, knocking his top hat into the street to be run over by a horse carriage. In this version Scrooge actually calls neighborhood watch into his room to rid himself of "intruder" Jacob Marley. In this version the Ghost of Christmas Past is a beautiful woman. While this version does have his sister visiting him at school, we do not see Scrooge meeting with his cold hearted father. And we never see Scrooge's relationship with his girlfriend and the deterioration of it due to greed which tore them apart. Nor do we see Scrooge's betrayal of Fezziwig(Fezzi makes a brief appearance informing Scrooge he must attend his holiday party)or the visit to his dying sister's bedside. Regarding the Ghost of Christmas Present, he isn't a towering figure as we are accustomed to seeing, but we do spend a great deal of time with Cratchet's family(actually, interesting enough, this film has more time for the family than with Scrooge's many failings as a person). There's an emphasis on playing in the snowy streets. Scrooge visits the city church where we see Bob and Tiny Tim, nephew Fred and his fianc&eacute;, singing "O Come All Ye Faithful". Scrooge looks on spellbound from the window with Ghost Present as Fred and company discuss Ebenezer and Blindman's Bluff. Ghost Present even uses his horn to sprinkle "christmas cheer" on those who need it. The love in Cratchet's family rings true(Gene would star with real life wife Katherine and daughter June)and feels genuine which tugs on our heartstrings when Tim later is established to have died when Scrooge visits their more solemn home with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(which while appearing in Grim Reaper garb is less frightening than in other versions). Regarding the Future Scrooge visits his death bed and tombstone, not to mention, he listens as businessmen discuss his demise with lack of any remorse whatsoever. A Christmas CAROL is over in a flash and doesn't cover as much ground as other versions, but Reginald Owen's only star vehicle does provide some nice moments, including his besieging the Cratchets(Bob's surprise at the sight of a Scrooge bearing gifts is golden)with a goose and presents; as well as, his visit to Fred and his fianc&eacute;, promising to make the young man partner.

    Christmas Carol, A (1938) *** (out of 4) Nice adaptation of Charles Dickens short story has character actor Reginald Owen playing the role of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge. Everyone should know the story but Scrooge is warned by his old partner Marley (Leo G. Carroll) that he's going to be visited by three ghosts and his fate depends on what he learns. I've seen quite a few versions of this famous story and I must admit that I think all of them are charming in their own right and most of the credit must go to Dickens himself for writing such an amazing story that we all know so well that sometimes it's hard to believe someone could come up with such a clever story and message. I wouldn't say this is my favorite versions of the story, that would probably be the one with George C. Scott, but there's still plenty to enjoy here. What works best is that the film really doesn't add any filler as the thing runs a brief 68-minutes so it's pretty much to the point from start to finish. We briefly get to know the characters and then we're off to the races as the filmmakers are certainly expecting the viewer to know what's going on and who's who. Owen was excellent at playing the "happy" Scrooge but I felt he wasn't nearly mean enough in the darker role. I certainly enjoyed his performance here but it seems like he was either held back from being too dark or he simply didn't go a bit further with the role. On the other hand, he's flawless as the happy Scrooge and really makes that part of the character his very own and is quite memorable in the final moments of the film. Gene Lockhart turns in a very good performance as Cratchit and Barry MacKay is also very good as Scrooge's nephew. Lionel Braham, Ann Rutherford and D'Arcy Corrigan are good as the three spirits and the rest of the supporting cast are also fine in their roles.

    Not the best version of A Christmas Carol(one of Charles Dickens' most famous, best and most accessible stories)- the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions, the 1994 Jetlag and 2001 animated films are the only versions below average- and is not perfect. The Ghost of Christmas Past section is too brief and should have been much more- more time, more detail-, the reason why Scrooge seems to have repented too soon in this version, and Terry Kilburn's Tiny Tim is too healthy and overwrought, the character should have a lot of pathos but Kilburn seems to be trying too hard. There is still a lot to like though. The Ghost of Christmas Present section is very heart-warming, definitely of the Three Ghosts sections the one with the most heart, and the one of Christmas-Yet-to-Come will have youngsters diving under the covers, the people in the section observing and commenting on the situation are quite realistically drawn. While not lavish or big in budget, the film still has splendid period detail and shot in lovely black and white. The special effects are not too shabby, though not award-worthy. The whimsical music score, mean-meaning script, heartfelt message that gets its point across and the ceaselessly entertaining and poignant storytelling are other selling points. And the acting is fine on the most part. Reginald Owen does make a great account of himself as Scrooge(if not quite embodying the character like Sim did), while Leo G. Caroll is very spooky if soft-spoken Jacob Marley and Barry MacKay is possibly the best and most likable Fred on screen. Lionel Brahurn's Ghost of Christmas Present is wonderfully jovial, Ann Rutherford is utterly beguiling though deserving of more screen time and Gene Lockhart appeals in how humble he is. Overall, warm, charming and entertaining though not definitive. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    A Christmas Carol is directed by Edwin L. Marin and adapted to screenplay by Hugo Butler from the Charles Dickens story of the same name. It stars Reginald Owen, Gene Lockhart, Kathleen Lockhart, Terry Kilburn and Barry MacKay. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Sidney Wagner and John F. Seitz. I wonder just how many times A Christmas Carol has been adapted to theatre, film, television, radio or opera? Well it's a lot as we know, but my point being that it's one of those literary works that needs no introduction or plot synopsis. It's as famous as famous can be. With all the many "film" adaptations to view, there's often discussions about which is the best, which is the most loyal to the source and etc etc, what mostly comes through in such discussions is that it's such a brilliant piece of literary work it would take the work of an idiot to mess up the feel good factor come the story's denouement. Thankfully, in spite of tampering with aspects of the source material, Marin's 38 version is as pleasing as a glass of Xmas punch. There are minor irritants here no doubt about it, Scrooge begins to turn from mean miser to good fellow a bit too early, and traditionalists do balk at the changes in the story such as a sex change for one of the ghosts, Cratchit gets the sack, the haunting grimness is missing with the ghost visitations and again etc etc, yet the essence is right and the key points are rightfully included. Given it's a film that runs just under 70 minutes some scenes are rushed, but it's very well performed by the cast (Owen wonderfully caustic as Scrooge after stepping in when Lionel Barrymore's ill health ruled him out of the production) and the joy that comes with the finale is simply impossible to ignore. Like a lot of other people I'm a lover of the Alastair Sim 1951 version, of which this MGM version is often unfairly compared against. For although the 51 film is definitive in its adaptation, and rightfully sits at the top of many people's lists of filmic productions, Marin's film has much to recommend it to being part of your perennial Xmas viewing schedules. 8/10

    a special adaptation. Christmas spirit . and more. a good cast. and lovely atmosphere. sure, an antique. but very wise, touching and precise. the old fashion shining is not only virtue. it remains basis of an admirable work. sentimental and good medicine for soul, it is, in same time, a real Dickens. no tricks, no innovation. only lines of a classical story about conquest of a holiday. so, a honest movie. or little more because Reginald Owen does a memorable Scrooge. bitter, warm, seductive. fresh, fragile. perfect character without strange shadows. memory of respectable dear Charles Dickens is present in each performance. and the fragile map of this carol is more important by many other adaptations.

    There's plenty of adaptations of A Christmas Carol out there and it's likely that, if you're going to delve into Christmas past, you may get no further than the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim. However, this one from 13 years earlier is also worthy of a look, even if it does take a few liberties with the story. I'm of the opinion that there's little point deviating too much from the source, as A Christmas Carol might just be the greatest spec script in English literature. Perfectly paced and with endless quotable dialogue, it really shouldn't be too hard to get a serviceable movie out of an adaptation. Perhaps that's why my biggest problems with this version are when it deviates from the source; such as Scrooge sacking Cratchett on Christmas Eve (making Bob Cratchett's toast to him the following day utterly bizarre), or the fact that Tiny Tim seems remarkably healthy for someone who has few Christmasses in their future. The largest oversight is the absence of Scrooge's lost-love Belle from the story, perhaps because it's the biggest indication of just why the old man is so bitter and miserly. Curiously, despite omitting this character, there's a bigger role for Fred's partner (his fianc&eacute;e in this, rather than his wife). Why the film decides to focus on this couple without counter-balancing it with Scrooge's own sad love-story is a bit of a mystery. Aside from that, it's really not too bad. It tells the story well and doesn't look nearly as old as it actually is. But in a world of countless versions of this story, it is a little forgettable - neither bad enough to stick in the mind, nor interesting enough to join the ranks of Sim, Scott and the Muppets.

    In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the bitter, greedy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen) hates Christmas and people. He runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart) and spends unfriendly treatment to his nephew Fred (Barry MacKay) and acquaintances. In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed chained ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carroll), who died seven years ago and tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his happy childhood and coming of age; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and the happiness of Fred and his fianc&eacute;e Bessy; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general. "A Christmas Carol" is one of the most beautiful Christmas tales in the cinema. I do not recall how many adaptations of one of the most known Charles Dickens' short story I have seen but this 1938 is also wonderful. I do not have much more to say but recommend this magnificent family entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Um Conto de Natal" ("A Christmas Tale")

    WOW, My first ever movie from the 30's , I never thought I would ever see a movie from 30s This movie version felt bit more different then 1951, I felt there were more fun parts in this movie and very good feel to the movie, while you are you feeling kinda of happy and cheerfully As-well As I only seem 1951 version first time few weeks ago, in still in my head, I was comparing both parts. I found scrooge it bit more nasty at the start of the movie, as movies goes, I don't feel think it was as good guy who played Scooge in 1951 version. Near the end of the movie, I think it was going little over the top, it went a bit too Jolly. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10, not as good as 1951. Might be seeing 1935 version later,

It was a tradition that we did for years (Keeping my parents up well past Midnight on Christmas Eve I am sure was very hard on them). This version was my introduction to the story of Mr Scrooge and II will forever hold dear in my heart because it is a favorite Christmas Memory!

I'm of the opinion that there's little point deviating too much from the source, as A Christmas Carol might just be the greatest spec script in English literature. Perfectly paced and with endless quotable dialogue, it really shouldn't be too hard to get a serviceable movie out of an adaptation. Perhaps that's why my biggest problems with this version are when it deviates from the source; such as Scrooge sacking Cratchett on Christmas Eve (making Bob Cratchett's toast to him the following day utterly bizarre), or the fact that Tiny Tim seems remarkably healthy for someone who has few Christmasses in their future. The largest oversight is the absence of Scrooge's lost-love Belle from the story, perhaps because it's the biggest indication of just why the old man is so bitter and miserly. Curiously, despite omitting this character, there's a bigger role for Fred's partner (his fianc&eacute;e in this, rather than his wife). Why the film decides to focus on this couple without counter-balancing it with Scrooge's own sad love-story is a bit of a mystery. Aside from that, it's really not too bad. It tells the story well and doesn't look nearly as old as it actually is. But in a world of countless versions of this story, it is a little forgettable - neither bad enough to stick in the mind, nor interesting enough to join the ranks of Sim, Scott and the Muppets.

    In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the bitter, greedy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen) hates Christmas and people. He runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart) and spends unfriendly treatment to his nephew Fred (Barry MacKay) and acquaintances. In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed chained ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carroll), who died seven years ago and tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his happy childhood and coming of age; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and the happiness of Fred and his fianc&eacute;e Bessy; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general. "A Christmas Carol" is one of the most beautiful Christmas tales in the cinema. I do not recall how many adaptations of one of the most known Charles Dickens' short story I have seen but this 1938 is also wonderful. I do not have much more to say but recommend this magnificent family entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Um Conto de Natal" ("A Christmas Tale")

    WOW, My first ever movie from the 30's , I never thought I would ever see a movie from 30s This movie version felt bit more different then 1951, I felt there were more fun parts in this movie and very good feel to the movie, while you are you feeling kinda of happy and cheerfully As-well As I only seem 1951 version first time few weeks ago, in still in my head, I was comparing both parts. I found scrooge it bit more nasty at the start of the movie, as movies goes, I don't feel think it was as good guy who played Scooge in 1951 version. Near the end of the movie, I think it was going little over the top, it went a bit too Jolly. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10, not as good as 1951. Might be seeing 1935 version later,

    In the 1970's KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angles would play this film on Christmas Eve at 11:00pm. My parents would be mad because my two sisters and I would be watching this in oldest My sister's room. It was a tradition that we did for years (Keeping my parents up well past Midnight on Christmas Eve I am sure was very hard on them). This version was my introduction to the story of Mr Scrooge and II will forever hold dear in my heart because it is a favorite Christmas Memory! Its not the gifts that I got it was just watching and enjoying this film with my sisters. Now there have been better adaption however this version is very well made and there is something about this Old B/W movie that will always bring a smile in my heart. To me its not Christmas unless I get a chance to watch this version. I hope one day my sisters and I can watch this again together on Christmas Eve. To me that would be a perfect Christmas gift.

    It occurred to me while watching this film the other day that back when I was a kid, I probably saw this and the Alistair Sim version interchangeably without realizing they were two different pictures. While I prefer the later British film as an adult, I can agree that this 'warmer' treatment of the holiday classic is just as watchable and enjoyable to get into the Christmas spirit. The other thing I didn't realize was that Gene Lockhart, portraying Bob Cratchit, played opposite his real life wife Kathleen in the Mrs. Cratchit role. Rounding out the family connection is daughter June Lockhart appearing in an uncredited part as one of the Cratchit children. Great stuff you pick up on Turner Classics. No one needs to be reminded of the story, so I'll pass on that. Interestingly, Reginald Owen's performance of the miserly Scrooge would wind up being his only lead role in a picture. And to think it would be the result of an injury to Lionel Barrymore, originally cast for the part until he sustained an injury on another film set. Funny how things work out in a way where another actor in a role might have changed forever one's perception of a film. I like to watch 'A Christmas Carol' every Christmas Eve, and though I can't arrange for a light snowfall every year, when it occurs that's always a nice bonus. This year I'll pop in the Alistair Sim picture once again; the challenge being that for the first time, I've talked myself into checking out the colorized version.

    Lavish MGM sets are the highlight of this version of Ebenezer Scrooge, with a haughty, abrasive performance as the miser by Reginald Owen. As mentioned by multiple other reviews, this version is heavily truncated. While I do love David Warner as the character in 1984's version with George C Scott as the miser, my all time favorite is Gene Lockhart who is just delightful as Bob Cratchet, a fine fellow often assaulted by Scrooge's stubborn, greedy ways. Lockhart is particularly amusing the way he quivers in fear when Scrooge enters the room, demanding less coal and more work. Interesting enough Owen hunches over and walks almost insect like, a scowl and sneer for anyone who offers Christmas cheer. In this version Scrooge fires Cratchet for hitting him accidentally with a snowball, knocking his top hat into the street to be run over by a horse carriage. In this version Scrooge actually calls neighborhood watch into his room to rid himself of "intruder" Jacob Marley. In this version the Ghost of Christmas Past is a beautiful woman. While this version does have his sister visiting him at school, we do not see Scrooge meeting with his cold hearted father. And we never see Scrooge's relationship with his girlfriend and the deterioration of it due to greed which tore them apart. Nor do we see Scrooge's betrayal of Fezziwig(Fezzi makes a brief appearance informing Scrooge he must attend his holiday party)or the visit to his dying sister's bedside. Regarding the Ghost of Christmas Present, he isn't a towering figure as we are accustomed to seeing, but we do spend a great deal of time with Cratchet's family(actually, interesting enough, this film has more time for the family than with Scrooge's many failings as a person). There's an emphasis on playing in the snowy streets. Scrooge visits the city church where we see Bob and Tiny Tim, nephew Fred and his fianc&eacute;, singing "O Come All Ye Faithful". Scrooge looks on spellbound from the window with Ghost Present as Fred and company discuss Ebenezer and Blindman's Bluff. Ghost Present even uses his horn to sprinkle "christmas cheer" on those who need it. The love in Cratchet's family rings true(Gene would star with real life wife Katherine and daughter June)and feels genuine which tugs on our heartstrings when Tim later is established to have died when Scrooge visits their more solemn home with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(which while appearing in Grim Reaper garb is less frightening than in other versions). Regarding the Future Scrooge visits his death bed and tombstone, not to mention, he listens as businessmen discuss his demise with lack of any remorse whatsoever. A Christmas CAROL is over in a flash and doesn't cover as much ground as other versions, but Reginald Owen's only star vehicle does provide some nice moments, including his besieging the Cratchets(Bob's surprise at the sight of a Scrooge bearing gifts is golden)with a goose and presents; as well as, his visit to Fred and his fianc&eacute;, promising to make the young man partner.

    Christmas Carol, A (1938) *** (out of 4) Nice adaptation of Charles Dickens short story has character actor Reginald Owen playing the role of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge. Everyone should know the story but Scrooge is warned by his old partner Marley (Leo G. Carroll) that he's going to be visited by three ghosts and his fate depends on what he learns. I've seen quite a few versions of this famous story and I must admit that I think all of them are charming in their own right and most of the credit must go to Dickens himself for writing such an amazing story that we all know so well that sometimes it's hard to believe someone could come up with such a clever story and message. I wouldn't say this is my favorite versions of the story, that would probably be the one with George C. Scott, but there's still plenty to enjoy here. What works best is that the film really doesn't add any filler as the thing runs a brief 68-minutes so it's pretty much to the point from start to finish. We briefly get to know the characters and then we're off to the races as the filmmakers are certainly expecting the viewer to know what's going on and who's who. Owen was excellent at playing the "happy" Scrooge but I felt he wasn't nearly mean enough in the darker role. I certainly enjoyed his performance here but it seems like he was either held back from being too dark or he simply didn't go a bit further with the role. On the other hand, he's flawless as the happy Scrooge and really makes that part of the character his very own and is quite memorable in the final moments of the film. Gene Lockhart turns in a very good performance as Cratchit and Barry MacKay is also very good as Scrooge's nephew. Lionel Braham, Ann Rutherford and D'Arcy Corrigan are good as the three spirits and the rest of the supporting cast are also fine in their roles.

    Not the best version of A Christmas Carol(one of Charles Dickens' most famous, best and most accessible stories)- the Alastair Sim and George C. Scott versions, the 1994 Jetlag and 2001 animated films are the only versions below average- and is not perfect. The Ghost of Christmas Past section is too brief and should have been much more- more time, more detail-, the reason why Scrooge seems to have repented too soon in this version, and Terry Kilburn's Tiny Tim is too healthy and overwrought, the character should have a lot of pathos but Kilburn seems to be trying too hard. There is still a lot to like though. The Ghost of Christmas Present section is very heart-warming, definitely of the Three Ghosts sections the one with the most heart, and the one of Christmas-Yet-to-Come will have youngsters diving under the covers, the people in the section observing and commenting on the situation are quite realistically drawn. While not lavish or big in budget, the film still has splendid period detail and shot in lovely black and white. The special effects are not too shabby, though not award-worthy. The whimsical music score, mean-meaning script, heartfelt message that gets its point across and the ceaselessly entertaining and poignant storytelling are other selling points. And the acting is fine on the most part. Reginald Owen does make a great account of himself as Scrooge(if not quite embodying the character like Sim did), while Leo G. Caroll is very spooky if soft-spoken Jacob Marley and Barry MacKay is possibly the best and most likable Fred on screen. Lionel Brahurn's Ghost of Christmas Present is wonderfully jovial, Ann Rutherford is utterly beguiling though deserving of more screen time and Gene Lockhart appeals in how humble he is. Overall, warm, charming and entertaining though not definitive. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    A Christmas Carol is directed by Edwin L. Marin and adapted to screenplay by Hugo Butler from the Charles Dickens story of the same name. It stars Reginald Owen, Gene Lockhart, Kathleen Lockhart, Terry Kilburn and Barry MacKay. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Sidney Wagner and John F. Seitz. I wonder just how many times A Christmas Carol has been adapted to theatre, film, television, radio or opera? Well it's a lot as we know, but my point being that it's one of those literary works that needs no introduction or plot synopsis. It's as famous as famous can be. With all the many "film" adaptations to view, there's often discussions about which is the best, which is the most loyal to the source and etc etc, what mostly comes through in such discussions is that it's such a brilliant piece of literary work it would take the work of an idiot to mess up the feel good factor come the story's denouement. Thankfully, in spite of tampering with aspects of the source material, Marin's 38 version is as pleasing as a glass of Xmas punch. There are minor irritants here no doubt about it, Scrooge begins to turn from mean miser to good fellow a bit too early, and traditionalists do balk at the changes in the story such as a sex change for one of the ghosts, Cratchit gets the sack, the haunting grimness is missing with the ghost visitations and again etc etc, yet the essence is right and the key points are rightfully included. Given it's a film that runs just under 70 minutes some scenes are rushed, but it's very well performed by the cast (Owen wonderfully caustic as Scrooge after stepping in when Lionel Barrymore's ill health ruled him out of the production) and the joy that comes with the finale is simply impossible to ignore. Like a lot of other people I'm a lover of the Alastair Sim 1951 version, of which this MGM version is often unfairly compared against. For although the 51 film is definitive in its adaptation, and rightfully sits at the top of many people's lists of filmic productions, Marin's film has much to recommend it to being part of your perennial Xmas viewing schedules. 8/10

    a special adaptation. Christmas spirit . and more. a good cast. and lovely atmosphere. sure, an antique. but very wise, touching and precise. the old fashion shining is not only virtue. it remains basis of an admirable work. sentimental and good medicine for soul, it is, in same time, a real Dickens. no tricks, no innovation. only lines of a classical story about conquest of a holiday. so, a honest movie. or little more because Reginald Owen does a memorable Scrooge. bitter, warm, seductive. fresh, fragile. perfect character without strange shadows. memory of respectable dear Charles Dickens is present in each performance. and the fragile map of this carol is more important by many other adaptations.

The Ghost of Christmas Present section is very heart-warming, definitely of the Three Ghosts sections the one with the most heart, and the one of Christmas-Yet-to-Come will have youngsters diving under the covers, the people in the section observing and commenting on the situation are quite realistically drawn. While not lavish or big in budget, the film still has splendid period detail and shot in lovely black and white. The special effects are not too shabby, though not award-worthy. The whimsical music score, mean-meaning script, heartfelt message that gets its point across and the ceaselessly entertaining and poignant storytelling are other selling points. And the acting is fine on the most part. Reginald Owen does make a great account of himself as Scrooge(if not quite embodying the character like Sim did), while Leo G. Caroll is very spooky if soft-spoken Jacob Marley and Barry MacKay is possibly the best and most likable Fred on screen. Lionel Brahurn's Ghost of Christmas Present is wonderfully jovial, Ann Rutherford is utterly beguiling though deserving of more screen time and Gene Lockhart appeals in how humble he is. Overall, warm, charming and entertaining though not definitive. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    A Christmas Carol is directed by Edwin L. Marin and adapted to screenplay by Hugo Butler from the Charles Dickens story of the same name. It stars Reginald Owen, Gene Lockhart, Kathleen Lockhart, Terry Kilburn and Barry MacKay. Music is by Franz Waxman and cinematography by Sidney Wagner and John F. Seitz. I wonder just how many times A Christmas Carol has been adapted to theatre, film, television, radio or opera? Well it's a lot as we know, but my point being that it's one of those literary works that needs no introduction or plot synopsis. It's as famous as famous can be. With all the many "film" adaptations to view, there's often discussions about which is the best, which is the most loyal to the source and etc etc, what mostly comes through in such discussions is that it's such a brilliant piece of literary work it would take the work of an idiot to mess up the feel good factor come the story's denouement. Thankfully, in spite of tampering with aspects of the source material, Marin's 38 version is as pleasing as a glass of Xmas punch. There are minor irritants here no doubt about it, Scrooge begins to turn from mean miser to good fellow a bit too early, and traditionalists do balk at the changes in the story such as a sex change for one of the ghosts, Cratchit gets the sack, the haunting grimness is missing with the ghost visitations and again etc etc, yet the essence is right and the key points are rightfully included. Given it's a film that runs just under 70 minutes some scenes are rushed, but it's very well performed by the cast (Owen wonderfully caustic as Scrooge after stepping in when Lionel Barrymore's ill health ruled him out of the production) and the joy that comes with the finale is simply impossible to ignore. Like a lot of other people I'm a lover of the Alastair Sim 1951 version, of which this MGM version is often unfairly compared against. For although the 51 film is definitive in its adaptation, and rightfully sits at the top of many people's lists of filmic productions, Marin's film has much to recommend it to being part of your perennial Xmas viewing schedules. 8/10

    a special adaptation. Christmas spirit . and more. a good cast. and lovely atmosphere. sure, an antique. but very wise, touching and precise. the old fashion shining is not only virtue. it remains basis of an admirable work. sentimental and good medicine for soul, it is, in same time, a real Dickens. no tricks, no innovation. only lines of a classical story about conquest of a holiday. so, a honest movie. or little more because Reginald Owen does a memorable Scrooge. bitter, warm, seductive. fresh, fragile. perfect character without strange shadows. memory of respectable dear Charles Dickens is present in each performance. and the fragile map of this carol is more important by many other adaptations.

    There's plenty of adaptations of A Christmas Carol out there and it's likely that, if you're going to delve into Christmas past, you may get no further than the 1951 version starring Alastair Sim. However, this one from 13 years earlier is also worthy of a look, even if it does take a few liberties with the story. I'm of the opinion that there's little point deviating too much from the source, as A Christmas Carol might just be the greatest spec script in English literature. Perfectly paced and with endless quotable dialogue, it really shouldn't be too hard to get a serviceable movie out of an adaptation. Perhaps that's why my biggest problems with this version are when it deviates from the source; such as Scrooge sacking Cratchett on Christmas Eve (making Bob Cratchett's toast to him the following day utterly bizarre), or the fact that Tiny Tim seems remarkably healthy for someone who has few Christmasses in their future. The largest oversight is the absence of Scrooge's lost-love Belle from the story, perhaps because it's the biggest indication of just why the old man is so bitter and miserly. Curiously, despite omitting this character, there's a bigger role for Fred's partner (his fianc&eacute;e in this, rather than his wife). Why the film decides to focus on this couple without counter-balancing it with Scrooge's own sad love-story is a bit of a mystery. Aside from that, it's really not too bad. It tells the story well and doesn't look nearly as old as it actually is. But in a world of countless versions of this story, it is a little forgettable - neither bad enough to stick in the mind, nor interesting enough to join the ranks of Sim, Scott and the Muppets.

    In the Nineteenth Century, in London, the bitter, greedy and cranky Ebenezer Scrooge (Reginald Owen) hates Christmas and people. He runs his business exploiting his employee Bob Cratchit (Gene Lockhart) and spends unfriendly treatment to his nephew Fred (Barry MacKay) and acquaintances. In the Christmas Eve, he is visited by the doomed chained ghost of his former partner Jacob Marley (Leo G. Carroll), who died seven years ago and tells him that three spirits would visit him that night. The first one, the spirit of past Christmas, recalls his happy childhood and coming of age; the spirit of the present Christmas shows him the poor situation of Bob's family and the happiness of Fred and his fianc&eacute;e Bessy; and the spirit of future Christmas shows his fate. Scrooge finds that life is good and finds redemption changing thoughts about Christmas, Bob, tiny Tim, his nephew and people in general. "A Christmas Carol" is one of the most beautiful Christmas tales in the cinema. I do not recall how many adaptations of one of the most known Charles Dickens' short story I have seen but this 1938 is also wonderful. I do not have much more to say but recommend this magnificent family entertainment. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Um Conto de Natal" ("A Christmas Tale")

    WOW, My first ever movie from the 30's , I never thought I would ever see a movie from 30s This movie version felt bit more different then 1951, I felt there were more fun parts in this movie and very good feel to the movie, while you are you feeling kinda of happy and cheerfully As-well As I only seem 1951 version first time few weeks ago, in still in my head, I was comparing both parts. I found scrooge it bit more nasty at the start of the movie, as movies goes, I don't feel think it was as good guy who played Scooge in 1951 version. Near the end of the movie, I think it was going little over the top, it went a bit too Jolly. I going to give this movie 7 out of 10, not as good as 1951. Might be seeing 1935 version later,

    In the 1970's KTTV Channel 11 in Los Angles would play this film on Christmas Eve at 11:00pm. My parents would be mad because my two sisters and I would be watching this in oldest My sister's room. It was a tradition that we did for years (Keeping my parents up well past Midnight on Christmas Eve I am sure was very hard on them). This version was my introduction to the story of Mr Scrooge and II will forever hold dear in my heart because it is a favorite Christmas Memory! Its not the gifts that I got it was just watching and enjoying this film with my sisters. Now there have been better adaption however this version is very well made and there is something about this Old B/W movie that will always bring a smile in my heart. To me its not Christmas unless I get a chance to watch this version. I hope one day my sisters and I can watch this again together on Christmas Eve. To me that would be a perfect Christmas gift.

    It occurred to me while watching this film the other day that back when I was a kid, I probably saw this and the Alistair Sim version interchangeably without realizing they were two different pictures. While I prefer the later British film as an adult, I can agree that this 'warmer' treatment of the holiday classic is just as watchable and enjoyable to get into the Christmas spirit. The other thing I didn't realize was that Gene Lockhart, portraying Bob Cratchit, played opposite his real life wife Kathleen in the Mrs. Cratchit role. Rounding out the family connection is daughter June Lockhart appearing in an uncredited part as one of the Cratchit children. Great stuff you pick up on Turner Classics. No one needs to be reminded of the story, so I'll pass on that. Interestingly, Reginald Owen's performance of the miserly Scrooge would wind up being his only lead role in a picture. And to think it would be the result of an injury to Lionel Barrymore, originally cast for the part until he sustained an injury on another film set. Funny how things work out in a way where another actor in a role might have changed forever one's perception of a film. I like to watch 'A Christmas Carol' every Christmas Eve, and though I can't arrange for a light snowfall every year, when it occurs that's always a nice bonus. This year I'll pop in the Alistair Sim picture once again; the challenge being that for the first time, I've talked myself into checking out the colorized version.

    Lavish MGM sets are the highlight of this version of Ebenezer Scrooge, with a haughty, abrasive performance as the miser by Reginald Owen. As mentioned by multiple other reviews, this version is heavily truncated. While I do love David Warner as the character in 1984's version with George C Scott as the miser, my all time favorite is Gene Lockhart who is just delightful as Bob Cratchet, a fine fellow often assaulted by Scrooge's stubborn, greedy ways. Lockhart is particularly amusing the way he quivers in fear when Scrooge enters the room, demanding less coal and more work. Interesting enough Owen hunches over and walks almost insect like, a scowl and sneer for anyone who offers Christmas cheer. In this version Scrooge fires Cratchet for hitting him accidentally with a snowball, knocking his top hat into the street to be run over by a horse carriage. In this version Scrooge actually calls neighborhood watch into his room to rid himself of "intruder" Jacob Marley. In this version the Ghost of Christmas Past is a beautiful woman. While this version does have his sister visiting him at school, we do not see Scrooge meeting with his cold hearted father. And we never see Scrooge's relationship with his girlfriend and the deterioration of it due to greed which tore them apart. Nor do we see Scrooge's betrayal of Fezziwig(Fezzi makes a brief appearance informing Scrooge he must attend his holiday party)or the visit to his dying sister's bedside. Regarding the Ghost of Christmas Present, he isn't a towering figure as we are accustomed to seeing, but we do spend a great deal of time with Cratchet's family(actually, interesting enough, this film has more time for the family than with Scrooge's many failings as a person). There's an emphasis on playing in the snowy streets. Scrooge visits the city church where we see Bob and Tiny Tim, nephew Fred and his fianc&eacute;, singing "O Come All Ye Faithful". Scrooge looks on spellbound from the window with Ghost Present as Fred and company discuss Ebenezer and Blindman's Bluff. Ghost Present even uses his horn to sprinkle "christmas cheer" on those who need it. The love in Cratchet's family rings true(Gene would star with real life wife Katherine and daughter June)and feels genuine which tugs on our heartstrings when Tim later is established to have died when Scrooge visits their more solemn home with the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come(which while appearing in Grim Reaper garb is less frightening than in other versions). Regarding the Future Scrooge visits his death bed and tombstone, not to mention, he listens as businessmen discuss his demise with lack of any remorse whatsoever. A Christmas CAROL is over in a flash and doesn't cover as much ground as other versions, but Reginald Owen's only star vehicle does provide some nice moments, including his besieging the Cratchets(Bob's surprise at the sight of a Scrooge bearing gifts is golden)with a goose and presents; as well as, his visit to Fred and his fianc&eacute;, promising to make the young man partner.

    Christmas Carol, A (1938) *** (out of 4) Nice adaptation of Charles Dickens short story has character actor Reginald Owen playing the role of the miser Ebenezer Scrooge. Everyone should know the story but Scrooge is warned by his old partner Marley (Leo G. Carroll) that he's going to be visited by three ghosts and his fate depends on what he learns. I've seen quite a few versions of this famous story and I must admit that I think all of them are charming in their own right and most of the credit must go to Dickens himself for writing such an amazing story that we all know so well that sometimes it's hard to believe someone could come up with such a clever story and message. I wouldn't say this is my favorite versions of the story, that would probably be the one with George C. Scott, but there's still plenty to enjoy here. What works best is that the film really doesn't add any filler as the thing runs a brief 68-minutes so it's pretty much to the point from start to finish. We briefly get to know the characters and then we're off to the races as the filmmakers are certainly expecting the viewer to know what's going on and who's who. Owen was excellent at playing the "happy" Scrooge but I felt he wasn't nearly mean enough in the darker role. I certainly enjoyed his performance here but it seems like he was either held back from being too dark or he simply didn't go a bit further with the role. On the other hand, he's flawless as the happy Scrooge and really makes that part of the character his very own and is quite memorable in the final moments of the film. Gene Lockhart turns in a very good performance as Cratchit and Barry MacKay is also very good as Scrooge's nephew. Lionel Braham, Ann Rutherford and D'Arcy Corrigan are good as the three spirits and the rest of the supporting cast are also fine in their roles.
