 <sinopse>
  A day in the lives of two convenience clerks named Dante and Randal as they annoy customers, discuss movies, and play hockey on the store roof.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Dante Hicks is a clerk at a local convenience store in New Jersey. On one particular Saturday morning, he gets called in on his day off. Once there, he must deal with multiple problems. The shutters outside won't open. His ex-girlfriend, whom he is still in love with, is getting married. His girlfriend, who bugs him about starting college, has revealed certain, uh...stuff about her past. His boss hasn't come in to take his place. He has a hockey game at 2 o'clock. Another ex has died, and today's the last day he can go to her wake. He must deal with customers that aren't so intelligent. His friend, Randal, a clerk at the video store next door, is even less dedicated to his job than Dante, and is always bothering Dante's customers. And the biggest problem of them all: HE'S NOT EVEN SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TODAY!! Can Dante manage it all?

    Clerks. What a film. Clerks is obviously supposed to be a comedy, and it is very funny. But I like to consider Clerks a "dialogue film". The dialogue in this film is fantastic.Every line is very realistic and the actors deliver them perfectly. The performances from the actors are amazing. Each character speaks how real people speak and are pretty funny. The realism of the film is amazing, with conversations about movies, dumb people and hockey. They all seem so real, I can't get over it. I have only seen Clerks once but it is one of my favorite films. It's a shame lots of people won't view this film, just because it's black and white. Kevin smith takes time with each shot, placing the characters carefully in each scene. The acting and cinematography are brilliant. Today directors just don't understand how to write good dialogue in a comedy, most comedies are very cheesy. Dante is a relatable and likable character who you are rooting for the whole way through and Randall is so funny. The way he talks about movies and other situations are excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are brilliant characters, I love seeing them in Kevin Smith's other films. Clerks is a film all movie lovers should see. "I'm not even supposed to be here today". - Dante Hicks.

    Clerks. I have nothing but positive things to say about this film. Kevin Smith displayed a fantastically written movie that shows the viewer that their life doesn't suck so badly compared to Dante's. I could not stop laughing the whole time I was enjoying this film. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. With a cast that perfectly portrays a plucky and real cast of characters, and some of the most memorable pieces of dialogue I can think of, Smith has given a fantastic gift to the world of realistic, if not somewhat pessimistic, comedy. This is a film that everyone deserves to enjoy before they die. A film built out of dialogue that keeps you in a perpetual state of thought, all while laughing your hat off.

    Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot. Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. "I'm 37?" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.

    Kevin Smith's debut indie feature is one of the most influential comedies ever made as well as one of the most idiosyncratic. Its characters, writing and tone perfectly set this as a masterpiece in the genre and Smith's best work. A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    Rarely do comedies so atypical become as famous as Clerks, which is the reason why it's such a cult classic. Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy

    Clerks. What a film. Clerks is obviously supposed to be a comedy, and it is very funny. But I like to consider Clerks a "dialogue film". The dialogue in this film is fantastic.Every line is very realistic and the actors deliver them perfectly. The performances from the actors are amazing. Each character speaks how real people speak and are pretty funny. The realism of the film is amazing, with conversations about movies, dumb people and hockey. They all seem so real, I can't get over it. I have only seen Clerks once but it is one of my favorite films. It's a shame lots of people won't view this film, just because it's black and white. Kevin smith takes time with each shot, placing the characters carefully in each scene. The acting and cinematography are brilliant. Today directors just don't understand how to write good dialogue in a comedy, most comedies are very cheesy. Dante is a relatable and likable character who you are rooting for the whole way through and Randall is so funny. The way he talks about movies and other situations are excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are brilliant characters, I love seeing them in Kevin Smith's other films. Clerks is a film all movie lovers should see. "I'm not even supposed to be here today". - Dante Hicks.

    Clerks. I have nothing but positive things to say about this film. Kevin Smith displayed a fantastically written movie that shows the viewer that their life doesn't suck so badly compared to Dante's. I could not stop laughing the whole time I was enjoying this film. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. With a cast that perfectly portrays a plucky and real cast of characters, and some of the most memorable pieces of dialogue I can think of, Smith has given a fantastic gift to the world of realistic, if not somewhat pessimistic, comedy. This is a film that everyone deserves to enjoy before they die. A film built out of dialogue that keeps you in a perpetual state of thought, all while laughing your hat off.

    Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot. Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. "I'm 37?" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.

    Kevin Smith's debut indie feature is one of the most influential comedies ever made as well as one of the most idiosyncratic. Its characters, writing and tone perfectly set this as a masterpiece in the genre and Smith's best work. A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    Rarely do comedies so atypical become as famous as Clerks, which is the reason why it's such a cult classic. Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy

    Clerks. What a film. Clerks is obviously supposed to be a comedy, and it is very funny. But I like to consider Clerks a "dialogue film". The dialogue in this film is fantastic.Every line is very realistic and the actors deliver them perfectly. The performances from the actors are amazing. Each character speaks how real people speak and are pretty funny. The realism of the film is amazing, with conversations about movies, dumb people and hockey. They all seem so real, I can't get over it. I have only seen Clerks once but it is one of my favorite films. It's a shame lots of people won't view this film, just because it's black and white. Kevin smith takes time with each shot, placing the characters carefully in each scene. The acting and cinematography are brilliant. Today directors just don't understand how to write good dialogue in a comedy, most comedies are very cheesy. Dante is a relatable and likable character who you are rooting for the whole way through and Randall is so funny. The way he talks about movies and other situations are excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are brilliant characters, I love seeing them in Kevin Smith's other films. Clerks is a film all movie lovers should see. "I'm not even supposed to be here today". - Dante Hicks.

    Clerks. I have nothing but positive things to say about this film. Kevin Smith displayed a fantastically written movie that shows the viewer that their life doesn't suck so badly compared to Dante's. I could not stop laughing the whole time I was enjoying this film. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. With a cast that perfectly portrays a plucky and real cast of characters, and some of the most memorable pieces of dialogue I can think of, Smith has given a fantastic gift to the world of realistic, if not somewhat pessimistic, comedy. This is a film that everyone deserves to enjoy before they die. A film built out of dialogue that keeps you in a perpetual state of thought, all while laughing your hat off.

    Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot. Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. "I'm 37?" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.

    Kevin Smith's debut indie feature is one of the most influential comedies ever made as well as one of the most idiosyncratic. Its characters, writing and tone perfectly set this as a masterpiece in the genre and Smith's best work. A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    Rarely do comedies so atypical become as famous as Clerks, which is the reason why it's such a cult classic. Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy

    Clerks. What a film. Clerks is obviously supposed to be a comedy, and it is very funny. But I like to consider Clerks a "dialogue film". The dialogue in this film is fantastic.Every line is very realistic and the actors deliver them perfectly. The performances from the actors are amazing. Each character speaks how real people speak and are pretty funny. The realism of the film is amazing, with conversations about movies, dumb people and hockey. They all seem so real, I can't get over it. I have only seen Clerks once but it is one of my favorite films. It's a shame lots of people won't view this film, just because it's black and white. Kevin smith takes time with each shot, placing the characters carefully in each scene. The acting and cinematography are brilliant. Today directors just don't understand how to write good dialogue in a comedy, most comedies are very cheesy. Dante is a relatable and likable character who you are rooting for the whole way through and Randall is so funny. The way he talks about movies and other situations are excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are brilliant characters, I love seeing them in Kevin Smith's other films. Clerks is a film all movie lovers should see. "I'm not even supposed to be here today". - Dante Hicks.

    Clerks. I have nothing but positive things to say about this film. Kevin Smith displayed a fantastically written movie that shows the viewer that their life doesn't suck so badly compared to Dante's. I could not stop laughing the whole time I was enjoying this film. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. With a cast that perfectly portrays a plucky and real cast of characters, and some of the most memorable pieces of dialogue I can think of, Smith has given a fantastic gift to the world of realistic, if not somewhat pessimistic, comedy. This is a film that everyone deserves to enjoy before they die. A film built out of dialogue that keeps you in a perpetual state of thought, all while laughing your hat off.

    Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot. Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. "I'm 37?" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.

    Kevin Smith's debut indie feature is one of the most influential comedies ever made as well as one of the most idiosyncratic. Its characters, writing and tone perfectly set this as a masterpiece in the genre and Smith's best work. A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    Rarely do comedies so atypical become as famous as Clerks, which is the reason why it's such a cult classic. Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy

    Clerks. What a film. Clerks is obviously supposed to be a comedy, and it is very funny. But I like to consider Clerks a "dialogue film". The dialogue in this film is fantastic.Every line is very realistic and the actors deliver them perfectly. The performances from the actors are amazing. Each character speaks how real people speak and are pretty funny. The realism of the film is amazing, with conversations about movies, dumb people and hockey. They all seem so real, I can't get over it. I have only seen Clerks once but it is one of my favorite films. It's a shame lots of people won't view this film, just because it's black and white. Kevin smith takes time with each shot, placing the characters carefully in each scene. The acting and cinematography are brilliant. Today directors just don't understand how to write good dialogue in a comedy, most comedies are very cheesy. Dante is a relatable and likable character who you are rooting for the whole way through and Randall is so funny. The way he talks about movies and other situations are excellent. Jay and Silent Bob are brilliant characters, I love seeing them in Kevin Smith's other films. Clerks is a film all movie lovers should see. "I'm not even supposed to be here today". - Dante Hicks.

    Clerks. I have nothing but positive things to say about this film. Kevin Smith displayed a fantastically written movie that shows the viewer that their life doesn't suck so badly compared to Dante's. I could not stop laughing the whole time I was enjoying this film. I could watch it over and over and never get tired of it. With a cast that perfectly portrays a plucky and real cast of characters, and some of the most memorable pieces of dialogue I can think of, Smith has given a fantastic gift to the world of realistic, if not somewhat pessimistic, comedy. This is a film that everyone deserves to enjoy before they die. A film built out of dialogue that keeps you in a perpetual state of thought, all while laughing your hat off.

    Poor Dante. He's not even supposed to be here today. But on his supposed day off he has been called in to work. He's just a lowly clerk in a convenience store so you'd think Dante would be in for a very boring day. What interesting things could possibly happen in a convenience store? Well, thanks to the brilliant script from Kevin Smith we get to peek in on what has to be the most eventful day in convenience store history. On this day the Quick Stop will prove to be Dante's personal hell. And he doesn't even get the worst of it. Not by a long shot. Clerks is among the most gleefully profane films ever made and yet it manages to have great charm. You can't help but sympathize with poor Dante, even when he's acting like a bit of a cad, going behind his ever-loving and faithful girlfriend's back to try to hook up with an ex. And Dante has the perfect comic foil in Randal, who works at the video store next door. In reality Randal really doesn't work at all, he just hangs out at the Quick Stop with his best bud Dante. And the interaction between this pair is priceless, every conversation they have is pure comic gold. Randal is a guy who will do or say absolutely anything and Smith uses that to great effect. Randal goes way over the line, providing an abundance of laugh out loud moments. Did he really say that? Yeah, he did. The movie is performed by a cast of amateur, completely unpolished actors. And that proves to be a very good thing. It helps the movie feel real. There's nothing forced or fake about it. These are real people, real Jersey people with the type of edge to them you wouldn't see in most other places. Everyone in the cast, from those playing the main characters all the way down to those on the screen for mere moments playing annoying customers, is excellent. The performers may not be polished but that doesn't mean they are bad actors, quite the contrary. Jeff Anderson, playing Randal, is a standout and Brian O'Halloran is great as well in playing the put-upon Dante. Of course Dante and Randal are not the only dynamic duo in this movie. There's also Jason Mewes and Smith himself as Jay and Silent Bob adding some laughs and maybe even some wisdom. The movie crackles along with some of the wittiest dialogue ever put to film. Few movies are as quotable as this. Whether Dante and Randal are discussing their menial jobs or the destruction of the Death Star the dialogue sparkles throughout. You don't even need context. "I'm 37?" Just hearing that is enough for fans of the film to laugh and give a knowing nod. So many hilarious little moments in this movie. And some truly outrageous big moments as well including a twist of fate at the end which is wonderfully set up and pays off in rather unbelievable fashion. The movie is so rude and crude and yet it is rightfully beloved. People love this movie, these characters, this story. Absolutely brilliant stuff from Kevin Smith and his terrific cast. World, don't say New Jersey never gave you anything. Please accept this movie as our gift to you. If you don't like it I may have to go all Berserker on you.

    Kevin Smith's debut indie feature is one of the most influential comedies ever made as well as one of the most idiosyncratic. Its characters, writing and tone perfectly set this as a masterpiece in the genre and Smith's best work. A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

A host of spin-off films, a direct sequel released 12 years later and an animated series would also follow afterwards, instituting this film's foothold and it remains one of my favourite films ever made. Dante Hicks and Randal Graves are two twenty-two year-old friends working at a convenience store and a video store respectively. One day in their lives involves them discussing Star Wars, annoying customers, girlfriends along with playing roof hockey and visiting the funeral of an old flame of Dante's. Dante also meets another old girlfriend of his, Caitlin, and becomes interested in her despite his relationship with Veronica and what happens is a seemingly disastrous and unlucky turn of events in Dante's already pathetic life. Smith's vulgar yet witty dialogue is put to good use here. The script is possibly the best thing about this film as it helps create some likability out of these characters even when they act like doofuses. Dante is portrayed as a moany and fickle guy who juggles with a woman too many yet we can't help but feel for him due to his bad luck and feel of boredom at his dead end job. Randal is the standout character; a mischievous and smart mouthed slacker who annoys his best friend yet also shows a brotherly appreciation for Dante. Jay and Silent Bob, two drug dealers who hang outside the store, also provide entertaining supporting work. The two characters became so popular that they re- appeared in supporting roles in Smith's following works and even became the focus of their own feature film also directed by Smith. The tone of Clerks is portrayed as somber and at times depressing despite the witty humour and fast pace. The low budget style of film making adds a lot of perception to the film. Because of budget constraints, Smith was unable to shoot with a camera in colour and resorted to black and white cinematography. This, however, works in showing the mood of the film and reflects the emotions of the characters. The feeling of being a slacker is explored heavily in this film and asks the question of why we do what we do when we hate it. Clerks is a tremendous work that appeals to its audience by telling us that we are not alone; as in, slackers who do nothing but discuss Star Wars and porn and are stuck in dead end jobs. Kevin Smith makes this work in such a way that makes it both funny and thoughtful. Comedies like these succeed because they make you laugh and they make you think and feel as well, a quality that many comedies today fail at in both areas.

    Clerks, shot entirely in black and white, obeys the Aristotelian unities of time, place and action in the sense that it captures the lives of Dante and his friend Randall (who are two store clerks) during the duration of a single day, concerned mainly with their interactions with the store customers. The dialogue is smart, rather too smart for normal conversation. Clerks is a smart comedy, the kind that requires you to pay good attention to. Rather big words were shown against a black backdrop at regular intervals during the film. I found this a tad annoying as I didn't really know what half of these words meant. The movie showed me that handling customers is not an easy job. It's a decent low-budget film, is deserving of the cult-following that it has.

    I loved where Kevin Smith was coming from in his writing, placing a less-than-intimidating, "pudgy" guy in a scuzzy job that's placed next to the county a-hole who doesn't seem to help in any circumstance whatsoever other than ridiculing anything that dare cross him, but he only adds to the other countless hardships that makes life a beautiful inevitability most everyone must face; strange and pestilent customers, brutal reality checks, and a pinch from the law that somebody else oughta get pinched for. The beautiful inevitabilities Kevin Smith exposes makes this film an inevitable beauty, cinematography aside, and makes for what is an empowering, gaudily written (not a bad thing), relate-able must-see experience.

    Rarely do comedies so atypical become as famous as Clerks, which is the reason why it's such a cult classic. Directed by d&eacute;butante Kevin Smith, this is the film that gave the film-maker attention in the movie industry. Clerks is easily one of the funniest comedies of the 90's, if not the funniest. Dante is a Clerk at a convenient store who on a Saturday reluctantly goes to work, and finds it to be an awful day as he struggles with his girlfriend, client-insulting Randall (his best friend), who works at the video store attached to Dante's workplace. Dante throughout the day reminds himself of his directionless life, and finds it hard to accept it, although he doesn't feel the need to make a change. On behalf of Kevin Smith, the talent lays in the brilliantly funny writing: he divides the film in individual skits of that day. In each one of them, he proves he can really write a great, casual conversation and make it feel so quotidian and natural, even with all of the smart comebacks. On the background is one of the most grim, grey representations of American suburbia, more in particular New Jersey suburbia. Although the movie is always hilarious, there is that implicit sadness that permeates the environment, which is even more highlighted by the black-and- white, cheap cinematography. These characters are stuck there for the rest of their lives, despite them being only 22. It's a film that speaks to young adults, not only for being funny but for the fact that a lot of the background is, unfortunately, very familiar to a lot of kids.

    Clerks is a difficult movie to rate, because it's an acquired taste. Once you understand's Kevin Smith's sense of story telling and style of humor, then you'll appreciate his debut flick. This piece presents to us seemingly unrelated life events in a day of two clerks. Their dialogs present facts of life in a basic yet articulate way with a slight ring of nerdy pot smokers. It's black and white, with shaky camera shots, awkward angles, amateur acting, and seedy sets that scream low budget. Yet, the ideas and philosophy on display will make you think. Overall, it entertaining, but to fully appreciate it, you better have a good Smith education, so start by watching Dogma, or Chasing Amy, or even Mallrats. If you like them, then you're ready for this film, and you will most likely enjoy it.

    I watched this for the first time the other day, expecting - after noting all the plaudits - it to be something special. I came away thinking it had its moments and felt unusual, but overall, the whole thing didn't impress me for various reasons: 1. The lines often sounded unnatural and not as you'd expect the characters to speak( maybe that's an intentional part of the comedy? ) 2. The acting was a very mixed bag; 3. There were few funny moments; 4. The story was far too limited - with a severe lack of really fun, memorable moments. I can sort of appreciate why lots of people really like this film, but I think it's over-hyped. I can't understand why anyone would give it more than 7/10. I think Kevin Smith and his crew did a good job, but it's not anything sensational imo. It's a reasonable bit of down to earth, amateurish entertainment - nothing more.

    Did I say underrated? Sorry, I meant overrated. Well, a friend of mine recommended this movie, notably after I asked him 'if he could recommend me a few good movies'. Needless to say, this so-called friend is in the defriendzone now. No, seriously, this movie has to be viewed as a 'cult-movie', shot with minimal budget, in black-and-white, by a young director and with amateur actors. So you have to give the director credit for that. Taken that all in account, this still makes the movie overrated. See above and below for reasons and proof. I would rate it 5, but I rated it 0, to have it removed from the IMDb top- 250. If you want to compare this movie with another movie, check out 'Man bites dog', a Belgian movie, made with less budget (<50.000$), shot in the same year, also in black-and- white, using young and unprofessional actors. What a difference in quality! Amazing dialogue, inventive script, convincing acting, unique characters, humour,... Man bites dog has it all. People in Belgium and France (and French Canada I suppose) can recite whole dialogues by heart. Just like Americans can with Pulp Fiction. Benoit Poelvoorde, the main actor, is really talented and this movie was the start of his career. A career that comprises leading roles in some of the biggest movies. Just saying... If you want to compare. Enjoy
