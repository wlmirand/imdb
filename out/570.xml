    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    A Flawed But Beautifully Filmed And Well Acted Epic Western Biopic About The Legendary Lawman.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom.

Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    A Flawed But Beautifully Filmed And Well Acted Epic Western Biopic About The Legendary Lawman.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.

    Critic...a person who knows the price of everything and the value of nothing. I don't know who said that, but I like it. I am writing this more for my wife than myself as she is a die-hard Western Movie Fan. C'mon...it's a movie. Maybe somewhat inaccurate in the historical part, but yet I have found history gets re-written every day. We just enjoyed the movie. Enjoyed some younger faces of older actors. Surprizing appearance by at least one, that being Jim Caviezel as the younger Earp brother. We both liked the down-to-earth life experiences we saw in the Earp families that were forced (or lead) throughout the country for a better life. Each brother had their story if one looked for it. Let me mention just one thing about historical accuracy. The only historical book or reference I have come to rely on is the Bible. So I suppose that automatically makes me a critic of American History. Damn straight....glad you caught it. Grab the popcorn...enjoy the movie.......Q(:-}

    It's a Long Trial That Has No Turning.

    Man, at 122 minutes, this is a longie. Probably three separate movies could have been made from this material. (1) Young Wyatt finally wins the girl he loves back home in Missouri and she promptly get pregnant and dies in his arms. Wyatt turns into a drunk before he finds himself. That one goes straight to Lifetime Movie Network. (2) After a few years of being a roustabout, Wyatt and his brother become deputy marshals, first in Dodge City, then in Tombstone. The Clanton brothers and a few other miscreants get nasty and it all leads to the famous shootout at the O.K. Corral. (3) Not all of the villains are dead and the surviving ones vow revenge. Another climactic shoot out at a train station in Tucson. Yes, there are several movies buried in this script, and actually at least four have already been made: "Tombstone," "My Darling Clementine," "Shootout at the O.K. Corral", and "Hour of the Gun." Almost time for the story to be told from the Clanton's perspective. In watching these highly ritualized Westerns it's important to understand why the values we see being embraced were, in fact, being embraced. Pardon me, while I adjust this lectern. And, please, let's not throw any more spitballs. The United States was essentially founded on two independent cultures, the theocracies of the North, the Puritans or Roundhead as they were sometimes called, and the South was settled by Cavaliers, who were men of stern honor. The English philosopher, Thomas Hobbes, had argued that the natural state of man was utter savagery, a "war of all against all," unless some kind of authority was introduced. In the settled communities of the North, that authority was the law and obeisance to God. In the South, authority rested with the individual, built on personal dignity, and a distaste for central authority. As the country spread westward, so did these different conceptions of responsibility. Southerners were existentialists of a sort. A man was what he made of himself. Or, to put it in the parlance of the Western film, "A man's gotta do what a man's gotta do," or, "When you call me that, smile." The various shoot outs we see in this movie are only modernized forms of Medieval jousts or duels with sword or pistol. Wyatt Earp violates "the law" he's supposed to uphold numerous times and is charged with murder. He and his friends get off because the law is weak and the judge sees "no criminal offense" in the murder. A Texas judge, a few years ago, was informed of a homicide and asked: "Did he NEED killin'?" And that, boys and girls, is why the North is blue and the South is red. And let's cut out those spitballs, please. Lots of well-known names in this cast list. It often helps to understand what kind of Western you're getting into if you look at the heroes and villains. The heroes no longer wear white hats and the villains black. We're not THAT simple minded anymore. But usually, as here, the villains are creepy, oily, ugly, and/or filthy. Costner does okay by the role of Wyatt, and Dennis Quaid almost always turns in a good performance. As a tubercular, Quaid has been decked out by wardrobe in suits that are wrinkled and too large for him, as if he's wasting away before our eyes. And towards the end, his face has grown pale and his eyes are rimmed with a touch of red. Not too much. Just enough. Nice job. Some of the recognizable names aren't on screen much. Mark Harmon, as a sheriff, barely shows up. Isabella Rossellini, my supporting player in "Blue Velvet," has only one scene. Jim Caviezel is hardly seen. But then a lot of the characters are so ragged and bundled up and covered with soil that they're hard to identify. Joanna Going has an important role and doesn't bring it home effectively. It's a long and complex story and though it does raise some moral questions, there's never any doubt about whose side we're on. In a world of Cavaliers, you must wield a sabre with skill and determination. And in the end, what has Wyatt Earp learned? Nothing. In that respect, it's very different from Clint Eastwood's "Unforgiven."

    I saw Tombstone 4-5 times in the theater and loved it! Then about a year later, I went to a second-run theater and practically fell asleep watching Kasdan's Wyatt Earp. Here it is 2013 and the film is almost 20 years old. Thank goodness I decided to give it another look. It had me from the first scene with Costner alone in the saloon smoking a cigar and sipping coffee before the OK coral fight. I recommend giving this film another look if you saw it on the heels of Tombstone back in 94. It is the far superior movie. I loved every scene with Gene Hackman delivering his fatherly wisdom. Oh and the score by James Newton Howard is amazing. You will recognize parts from other high profile films using it for trailer music.

    In the summer of 2013 Wyatt Earp has been showing up regularly on cable. I thought I'd view it again to see if it worked better in my living room than in a multiplex. It does, though just barely. Although this is not the silly, Baby Boomer mess that Silverado was, WE is final proof that Westerns are not in Lawrence Kasdan's area of competence. For Costner, it's another of the bloated vanity projects that crashed his career after multiple Oscars wins for the majestic Dances With Wolves. As I said, it does view better on the small screen; which is small comfort for the viewer. It's too long, it's humorless and it has that grungy, unshaved, unwashed look that hack film makers mistake for "authenticity." Costner, at this point in his career, didn't want to share the screen with equals. So he surrounds himself with mainly B-list co-stars, Gene Hackman being the sole exception. Some give good performances: Mark Harmon is a terrifically sleazy Johnny Behan, for example. And Dennis Quaid gives one of the very best portrayals of the legendary Doc Holiday. Unfortunately for him, the absolute best on screen Doc is Val Kilmer in the rival Wyatt Earp film, Tombstone. Still, it may be his finest performance on film. On the other end, the usually gifted Mare Winningham is lost as Earp's mistress, Mattie Blaylock. That Costner let his ego overwhelm the film is, finally, what dooms it. Dominating screen time while dispensing with the warmth, humor and sex appeal of his previous films, his Earp is relentlessly vicious and morbidly sullen throughout. In the end, the best way to watch the film is to wander the house doing chores while running to the TV room only when you hear on screen threats or gunfire.

    First off, Congress should pass a law that Kevin Costner will not be allowed to make any film lasting longer than 119 minutes. That will immediately cut down on the suffering of movie-goers. Of course, I'm joking...sort of. Costner was originally associated with the film "Tombstone", but didn't agree with the way the production was going. So, he set off on his own project. That was a mistake. Perhaps Costner's version was more accurate...I'm not sure. But I do know that accuracy doesn't always make the better film. "Tombstone" ranks as one of the truly great Westerns. "Wyatt Earp" simply doesn't rate...at all. The acting here is fine...but rather depressing. Where's the likable character? Ah, there's a flaw. We learn that Wyatt Earp was pretty unlikable. In fact, non one here was very likable. Kevin Costner does his job (of course, that's not a very big compliment). Dennis Quaid was interesting as Doc Holliday, but not as entertaining as Val Kilmer's Holliday. Gene Hackman as the Earp father has very few minutes on screen. Mark Harmon...misused. Bill Pullman was okay as Ed Masterson. Tom Sizemore somewhat interesting as Bat Masterson. Mare Winningham not at all interesting. I totally missed Jim Caviezel as Warren Earp. No, Kevin, you messed up. And the nearly $40 million loss at the box office rather proves that. Not recommended. It's dull and boring and lasts forever.

    A Flawed But Beautifully Filmed And Well Acted Epic Western Biopic About The Legendary Lawman.

    Wyatt Earp is a flawed but beautifully filmed and wonderfully acted Epic Western Biopic that has great direction,a fantastic cast,glorious cinematography and a powerful score that makes Wyatt Earp a good and almost great film that sadly falls short of being a Masterpiece. Wyatt Earp tells the epic story of legendary Lawman Wyatt Earp(Kevin Costner)from his days as a teenager to when he became a Marshal and participated in The Gunfight At The O.K Corell and it's aftermath and the the journey of Wyatt Earp who deals with the law,his family and love in his journey throughout the West. Released in 1994,Wyatt Earp was the second of two Wyatt Earp films this film being released six months after the classic Western Tombstone. While Tombstone was a critical and Box Office hit grossing 55 million dollars on a 25 million dollar budget,Wyatt Earp was a critical and Box Office failure grossing 25 million dollars on a 63 million dollar film budget and was considered the weakest of the two Wyatt Earp films. But Wyatt Earp isn't a bad film in my opinion it's a pretty good film that has some merits. What's good about this film is that Wyatt Earp tells the Wyatt Earp story that many viewers have never seen before telling us a story of how Wyatt Earp became Wyatt Earp that we know in the West and history books showing Wyatt in his early life when he was a wagon driver,a buffalo hunter and gambler and telling us in an epic scope. Wyatt Earp gives us a dark character study of a man who is flawed and has to deal with the good and bad times of what Wyatt Earp went through from when he was a teenager to when he was a grown up and shows how Wyatt goes from the happy optimistic young man to a cold hearted lawman he became in his later years. WE is an epic in the truest since of the word(with the length at 3 hours and 11 minutes)and you can feel the epic when your watching the film because WE is filled with beautiful shots of the Western land and everything in the film is bigger than life. Owen Roizman's beautiful Oscar nominated cinematography is just amazing and it gives WE an epic feel as well as dark and grim Film-Noir atmosphere especially during the night time scenes where we as the viewers see dark blue lighting that is wonderful to look at but very surreal and I think it adds to the film. While WE is wonderfully filmed the movie has a few if not many flaws. Despite being 3 hours plus WE feels uneven at times where some of the main characters come in and out with no explanation and none of the main characters with the exception of Wyatt Earp,Doc Holliday(Dennis Quaid) and Josie Marcus(Joanna Going) have depth. The friendship with Doc and relationship with Josephine are the only things in the film that are developed well and bring some life into the film. Also the relationship between Wyatt and his brothers Virgil Earp(Michael Madsen)and Morgan Earp(Linden Ashby) while good feels flat at times where you feel like that Wyatt Earp's brothers are not characters but cardboard cut outs that have no feeling or depth. I think one of the reasons Tombstone is a better film than WE is because it told a much better and clearer story and seems it knew what story it wanted to tell and in Tombstone the relationship between the Earp brothers is real and full of emotion and with WE you don't get that here. The famous Gunfight At The O.K Corell scene in WE while good feels like just regular and nothing special and when it happens it just ends where as the O.K Corell fight in Tombstone was more suspenseful and filled with tension and when you watch the gunfight in Tombstone you are on the edge of your seat and nervous when the guns start to go off. The ending of the film is good and epic and in someways adds to the Wyatt Earp legend and is a good cap off to this film. The whole cast does a great job. Kevin Costner does a wonderful job as Wyatt Earp,with Costner bringing optimism,sadness and grit to the role. Dennis Quaid gives a brilliant performance as Doc Holliday,with Quaid being gruff,aggressive and intense and has great scenes with Costner. The always great Gene Hackman is fantastic in his short role as Wyatt's Father Nicholas Earp and has a few wonderful scenes. Michael Madsen(Virgil Earp)and Linden Ashby(Morgan Earp)do fine jobs as Wyatt Earp's brothers. Bill Pullman and Tom Sizemore do wonderful jobs as lawmen Ed and Bat Masterson,friends of Wyatt Earp. Jeff Fahey(Ike Clanton)and Lewis Smith(Curly Bill Brocis)do great jobs as The Cowboys,the villains of the film. Joanna Going is amazing and beautiful as Josephine 'Josie' Marcus,Wyatt's love interest. Mark Harmon does a great job as Sheriff Behan,a corrupt sheriff and Josie's fianc&eacute;. Mare Winningham is just fantastic as Mattie Earp,Wyatt's wife. Also,lookout for small cast appearances from David Andrews(James Earp),Isabella Rossellini(Big Nose Kate),Catherine O'Hara(Allie Earp),JoBeth Williams(Bessie Earp),Rex Linn(Frank McLaury),Adam Baldwin(Tom McLaury),James Gammon(Mr Sutherland), Jim Caviezal(Warren Earp),Annabeth Gish(Urilla Sutherland),Tea Leoni(Sally),Mackenzie Astin(Francis O'Rourke)and Martin Kove(Ed Ross). The direction by Lawrence Kadsen is excellent,Kadsen always moving the camera and giving the film a big,epic feel giving a realistic look to the Western time period as well as a great visual style. Great direction by Kadsen. The score by James Newton Howard is just brilliant,epic,big and powerful and matches the epic,Western tone of the film. A beautiful score from Howard. In final word,if you love Westerns,The history of Wyatt Earp,Kevin Costner,Lawrence Kadsen or biopics,I recommend you see Wyatt Earp,a flawed,but wonderfully acted and beautifully filmed Western Epic that's not as good as Tombstone,but a good Western film in it's own right. Recommended. 8.5/10.

    Frankly, I have no idea why nearly all critics bashed this film, Wyatt Earp. This is another romantic western that goes on to tell the story of a famed lawman in the Old West and it is an effective story. Yes, it's a little bit too long but the time flew by fast. Some movies require this kind of length to tell a proper story. What I liked about this movie is that it had a great cast, great camera work, and best of all characters you come to know and fall in love with. Lawrence Kasdan's western epic is a biography on the lawman, Wyatt Earp who is famous for being hard-nosed and abides to the law by the book. This story tells of how he grew up with advice from his father to his times as lawman with his brothers. Kevin Costner, in the late 80's through mid 90's, has made plenty of great movies. Unfortunately, this movie started his downfall. That makes me sad because he was great in this as the guy who took no nonsense. I liked how Tom Sizemore and Michael Madsen played good guys because quite often they don't. I wanted more screen time for Gene Hackman because his few scenes were really powerful. Dennis Quaid was also really good as Doc Holliday, better than I expected Quaid to do. Overall, this is a really good western, better than what people give it credit for. After the success of Dance with Wolves and Unforgiven, I would think these kind of westerns would gain popularity. I guess that is not the case just yet. Even though this film clocks in at 3 hours and 10 minutes, I liked nearly every second of it. I rate this film 8/10.

    I agree with the review by Senator__Noc I think it is who states it is the most historically accurate and that Costner plays Earp like Earp was. I agree with the first part of that, it is the most historically accurate because of my readings about Earp and Tombstone, Arizona. You may like the film TOMBSTONE better than the film, Wyatt Earp, but this one is the most accurate. However, why not just see both of them and enjoy them for what they are. Some examples of historic accuracy: How gunfight was shown...just before it you see Morgan Earp and DoC walking together and one says to the other, "Let's get'em." This is straight out of a history quoting an eyewitness who heard that remark. Also, Wyatt's relationships with women. He was married to Aurelia in Missouri and she died. He did have a relationship with Mattie Blaylock and he did meet Josephine Marcus and they hooked up in Tombstone after Josephine had a relationship with John Behan. And John flashing a partially nude photo of Josephine is something that is written about in one history. I could go further but that is enough considering all the other reviews.

    Not that I'm obsessive but I managed to watch 3 versions of the OK Corral story in the last week  Wyatt Earp, Tombstone and My Darling Clementine. Wyatt Earp is easily the least impressive of the three though it's not without its merits. One of the truly awful things about this movie is the music. Never a scene goes by which isn't accompanied by the most tacky overblown orchestration to ever not grace a movie. The music and some of the more tacky scenes in the film actually make the film look more as though it should have been a TV mini-series where it would have been more acceptable. As a movie it's too long. Everything leading up to the death of Earp's first wife is superfluous. Yes it's good to see Gene Hackman giving another great performance but it wasn't necessary. We just needed to know that she died and Earp didn't get over it to understand some of his motivations. The final section when Earp is older is also unnecessary and adds to the TV mini-series quality of the enterprise. In the middle we have something better. Costner isn't the best actor in the world but he isn't the worst either. He does a decent solid job of playing this part. All the supporting actors do a decent job too but neither Costner or any of the other players are as good and as believable as their counterparts in Tombstone. Dennis Quaid gives the best performance in the film though even he can't match Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday in Tombstone. So a decent enough film but never rises above the level of a TV movie.

    Wyatt Earp is a semi-biographical Western film that is written by Dan Gordon and Lawrence Kasdan. Directed by Lawrence Kasdan, this epic version of the legendary western sheriff-gunslinger's life story stars Kevin Costner in the title role as Wyatt Earp, who lived from 1848 to 1929.It also includes an ensemble cast that includes Dennis Quaid, Gene Hackman, Isabella Rossellini, Mark Harmon, Michael Madsen, Joanna Going, Tom Sizemore, Bill Pullman, JoBeth Williams, Linden Ashby, and Mare Winningham. Growing up on a farm in Iowa, Earp tries to run away to join the Union Army in the Civil War, but he is turned away because of his youth. Instead, he studies law and marries Urilla Sutherland. But Urilla dies of typhoid fever before they can have children. Earp grows despondent and descends into drinking and petty thievery, but his father Nicholas finds him, sobers him up, and sets him straight. Earp becomes a buffalo hunter and a close companion of Bat Masterson and his brother Ed. With his brothers, Virgil and Morgan, Earp sets out to clean up the violence- plagued towns of the old West by using his own guns to settle scores. Earp takes up with Mattie Blaylock, a drug addict and prostitute, then discards her for actress Josie Marcus. In Tombstone, Arizona, the Earp brothers and their comrade Doc Holliday, who is plagued by tuberculosis and a compulsion for gambling, meet their match in a ruthless gang led by Ike Clanton. This massive, in-depth study of the dark Western icon comes off with mixed results. Trying to capture the whole life, of the lawman-criminal- brother-fortune hunter, director Lawrence Kasdan gains points for sheer scale, giving us a rich epic painted in dark colors with gritty settings. But the visual poetry and extensive foreshadowing ruin the dramatic drive. Some scenes have as much impact as stalker movies; you're just waiting for someone to get knocked off. As Earp, Kevin Costner is not afraid to look rumpled and play colorlessly, but it saps the energy of this 3-hour-plus film. Best is the first half, with Costner, as hip as he was in his Silverado days, going through a series of ups and downs until he accidentally finds his profession. Great set design utilizes dozens of similar settings that always look distinctive. Recommended to fans of the star and the genre, but the story never justifies its length.But nevertheless,it is beautifully shot and impressively directed, it's an ambitious Western in the classic mold, the kind of film that rarely gets made anymore.
