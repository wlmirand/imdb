    "Spy Hard" is non-stop belly laughs from beginning to end! There is so much to love about this comedy! (Besides "Dracula, Dead and Loving It," this is our favorite film starring Leslie Nelsen!) This is one of the few comedies we watch again and again and we always seem to catch something we've never noticed before! Charles Durning and Barry Boswick co-star and are hilarious! (Barry's New England accent is beyond funny!) Wonderful Andy Griffith as the evil enemy is fantastic! He is ever-so creepy - and funny! John Ales (as Kabul) is great! The story and editing is clever and fast-paced. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie! P.S. Check out Agent WD-40's (Leslie Nielsen) great wall of photos in his living room; he is pictured as working security with many famous and historical people! Just another hilarious moment in this awesome comedy! P.P.S. LOVE Weird Al's theme - what a great way to open and close this classic comedy! Weird Al has the PERFECT sense of humor to set the stage for this hilarious film!

    Some movie director's make spoofs on real movies and some just make ripoff's of those spoofs. This is one of the latter. I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson. But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

    Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags. He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out. However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss. Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

    General Rancor (Andy Griffith) is threatening to destroy the world with a missile he is hiding at his secret base. But to complete his goal, he needs a special computer chip, invented by Prof. Ukrinsky. Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) is assigned to the case, in order to prevent the worst. The humor of this film is similar to other Nielsen flicks -- slapstick, cheesy and sometimes downright stupid. It is a far many rungs down the ladder from "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun", though still a step up from "Dracula Dead and Loving It" (with all due respect to Mel Brooks). While there are many funny moments, something about it seems cheap and many of the movie parodies are just not well done. The "Home Alone" parody is overdone, and so is the "Sister Act" bit, whereas "Speed" and "Jurassic Park" may have been just right. Special credit goes to Pat Morita for playing Brian the gay waiter. It may be a bit part, but it was a good bit part.

    "Spy Hard" Had Its Funny Moments, But Should Not Have Spied So Hard

    "Spy Hard" can easily be misconceived as a film by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team who brought us "Airplane" (1980), "The Naked Gun" (1988), and its sequels. Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by "Weird Al" Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films: laughs. Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities. When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, "No Dick can stop me", which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early. The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award. There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films. The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to "GoldenEye" (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from "Cliffhanger" (1993), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Home Alone" (1990), "Apollo 13" (1995), "Speed" (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from "Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid" (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern. Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the "Speed" spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in "Pulp Fiction", and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, "Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it." I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called "SPY Hard" should be doing. The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

    Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as "WD-40" to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world. Sexy and snuggly-clothed Nicollette Sheridan (as Veronique Ukrinsky) is Dick's arousing co-spy, and accented John Ales (as Kabul) is a reliable partner. "Weird Al" Yankovic gets things of to a good start with a "Goldfinger" licking good title song. Familiar faces and comic bits keep it fun, through most of the running time. ****** Spy Hard (5/24/96) Rick Friedberg ~ Leslie Nielsen, Nicollette Sheridan, John Ales, Andy Griffith

    Written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer(talentless hacks as far as I am concerned) and directed by Rick Friedberg, even with the major flaws Spy Hard is not a bad movie. I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable. So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy. But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing. That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001:A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio. Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    If the names Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't ring a bell, perhaps their directorial efforts for films such as Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie may be more familiar with just how consistently bad they were, following a rote formula of making fun of genre film franchises that somehow wasn't really funny, with more misses than hits with their gags. That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not. But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record. I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why "Dick Steel" was a handle I used - dropping the last "e" in Steele for more "bite" during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods. Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

    I would have to say that Spy Hard is a terrible movie that tries too hard to be something like Airplane and they also copied some jokes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,the only seen I really found funny was the opening title sung by Weird Al Yankovic. A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    spy hard is a funny spoof starring laugh master leslie nielsen and while it's not as funny as his police squad works it has some great laughs none the less, there is virtually no plot just gag after gag, some fail, but most work, thankfuly its short running time doesn't let it get repetitive. we all know what to expect from a leslie nielsen movie and spy hard delivers the usaul dose of leslie nielsen type comedy, sure its of a certain taste but trust me when your in the mood, they deliver the goods. spy hard is a decent comedy and has enough laughs but trust me its no classic, but if your a leslie nielsen fan as i am, then it's definitely one for the collection.

The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

    Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as "WD-40" to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world. Sexy and snuggly-clothed Nicollette Sheridan (as Veronique Ukrinsky) is Dick's arousing co-spy, and accented John Ales (as Kabul) is a reliable partner. "Weird Al" Yankovic gets things of to a good start with a "Goldfinger" licking good title song. Familiar faces and comic bits keep it fun, through most of the running time. ****** Spy Hard (5/24/96) Rick Friedberg ~ Leslie Nielsen, Nicollette Sheridan, John Ales, Andy Griffith

    Written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer(talentless hacks as far as I am concerned) and directed by Rick Friedberg, even with the major flaws Spy Hard is not a bad movie. I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable. So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy. But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing. That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001:A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio. Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    If the names Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't ring a bell, perhaps their directorial efforts for films such as Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie may be more familiar with just how consistently bad they were, following a rote formula of making fun of genre film franchises that somehow wasn't really funny, with more misses than hits with their gags. That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not. But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record. I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why "Dick Steel" was a handle I used - dropping the last "e" in Steele for more "bite" during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods. Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    "Spy Hard" is non-stop belly laughs from beginning to end! There is so much to love about this comedy! (Besides "Dracula, Dead and Loving It," this is our favorite film starring Leslie Nelsen!) This is one of the few comedies we watch again and again and we always seem to catch something we've never noticed before! Charles Durning and Barry Boswick co-star and are hilarious! (Barry's New England accent is beyond funny!) Wonderful Andy Griffith as the evil enemy is fantastic! He is ever-so creepy - and funny! John Ales (as Kabul) is great! The story and editing is clever and fast-paced. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie! P.S. Check out Agent WD-40's (Leslie Nielsen) great wall of photos in his living room; he is pictured as working security with many famous and historical people! Just another hilarious moment in this awesome comedy! P.P.S. LOVE Weird Al's theme - what a great way to open and close this classic comedy! Weird Al has the PERFECT sense of humor to set the stage for this hilarious film!

    Some movie director's make spoofs on real movies and some just make ripoff's of those spoofs. This is one of the latter. I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson. But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

    Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags. He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out. However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss. Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

    General Rancor (Andy Griffith) is threatening to destroy the world with a missile he is hiding at his secret base. But to complete his goal, he needs a special computer chip, invented by Prof. Ukrinsky. Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) is assigned to the case, in order to prevent the worst. The humor of this film is similar to other Nielsen flicks -- slapstick, cheesy and sometimes downright stupid. It is a far many rungs down the ladder from "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun", though still a step up from "Dracula Dead and Loving It" (with all due respect to Mel Brooks). While there are many funny moments, something about it seems cheap and many of the movie parodies are just not well done. The "Home Alone" parody is overdone, and so is the "Sister Act" bit, whereas "Speed" and "Jurassic Park" may have been just right. Special credit goes to Pat Morita for playing Brian the gay waiter. It may be a bit part, but it was a good bit part.

    "Spy Hard" Had Its Funny Moments, But Should Not Have Spied So Hard

    "Spy Hard" can easily be misconceived as a film by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team who brought us "Airplane" (1980), "The Naked Gun" (1988), and its sequels. Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by "Weird Al" Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films: laughs. Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities. When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, "No Dick can stop me", which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early. The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award. There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films. The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to "GoldenEye" (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from "Cliffhanger" (1993), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Home Alone" (1990), "Apollo 13" (1995), "Speed" (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from "Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid" (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern. Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the "Speed" spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in "Pulp Fiction", and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, "Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it." I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called "SPY Hard" should be doing. The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually.

    Some movie director's make spoofs on real movies and some just make ripoff's of those spoofs. This is one of the latter. I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson. But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

    Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags. He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out. However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss. Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

    General Rancor (Andy Griffith) is threatening to destroy the world with a missile he is hiding at his secret base. But to complete his goal, he needs a special computer chip, invented by Prof. Ukrinsky. Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) is assigned to the case, in order to prevent the worst. The humor of this film is similar to other Nielsen flicks -- slapstick, cheesy and sometimes downright stupid. It is a far many rungs down the ladder from "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun", though still a step up from "Dracula Dead and Loving It" (with all due respect to Mel Brooks). While there are many funny moments, something about it seems cheap and many of the movie parodies are just not well done. The "Home Alone" parody is overdone, and so is the "Sister Act" bit, whereas "Speed" and "Jurassic Park" may have been just right. Special credit goes to Pat Morita for playing Brian the gay waiter. It may be a bit part, but it was a good bit part.

    "Spy Hard" Had Its Funny Moments, But Should Not Have Spied So Hard

    "Spy Hard" can easily be misconceived as a film by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team who brought us "Airplane" (1980), "The Naked Gun" (1988), and its sequels. Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by "Weird Al" Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films: laughs. Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities. When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, "No Dick can stop me", which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early. The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award. There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films. The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to "GoldenEye" (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from "Cliffhanger" (1993), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Home Alone" (1990), "Apollo 13" (1995), "Speed" (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from "Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid" (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern. Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the "Speed" spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in "Pulp Fiction", and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, "Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it." I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called "SPY Hard" should be doing. The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

    Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as "WD-40" to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world. Sexy and snuggly-clothed Nicollette Sheridan (as Veronique Ukrinsky) is Dick's arousing co-spy, and accented John Ales (as Kabul) is a reliable partner. "Weird Al" Yankovic gets things of to a good start with a "Goldfinger" licking good title song. Familiar faces and comic bits keep it fun, through most of the running time. ****** Spy Hard (5/24/96) Rick Friedberg ~ Leslie Nielsen, Nicollette Sheridan, John Ales, Andy Griffith

    Written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer(talentless hacks as far as I am concerned) and directed by Rick Friedberg, even with the major flaws Spy Hard is not a bad movie. I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable. So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy. But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing. That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001:A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio. Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    If the names Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't ring a bell, perhaps their directorial efforts for films such as Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie may be more familiar with just how consistently bad they were, following a rote formula of making fun of genre film franchises that somehow wasn't really funny, with more misses than hits with their gags. That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not. But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record. I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why "Dick Steel" was a handle I used - dropping the last "e" in Steele for more "bite" during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods. Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

    I would have to say that Spy Hard is a terrible movie that tries too hard to be something like Airplane and they also copied some jokes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,the only seen I really found funny was the opening title sung by Weird Al Yankovic. A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    spy hard is a funny spoof starring laugh master leslie nielsen and while it's not as funny as his police squad works it has some great laughs none the less, there is virtually no plot just gag after gag, some fail, but most work, thankfuly its short running time doesn't let it get repetitive. we all know what to expect from a leslie nielsen movie and spy hard delivers the usaul dose of leslie nielsen type comedy, sure its of a certain taste but trust me when your in the mood, they deliver the goods. spy hard is a decent comedy and has enough laughs but trust me its no classic, but if your a leslie nielsen fan as i am, then it's definitely one for the collection.

    "Spy Hard" is non-stop belly laughs from beginning to end! There is so much to love about this comedy! (Besides "Dracula, Dead and Loving It," this is our favorite film starring Leslie Nelsen!) This is one of the few comedies we watch again and again and we always seem to catch something we've never noticed before! Charles Durning and Barry Boswick co-star and are hilarious! (Barry's New England accent is beyond funny!) Wonderful Andy Griffith as the evil enemy is fantastic! He is ever-so creepy - and funny! John Ales (as Kabul) is great! The story and editing is clever and fast-paced. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie! P.S. Check out Agent WD-40's (Leslie Nielsen) great wall of photos in his living room; he is pictured as working security with many famous and historical people! Just another hilarious moment in this awesome comedy! P.P.S. LOVE Weird Al's theme - what a great way to open and close this classic comedy!

But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing. That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001:A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio. Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    If the names Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't ring a bell, perhaps their directorial efforts for films such as Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie may be more familiar with just how consistently bad they were, following a rote formula of making fun of genre film franchises that somehow wasn't really funny, with more misses than hits with their gags. That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not. But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record. I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why "Dick Steel" was a handle I used - dropping the last "e" in Steele for more "bite" during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods. Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

    I would have to say that Spy Hard is a terrible movie that tries too hard to be something like Airplane and they also copied some jokes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,the only seen I really found funny was the opening title sung by Weird Al Yankovic. A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    spy hard is a funny spoof starring laugh master leslie nielsen and while it's not as funny as his police squad works it has some great laughs none the less, there is virtually no plot just gag after gag, some fail, but most work, thankfuly its short running time doesn't let it get repetitive. we all know what to expect from a leslie nielsen movie and spy hard delivers the usaul dose of leslie nielsen type comedy, sure its of a certain taste but trust me when your in the mood, they deliver the goods. spy hard is a decent comedy and has enough laughs but trust me its no classic, but if your a leslie nielsen fan as i am, then it's definitely one for the collection.

    "Spy Hard" is non-stop belly laughs from beginning to end! There is so much to love about this comedy! (Besides "Dracula, Dead and Loving It," this is our favorite film starring Leslie Nelsen!) This is one of the few comedies we watch again and again and we always seem to catch something we've never noticed before! Charles Durning and Barry Boswick co-star and are hilarious! (Barry's New England accent is beyond funny!) Wonderful Andy Griffith as the evil enemy is fantastic! He is ever-so creepy - and funny! John Ales (as Kabul) is great! The story and editing is clever and fast-paced. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie! P.S. Check out Agent WD-40's (Leslie Nielsen) great wall of photos in his living room; he is pictured as working security with many famous and historical people! Just another hilarious moment in this awesome comedy! P.P.S. LOVE Weird Al's theme - what a great way to open and close this classic comedy! Weird Al has the PERFECT sense of humor to set the stage for this hilarious film!

    Some movie director's make spoofs on real movies and some just make ripoff's of those spoofs. This is one of the latter. I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson. But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

    Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags. He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out. However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss. Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

    General Rancor (Andy Griffith) is threatening to destroy the world with a missile he is hiding at his secret base. But to complete his goal, he needs a special computer chip, invented by Prof. Ukrinsky. Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) is assigned to the case, in order to prevent the worst. The humor of this film is similar to other Nielsen flicks -- slapstick, cheesy and sometimes downright stupid. It is a far many rungs down the ladder from "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun", though still a step up from "Dracula Dead and Loving It" (with all due respect to Mel Brooks). While there are many funny moments, something about it seems cheap and many of the movie parodies are just not well done. The "Home Alone" parody is overdone, and so is the "Sister Act" bit, whereas "Speed" and "Jurassic Park" may have been just right. Special credit goes to Pat Morita for playing Brian the gay waiter. It may be a bit part, but it was a good bit part.

    "Spy Hard" Had Its Funny Moments, But Should Not Have Spied So Hard

    "Spy Hard" can easily be misconceived as a film by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team who brought us "Airplane" (1980), "The Naked Gun" (1988), and its sequels. Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by "Weird Al" Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films: laughs. Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities. When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, "No Dick can stop me", which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early. The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award. There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films. The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to "GoldenEye" (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from "Cliffhanger" (1993), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Home Alone" (1990), "Apollo 13" (1995), "Speed" (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from "Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid" (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern. Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the "Speed" spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in "Pulp Fiction", and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, "Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it." I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called "SPY Hard" should be doing. The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

    Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as "WD-40" to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world. Sexy and snuggly-clothed Nicollette Sheridan (as Veronique Ukrinsky) is Dick's arousing co-spy, and accented John Ales (as Kabul) is a reliable partner. "Weird Al" Yankovic gets things of to a good start with a "Goldfinger" licking good title song. Familiar faces and comic bits keep it fun, through most of the running time. ****** Spy Hard (5/24/96) Rick Friedberg ~ Leslie Nielsen, Nicollette Sheridan, John Ales, Andy Griffith

    Written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer(talentless hacks as far as I am concerned) and directed by Rick Friedberg, even with the major flaws Spy Hard is not a bad movie. I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable. So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy.

    General Rancor (Andy Griffith) is threatening to destroy the world with a missile he is hiding at his secret base. But to complete his goal, he needs a special computer chip, invented by Prof. Ukrinsky. Special Agent Dick Steele (Leslie Nielsen) is assigned to the case, in order to prevent the worst. The humor of this film is similar to other Nielsen flicks -- slapstick, cheesy and sometimes downright stupid. It is a far many rungs down the ladder from "Airplane!" or "Naked Gun", though still a step up from "Dracula Dead and Loving It" (with all due respect to Mel Brooks). While there are many funny moments, something about it seems cheap and many of the movie parodies are just not well done. The "Home Alone" parody is overdone, and so is the "Sister Act" bit, whereas "Speed" and "Jurassic Park" may have been just right. Special credit goes to Pat Morita for playing Brian the gay waiter. It may be a bit part, but it was a good bit part.

    "Spy Hard" Had Its Funny Moments, But Should Not Have Spied So Hard

    "Spy Hard" can easily be misconceived as a film by the Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker team who brought us "Airplane" (1980), "The Naked Gun" (1988), and its sequels. Their signature gags-per-minute style of on-screen jokes is very evident here, not to mention Leslie Nielsen's starring role and a cameo by "Weird Al" Yankovic. However, this film is mainly missing what Zucker-Abrahams-Zucker usually include in their previous films: laughs. Actually, there are a few funny moments, but the rest of the movie seems to try too hard to be funny. The films references to popular, but non-spy, movies from that era (approximately 1992-1996) also feel out of place most of the time, and contribute nothing to the story. Leslie Nielsen still brings his trademark deadpan sensibilities to the role of special agent Dick Steele, but the rest of the film is weighed down by gags that are way too obvious, character names that serve as an all too desperate attempt to fish laughs from the audience (Dick Steele being a great example, and yes, there are penis jokes associated with that name), and missed opportunities. When I say missed opportunities, I'm talking mainly about Andy Griffith's role as terrorist General Rancor. To me, it's funny that American's quintessential nice guy would play the villain in this movie. However, that irony is never capitalized upon at any point when Griffith is on the screen. Because his character had his arms blown off, there are dumb running gags about his mechanical prosthetics. There's also a scene where he says, "No Dick can stop me", which seems too open an invitation for a phallic joke. Sure enough, that joke arrives unfashionably early. The equally dumb names continue with the many femme fatales, beginning with Dick Steele's previous partner in crime, agent Barbara Dahl (Barbie Doll. Ho ho ho!). The worst was Miss Cheevus, played by Marcia Gay Harden years before winning an Academy Award. There's nothing really wrong with the story. A federal agent tries to stop a madman terrorist from taking over the world. I can get behind that. I mean, this terrorist wants to take over the world, but doesn't seem to know what he's going to do with it afterwards. Well, neither do terrorists in more serious-toned films. The problem lay in the story being weighed down by way too many movie references, none of which had to do with the plot or with spy films in general. For instance, there are ironically no references to "GoldenEye" (1995), the James Bond film that came out months before. There are, however, famous scenes repeated from "Cliffhanger" (1993), "Pulp Fiction" (1994), "Home Alone" (1990), "Apollo 13" (1995), "Speed" (1994), and the famous Paul Newman bike-riding scene from "Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid" (1968). The latter reference came out of left field and broke the pattern. Still, with the exception of Ray Charles as a bus driver during the "Speed" spoof, all the other parody scenes were not funny. They were also barely parodies because they didn't point out the irony of their respective iconic moments. Leslie Nielsen and Nicollette Sheridan dance the exact same way John Travolta and Uma Thurman did in "Pulp Fiction", and to the exact same song. But that was it. It's almost as if the filmmakers' thought, "Hey, 'Pulp Fiction' was popular a few years ago. Let's throw in this scene from it." I could rant about Nielsen's agent number being WD-40, and how just having the name of a waterproof spray does not a funny gag make. Still, it at least tried to make fun of spy movies, which is what a film called "SPY Hard" should be doing. The fault here lies in the writing, particularly contributions by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer. If these names sound familiar, they belong to two writers who would go on to ruin the credibility of "Scary Movie", which they helped co-write, by making "Date Movie" (2006), "Epic Movie" (2007), "Meet The Spartans", "Disaster Movie" (both 2008), and "Vampires Suck" (2010). Those latter films ruined the parody genre, and are even more guilty of pop culture referencing without actual humor than this movie is. Their contributions to this movie probably resulted in it being worse than it could have been. Fortunately, of the many cameos, "Weird Al" Yankovic made the most of his appearance. His song, "Spy Hard", was an incredibly funny send-up of James Bond themes from Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger" to Tom Jones' "Thunderball", both lyrically and visually. It's just too bad that the rest of the film couldn't keep up, as hard as it may have spied.

    Promiscuous secret agent Leslie Nielsen (as Dick Steele) comes out of retirement and assumes his spy identity as "WD-40" to battle old enemy Andy Griffith (as Rancor), made-up to look like Leonid Brezhnev and aiming to take over the entire free world. Sexy and snuggly-clothed Nicollette Sheridan (as Veronique Ukrinsky) is Dick's arousing co-spy, and accented John Ales (as Kabul) is a reliable partner. "Weird Al" Yankovic gets things of to a good start with a "Goldfinger" licking good title song. Familiar faces and comic bits keep it fun, through most of the running time. ****** Spy Hard (5/24/96) Rick Friedberg ~ Leslie Nielsen, Nicollette Sheridan, John Ales, Andy Griffith

    Written by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer(talentless hacks as far as I am concerned) and directed by Rick Friedberg, even with the major flaws Spy Hard is not a bad movie. I will admit I was expecting it to be a lot worse, you see Friedberg and Seltzer directed Disaster Movie and Epic Movie which are two of the worst movies ever made, Meet the Spartans which fares little better and Date Movie and Vampires Suck while lame was the best of the lot(I have to re watch the Scary Movie flicks). So I was expecting something unwatchable. So I was surprised at how moderately entertaining Spy Hard was. It does have its problems I agree. The story is predictable and rather rushed in the pace not helped by its scant length. The direction is also not the best, sometimes it is efficient but at other times it is patchy. But the worst part of Spy Hard is the juvenile and often unfunny dialogue which shows Friedberg and Seltzer's weaknesses for writing as well as directing. That said, despite the bad dialogue at times, there are some funny sight gags and the references to the spy genre weren't too obvious and fun to spot. The film doesn't look like direct-to-video fodder either, which is a good thing. The editing mayn't be the best, but when it comes to the sets, costumes, gadgetry and some of the photography it is pretty spot on. The soundtrack is reminiscent in style to a James Bond outing such as For Your Eyes Only, and while I am not a fan of that particular score the music was fun to listen to here and I liked its style. The acting compared to any of the films Friedberg and Seltzer directed is pretty good, Leslie Nielson is great when funny and he is rather here with a fun enough character. This performance is far from his best such as Airplane and Naked Gun, but at least he didn't embarrass himself as badly as he did when he did 2001:A Space Travesty. Charles Durning and Nicolette Sheridan are decent too and there are some interesting cameos from Robert Culp and Fabio. Overall, surprisingly watchable compared to the clap-trap I was expecting. 6/10 Bethany Cox

    If the names Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer don't ring a bell, perhaps their directorial efforts for films such as Vampires Suck, Disaster Movie, Meet the Spartans, Epic Movie and Date Movie may be more familiar with just how consistently bad they were, following a rote formula of making fun of genre film franchises that somehow wasn't really funny, with more misses than hits with their gags. That formula also states to chalk up a long list of impersonators and to lampoon everything that's pop culture at the moment, and to string a series of bad gags to make up what's essentially some semblance of a story, not. But it wasn't all that bad to begin with. Early in their career they're responsible for writing the Scary Movie franchise, and made their debut with writing Spy Hard, a film that starred the late Leslie Nielsen, and I suppose back then there was enough budget for the filmmakers to hire bona fide stars such as Ray Charles, Hulk Hogan, the male model Fabio, Mr T and even the late Pat Morita of Karate Kid's Mr Miyagi fame, before the flops spell out the hiring of impersonators (no offense to the profession) since I would believe the stars wouldn't want to go touch these productions with a ten foot pole given a regressing track record. I've always associated Leslie Nielsen with his better known Naked Gun series, and while his brand of comedy had gone beyond detective Frank Drebin, somehow Nielsen is quite the enigma, and becomes a character in his own right no matter what role he gets to play. Cue the signature blank stares, the innuendos and the physical slapstick comedy that he's perfected, that you'll know you're in for a hoot no matter how bad the story is. Here his Agent WD-40 aka Dick Steele (OK, so here's the cat out of the bag for friends who wonder why "Dick Steel" was a handle I used - dropping the last "e" in Steele for more "bite" during my online gaming days) is the quintessential spoof-Bond, with mysterious charisma and suave to win over the femme fatales, and gets the job done with questionable, unorthodox methods. Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

    I would have to say that Spy Hard is a terrible movie that tries too hard to be something like Airplane and they also copied some jokes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,the only seen I really found funny was the opening title sung by Weird Al Yankovic. A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    spy hard is a funny spoof starring laugh master leslie nielsen and while it's not as funny as his police squad works it has some great laughs none the less, there is virtually no plot just gag after gag, some fail, but most work, thankfuly its short running time doesn't let it get repetitive. we all know what to expect from a leslie nielsen movie and spy hard delivers the usaul dose of leslie nielsen type comedy, sure its of a certain taste but trust me when your in the mood, they deliver the goods. spy hard is a decent comedy and has enough laughs but trust me its no classic, but if your a leslie nielsen fan as i am, then it's definitely one for the collection.

    "Spy Hard" is non-stop belly laughs from beginning to end! There is so much to love about this comedy! (Besides "Dracula, Dead and Loving It," this is our favorite film starring Leslie Nelsen!) This is one of the few comedies we watch again and again and we always seem to catch something we've never noticed before! Charles Durning and Barry Boswick co-star and are hilarious! (Barry's New England accent is beyond funny!) Wonderful Andy Griffith as the evil enemy is fantastic! He is ever-so creepy - and funny! John Ales (as Kabul) is great! The story and editing is clever and fast-paced. There isn't a dull moment in the entire movie! P.S. Check out Agent WD-40's (Leslie Nielsen) great wall of photos in his living room; he is pictured as working security with many famous and historical people! Just another hilarious moment in this awesome comedy! P.P.S. LOVE Weird Al's theme - what a great way to open and close this classic comedy! Weird Al has the PERFECT sense of humor to set the stage for this hilarious film!

    Some movie director's make spoofs on real movies and some just make ripoff's of those spoofs. This is one of the latter. I popped this in because i, like many of the people who watched the Naked gun series (and Airplane and Scary Movies) loved the way the Zucker Abrams director team made incredible comedy with Leslie Nielson. But this movie was directed by entirely different people, who had no qualms about totally ripping off those comic geniuses and what's more egregious- failing to be funny! Just don't waste your time- there are still plenty of great comedies with outrageous Leslie Nielson playing the same exact character that are actually bearable to watch. Unfortunately this is not one of them.

    Yes, you do have to enjoy Leslie Nielson - and millions do - and I am one of them and whilst they're always funny and enjoyable, they do repeat quite obvious gags. He (& the production team) do those very well, of course and Nielson's sense of comic timing spot-on. However, this parody on the James Bond's and Spies of the cinematic world is seldom original. The funniest bits tend to be the gags away from those obviously 'Spy' genre and there's much sending up of films such as Home Alone, Speed, Pulp Fiction, True Lies, Sister Act, Jurassic Park, In the Line of Duty and finally a classic 007 fight-out. However, most of these are just too similar to the originals to be anything more than amusingly recognisable. I'm not saying that they're any better or worse than the Scary Movies send up's of horror flicks, but they could do better; mind you, I never thought I'd see the day Nielson takes the John Travolta role, grey hair in a ponytail, in the infamous dance with Uma Thurman from Pulp Fiction. As always, the Silver haired charmer gets the most unlikely of gorgeous ladies and as always these are great value as their ridiculousness are always so well spoofed up. As Dick Steele, (Agent WD40) Nielsen is suitably inept and takes the praise that others create around him, whilst he wreaks havoc. There's a great cameo from Ray Charles as a blind bus driver in the Speed sketch and Charles Durning contributes a large slice of humour as 'The Director', Steele's boss. Leslie Nielsen, RIP - Spy Hard was not his finest film, not a bad one, but alas, not a very good one, which is down to the material, not the great man himself.

Yes, I suppose one of the easiest way to spoof a film or a franchise is to set the sights on James Bond. After all, we have Johnny English and Austin Powers to come after this, so there's plenty of room actually for more of such wannabes who have their equivalent of a theme song, here performed in hilarious fashion and easily one of the best sequences here with a Weird Al Yankovic contribution full of inane lyrics, and keep a close eye on those gyrating silhouettes! Like all "comedic" films by Jason Friedberg and Aaron Seltzer to follow this, Spy Hard is the precursor to their idea that comedy stems from poking fun at the box office successes of the time, and in the mid 90s, we get spoofs here from films such as Jan de Bont's Speed, Spielberg's Jurassic Park, Tarantino's Pulp Fiction, Cameron's True Lies, Wolfgang Petersen's In the Line of Fire and even Sister Act which allowed for some nuns with guns moments. While it's part of the fun spotting, or rather identify all the blatant spoof attempts, this soon wears out their welcome and like their follow up films, it seems that lessons aren't learnt from spoof fatigue. Simply put the story here dwells on Agent WD-40 stopping his arch nemesis General Rancor (Andy Griffith, or TV's Matlock), but its relentless buffoonery didn't quite survive past the halfway mark where jokes consistently fell flat and were unfunny. Still, the best thing about the film is to watch Leslie Nielsen at his element with yet another Nielsen-isque performance, and for fans around the world, he will definitely be missed as one of the unlikeliest comedians of our generation. Rest in peace, and thank you for the memories.

    Tries "too hard" to be something like Airplane and copies a lot of scenes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,

    I would have to say that Spy Hard is a terrible movie that tries too hard to be something like Airplane and they also copied some jokes from it and the whole film is pretty much a bad prequel to The Naked Gun,the only seen I really found funny was the opening title sung by Weird Al Yankovic. A spy spoof starring Leslie Nielson and Nicolette Sheridan,Secret Agent Dick Steele (aka wd-40)has retired from the spy business and spends his life lately just playing golf and having *** with women younger than him but he has to go back when he has to stop his nemesis,the evil General Rancor.

    spy hard is a funny spoof starring laugh master leslie nielsen and while it's not as funny as his police squad works it has some great laughs none the less, there is virtually no plot just gag after gag, some fail, but most work, thankfuly its short running time doesn't let it get repetitive. we all know what to expect from a leslie nielsen movie and spy hard delivers the usaul dose of leslie nielsen type comedy, sure its of a certain taste but trust me when your in the mood, they deliver the goods. spy hard is a decent comedy and has enough laughs but trust me its no classic, but if your a leslie nielsen fan as i am, then it's definitely one for the collection.
