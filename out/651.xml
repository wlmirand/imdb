    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.

    I just came on to this page to comment on GLORY and noticed that it had dropped out of the IMDb list of top 250 films which isn't something that upsets me too much . I saw it once many years ago and my abiding memory of it was it contained some very impressive battle scenes but the rest of it was " Hollywood History " complete with historical relativism that was viewed with 20th Century eyes . Seeing it again my initial instincts were confirmed We get a pre title caption stating Robert Gould Shaw was 23 years old when he enlisted in to the Union Army and regularly wrote to his parents telling them of life in the Army of Potomac . The story then revolves around the 54th Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry , the first unit of the US army to be composed of black men . So far so good but you're left with the feeling that screenwriter Kevin Jarre browsed through Colonel Shaw's letters he wrote back home and then invented his own characters and situations . I've not read any of Shaw's letters so can't contradict what may or may not have happened but not for one moment did I get the impression I was watching characters from mid 19th Century America . In fact I found the characters totally stereotypical and one note such as the stammering black man , the bolshie black man , the intelligent black man and of course when a bunch of black men get together they've got perfect singing voices down to natural rhythm . By having a rather patronisingly liberal view of 19th Century blacks one can't help thinking the film is in danger of offensive on the grounds of inverse racism as much as overt racism would be . Didn't these characters have minds of their own , opinions of their own ? There's also a distinct lack of politics but I guess if you're making a film about a war to end slavery in America it's a bad idea to mention politics . I mean Lyndon B Johnson probably did more for Black America than all the previous American Presidents combined Most of the cast rise above the rather mediocre material . Denzil Washington probably gives a career best performance and of course any movie featuring Morgan Freeman is worth watching . The problem is that these good performances show up Matthew Broderick as being out of his depth and he seems to spend most of the film with a perplexed look on his face but this might be understandable since the film feels more 20th Century than 19th and he possibly thinks he's a time traveler . That said the battle scenes remain quite well done and deserve credit , not least because the rest of the film is so anachronistic in feel the temptation to have a fleet of Huey helicopter gunships dropping napalm might have remained a possibility

    Ever since D.W. Griffith's infamous "Birth of a Nation", a film like "Glory" was long overdue to re-establish the truth and do justice to those who fought for freedom and equality. , "Glory" focuses on Afro-Americans like films of the same year such as "Do the Right Thing" or "Driving Miss Daisy" but I disagreed with Ebert's comment that the story needed to be from the soldiers' perspective, because the film is less about race than the triumph of willingness through action. Women didn't vote for instance, but that was because voting has always been a privilege for those who defended the city: men fought in the army, not women. Duties give privileges and black soldiers chose to fight, aware that their blood would trace the road to liberty and equality, under the leadership of Col. Robert Gould Shaw, played by Matthew Broderick in a breakthrough dramatic role. There's one powerful moment near the end when Shaw is about to give the signal for the historical attack on Fort Wagner. He looks at the sea with sadness in his eyes but a growing exhilaration in his heart. Shaw knows he and the main body of his troops are going to fall, but he also knows that the 54th Massachusetts, the first Regiment of Black soldiers, had to volunteer for what seemed like a suicidal mission. And when the whole unit advances toward the sea, it's a true march to history and the infinite horizon resonates like the invaluable impact their action will have on the course of the war, and on the Destiny of America. And that is the true meaning of the film, men dying in a blaze of "Glory", for one's death can bring so much for the future generations' lives: abolition of slavery, freedom, dignity, in others words: a just cause. Providing the viewers the capability to understand what goes through a character's mind without any word spoken is certainly the mark of great movies and "Glory", directed by a relatively unknown Edward Zwyck, is one of them. And the credit goes to the cast, beyond Matthew Broderick whose boyish looks convey the insecurity of a young Colonel who is given a heavy share of America's fate on his hands, there are Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington (and God, what fitting names for such a film), in performances that leave no doubt about their future as the most dependable actors of the next decades. And their characters allow us to value the accomplishment of the 54th Massachusetts, that became an inspiration for all the Afro-Americans through its heroism, determination, and resistance to the many obstacles that obstructed the road to glory, like the racism that was also prevailing in the North camp, to start with, and that severely damaged the motivation of the first enlistees. And recurring moments when they meet in the tent provide the necessary level of intimacy to understand what goes through their hearts and that they will never show to the whites, it also intelligently reinforces the idea that 'black' is not just a generic term or a monolithic group. They're not all wise or good-hearted, gentle or dim-witted, one of them is Thomas, a friend of Shaw, the son of a free man from Boston, highly educated and intelligent, even a bit snobbish. Freeman is a gravedigger, a man of a few words but each resonating like the sound of Black conscience. And the most tormented and filled of anger, but not without wit or humor, is Trip, played by Denzel Washington, in one his greatest performances, which says a lot. Trip's character blossoms during the film's most defining moment, when he's whipped for having deserted the camp. The slow close-up on Washington, climaxing with the tear running on his face certainly earned him his first Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, but the tear is not acting, it powerfully captures the vivid wound in colored person's hearts: the repression of their inner feelings, the regulation of their minds so they can serve the whites without hurting their pride, and more than anything, to never speak. Eyes are said to be the tunnels of the soul, and Washington's eyes speak infinite statements about centuries of dehumanization. In a less powerful but no less significant moment, Freeman's characters talks to Shaw, he never makes eye contact, and when their eyes meet, he immediately looks away. It's only by keeping a low profile that he could speak and ask for 'more shoes', explaining that it was the reason Trip left the camp, it wasn't deserting. But the 'shoes' issue is only one of the several injustices the men had to endure besides the insults during training and the inferior wages that infuriated Trip who rightfully reminded that "Blacks stop bullet as fast as Whites". Shaw, by tearing up his own ticket, sealed with his men the sacred link that would never disappear, and that ultimately turned them into great soldiers. Yet the first baptism of fire is long to come, and even after getting their uniforms, they're still pushed into the background to accomplished menial work and some morally low actions, which the film was honest enough to tackle. I guess the actions some Blacks committed exacerbated the same resentment that inspired some parts of "The Birth of a Nation" except that Griffith's movie forgot that these men followed orders, and that war can turn every man into a savage beast with no distinction of race. It's for moments like this that the film works, it's because we know that these men are flawed that their sacrifices is even more heroic. The cinematography, the music, the realism of the battle scenes can compete with the greatest epics, but there's more than glory in "Glory": there's the beautiful irony that these men never fought before and they were lead by a youngster who had as much to prove, and the conjunction of these two ironies cemented an extraordinary achievement.

    Every great career needs a start and for Denzel Washington and most likely Morgan Freeman Glory was that start. I say it boosted Freeman because I looked and I didn't recognize anything before Glory, and of course even in the late 80s he looks old. Matthew Broderick stars in this Civil War movie about the Massachusetts 54th, the first all- black regiment in history. Any movie with slavery as a theme so you are sure to see a few things that are uncomfortable and the use of the "N" word, hope you can This movie is historically accurate and based off letters Colonel Shaw write home to his parents. When Matthew Broderick narrates I can only assume they are the real letters, or I hope so. I first saw Matthew Broderick in Godzilla so when I see him I think of Godzilla. I know he is in Ferris Bueller's Day Off so I was unsure how he would do in a serious role like this. He is playing a Colonel so he has to be a natural leader, and he is. His only real flaw I saw was his voice. He has a very soft voice and I picture a leader with a loud and clear voice. Can I say that made me hate his performance and the movie? No, but it is something worth mentioning. He does a great job as an actor and I loved the character and his awesome facial hair. Broderick was good, Freeman was great as always, but the glory behind the movie was Denzel Washington, pun intended. Denzel is an amazing actor and this was his big break. His performance earned him an Oscar in 1990 and his career was never the same again, it got better and better. This was very early in his career and we see his attitude and sarcastic humor he uses in many other roles in the future. I kept comparing his acting to D&eacute;j&agrave; vu, Remember the Titians, and Flight and I saw so many similarities and that was refreshing. The best scene with Denzel was the scene where he has to get whipped. That scene and the scene with the burning of the town were so powerful and emotional. Denzel gets set up at the post and his shirt is remover, exposing his back that has a million scars. He gets whipped and Denzel gives this stare right into Shaw's eyes, and he doesn't even flinch. He cringes a little bit but he takes it like it's nothing but finally lets out a tear at the end. That scene was hard to watch but it was so necessary to have in there for so many reasons. It gave Shaw an understanding and pushed the story forward and developed not just Denzel's character, but Broderick as Shaw as well. With a movie like this you know there will be scenes with racial tension, that's a given and they are there and not big deal. The big deal is how Shaw and his officers treat their black soldiers. I love how Shaw doesn't want to give his black friend from Boston, Thomas, any special treatment. Thomas is crying and embarrassed and asks to speak with his friend Shaw. Shaw says he needs to give a formal request to speak to a superior officer. It was a jerk move but it was also necessary. Shaw fights for equality of his soldiers. He wants them to get proper shoes and pay. He defends the men and the unity they show was so unexpected and rare for a movie like this. From the start Shaw supports what is right for his soldiers. I expected him to not be so fond and slowly grow to like them but not, immediately he fights for what is right. The music in this movie is outstanding, especially in the last fifteen minutes. Throughout the movie the music is catchy and awesome. The score for this movie is proudly on my iPod including the scene where they all sing their African song at the end. That song was stuck in my head for weeks the first time I saw it. That scene was also powerful and probably my favorite. The night before the battle they sing and stand as one, knowing most of them are going to die. Denzel has his emotional breakthrough. The entire movie he is a rock wall who is looking for a fight and he clearly has some problems but during this scene he seems human and it was awesome. Overall, Glory is a fantastic movie with very few flaws. The ending could have expanded a bit more, the last scene before the credits left me wanting a little more but I was overall satisfied. The acting was great, music was great, battle scenes were great, emotion was great, every scene was strong its own way, and the movie itself was great. Glory is a war movie but it's not like many war movies. Most war movies are about brotherhood and battle scenes but this movie isn't really like that. It's more unique in its own way. When it's all said and done Glory gets the glory of the WillyT Seal of Approval. I hope the second glory pun worked twice, if not, eh you'll get over it.

    I give the film almost a perfect score for its story-telling, cinematography, and entertainment value, 24 years since its premier. It's not at all dated - some period films show their age just by the hair styles worn of the times, or the music score (like WITNESS [1985] which has some unfortunate electronic music moments), but GLORY holds up quite well, and has become one of those Civil War "must-see" dramas. But I want to focus some on the performance of Denzel Washington. "Trip," his character, was built to fight everyone, because he refused to become a victim in any form or fashion. He enlisted as a hard-shelled bully and took his anger out on anyone who disagreed with him. Even his attire symbolized his defiance, with his cap cocked off-center, and wearing a color separate from most others in some scenes. Two moments in this film anchored Mr. Washington's status as a solid method actor. Most film-goers shed tears when watching as he was disciplined over something he needed, by watching Trip's reaction to his punishment. The camera unflinchingly crawled in, which was as powerful a moment as I can remember any actor's portrayal, and it still arguably one of the best scenes that an actor has evoked. I honestly think that this one scene sealed his Academy Award of best supporting actor. The other moment was when Trip was compelled to say some words the night before a battle. Never one to speak from his heart as it made him too vulnerable, he said little and yet his final thoughts spoke volumes: "We men, ain't we?" I think most people invested their hopes on Trip, and Mr. Washington delivered better than any actor could, transforming him from an enlisted thug to a soldier I would march with. I'm sure he drew on things he experienced in school, because I remember people like Trip. They focus on one person that they would bully on a daily basis, and "Searles" (Andre Braugher) was his victim. Those two were paired perfectly. I only thought that some moments were a little over-acted, which deserved a deduction. The film had many night scenes, and the VHS and DVD transfers I've seen always looked muddy with poor blacks and color rendition, which has done an injustice to the outstanding cinematography. GLORY has been released as a 4K master disc, and it's incredible. The price point is nice as well, especially if you find one used.

    The Civil War, or the War Between the States if you prefer, is an Emotional affair with a Capital E. Brother against Brother. Americans against Americans. The "fight" for Freedom and Unifacation. It was a valiant exercise, if among other things, and was a turning point in Consciousness, and Enlightenment if you will. At the time it was erroneously thought that Blacks would not fight, at least not like their betters, the White Soldiers. It was common to think that they would be undisciplined and hard to manage. Of course this was all racists nonsense. A mindset that some Humans were Superior to others. This mostly True account of one of the first Black regiments to be put to the test of Battle is, predictably, a situation rife with radical Beliefs coming in direct conflict with a very different reality, and the Film is charged with something akin to Spirituality. On screen this can be at times a heavy handed display with Angelic Choirs and somewhat simplistic Stereotypes. But the Cinematography, Acting, and landscape does its best to keep things from becoming overwhelmingly sentimental. It almost works, but it is just too ardent an affair and touches those parts of the Soul that Lincoln called "The Better Angels of Our Nature". Similarly, it is both sides that marched their Sons abreast into the grinder with little regard, and it is this Universal Truth, that makes this Conflict so persuasively passionate, regardless of Race, Creed, or Color.

    This film is not just my favorite war movie, but my favorite film, period. This is not so much a war movie as it is a movie that explores the yearning of a downtrodden people to fight and die for a cause in which they, too believe. There are 5 or 6 scenes in the film that are sublime. The scene in which Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and Tripp (Denzel Washington) discuss carrying the regimental flag is understated brilliance. Another scene in which the 54th march to battle between the white soldiers and earn their cheers chokes me up every time I watch it. If you have not seen this movie before, you have missed a hidden gem. Make a point to see it UNCUT and you won't be disappointed.

    GLORY, is the award winning biography and drama of the first African- American unit of ex-slaves and freemen to fight and die for everyone's freedom from bondage. It was also scheduled to play as a tribute to the 150th Anniversary of The Battle of Antietam, fought on September 17, 1862, near Sharpsburg, Maryland. While researching films and the Civil War I could not find a better feature that had a scene of Antietam, the bloodiest single-day battle in American history, with 23,000 casualties on both sides. In the opening scene of tonight's picture at Antietam you will see battle tactics as old as the Roman Legions that used to march side-by- side into the face the enemy. Which takes a lot more bravery than hiding behind a rock, but they eventually learned the costs for those tactics were too high. Historic and modern connections to Antietam include a who's who of Civil War legends: General Robert E. Lee led the army of Northern Virginia and George McClellan the Union Army. Famously serving under McClellan was General Hooker and General Ambrose Burnside whose nickname gave us the word we use today sideburns; and Abner Doubleday who invented baseball. They were all there, as well as Captain Robert Gould Shaw, the witness and story teller of tonight's film. I've also walked that part of Antietam battlefield known as Bloody Lane. I will never forget Ken Burn's documentary, The Civil War (which came out a year after Glory) saying you could walk from one end to the other, over a quarter-of-a-mile, over the dead bodies and never touch the earth. And even though the battle was a draw, the North lost more lives and had more wounded. The hero that saved the South from a total defeat that day was Culpeper born and raised General A.P. Hill who lead the reinforcements. The issues of emancipation and military service were intertwined from the start of the Civil War. News from Fort Sumter set off a rush by free black men to enlist in U.S. military units. They were turned away, however, because a Federal law dating from 1792 barred Negroes from bearing arms for the U.S. army (although they had served in the American Revolution and in the War of 1812). In Boston disappointed would-be volunteers met and requested that the Government modify its laws to permit their enlistment. The Lincoln administration wrestled with the idea of authorizing the recruitment of black troops, concerned that such a move would prompt the border states to secede. By mid-1862, however, the escalating number of former slaves (contrabands), the declining number of white volunteers, and the increasingly needs of the Union Army pushed the Government into reconsidering the ban. Soon after the Union Army turned back Lee's first invasion of the North at Antietam, the Emancipation Proclamation was announced, and black recruitment was pursued in earnest. But that's only the opening scene of tonight's moving story. Glory is a 1989 American dramatic war film directed by Edward Zwick and starring a then 27 year old Matthew Broderick, Denzel Washington, Cary Elwes and Morgan Freeman. The screenplay was based on the personal letters of Colonel Robert Gould Shaw who was 24 at the start of our story. Shaw was also at the nearby Battle Of Cedar Mountain. Earlier this week I found on-line some of his 200 letters now held at the Harvard University Archives. Here is a copy of one Shaw wrote from Culpeper when he was here 150 years ago. Glory is a celebration of a little-known act of mass courage during the War. Simply put, the heroes involved were long ignored by history due to racism. Those heroes were the all-black members of the 54th, headed by Col. Shaw, the son of an influential abolitionist (played by an uncredited Jane Alexander). Despite the fact that the Civil War is ostensibly being fought on their behalf, the black soldiers were denied virtually every privilege and amenity that is matter of course for their white counterparts; and they were given the most menial and demeaning of tasks. The unofficial leaders of the group are gravedigger John Rawlins (played by Morgan Freeman) and fugitive slave Trip (played by Denzel Washington), respectively representing the brains and heart of the organization. The 54th acquit them selves valiantly at Fort Wagner, South Carolina, charging a fortification manned by some 1,000 Confederates. (Flag bearer Sgt. William Harvey Carney was earliest African American Medal of Honor recipient for his actions at Ft. Hood) As the film approaches its climax, with James Horner's music, it's consumed almost entirely in the kind of pageantry that was once director John Ford's specialty. While one can quibble with aspects of the film, all are outweighed by the value of this moving picture in more widely disseminating an invaluable piece of history. By the end of the Civil War, roughly 179,000 black men (10% of the Union Army) served as soldiers in the U.S. Army and another 19,000 served in the Navy. Nearly 40,000 black soldiers died over the course of the war. In fact more American's of every color died in the Civil War than in all other American wars from the Revolution through the Korean War combined. No wonder the damage done is still healing. In conclusion, tonight even the ground we meet on, Mount Pony, was a Civil War site. The men and women who lived in the area 150 years ago are now gone, but their stories live on when we remember them.

    - B+ I likes this film more then I thought I would as I did not think that I would care much about this but it was great. The story is very well done in teaching the slaves how to fight as you see the prejudice of some of the whites have on the blacks and also how some people tried to help the blacks be better even if it meant being harsher. Some of the performances were well done, especially Morgan Freeman and Denzel Washington. The cinematography captures the time period with its surroundings and battles very well and deserves its 3 awards at the Oscars. A very good historical film.

    Let me start of by saying that I expected a lot more action and actual fighting in this film, however I am far from disappointed. It's surprising that a cast highlighted by Denzel Washington, Morgan Freeman, and Matthew Broderick isn't enough of a marketing tool to promote this film (I stumbled upon it accidentally, despite being a war film fanatic (or so I thought)). But it's not just the big names that make it a great watch; every character feels real, and each one is very likable due to their genuineness. I was also positively surprised at how light-hearted the journey of men of the 54th Regiment to equality and freedom was portrayed. Whether it was because of a lack of a clich&eacute; villain or the mens' ability to keep their spirits high - I don't know, but it made this film extremely pleasant and entertaining to watch.

    There are two kinds of war movie: those that field warriors who are compelled to fight by orders handed down to them from superiors who may or not have internalized the causethus reducing the cause to a localized mission of group survival (e.g., Black Hawk Down) or dissolving it into chaotic meaninglessness (e.g., Full Metal Jacket)and those in which the fighters themselves have internalized the cause, thus heightening its significance and strengthening their resolve. I tend to prefer the latter kind, and Glory is one of the best of that kind. Narrated through the actual letters of Union Colonel Robert Gould Shaw (Matthew Broderick) and beginning at the bloody Battle of Antietam, Glory tells the courageous, moving, true story of the first group of black soldiers enlisted to fight during the American Civil Wara war fought, in part, over the issue of slavery. Not every member of Shaw's unit is a slave. His friend since childhood, Thomas Searles (Andre Braugher), is an educated, free man, who speaks as though he walked out of a Charles Dickens novel. For the most part, Thomas's tent mateswho include a wise, respectful father-figure, John Rawlins (Morgan Freeman) and a stuttering, wide-eyed optimist, Jupiter Sharts (Jihmi Kennedy)are agreeable and loyal, fully committed to the cause and eager to fight for freedom and glory. Of course, agreeableness and consensus make for dull drama. Enter Trip, played by Denzel Washington, who introduces dissension, first by referring to Thomas as "Snowflake," and then by stressing irreconcilable differences between whites and blacks, breaking ranks to retrieve better shoes, refusing to accept "slave wages," and eventually picking a fight with a whole regiment of white Union soldiers. One layer out from Trip's quarrel with the world, Shaw confronts a Union army that denigrates his regiment, refusing them necessary supplies and the opportunity to fight. Real battle with the Confederacy seems like a faraway notion. But it will come soon enough, after a bit of effective blackmail by Shaw and another of his boyhood friends, Major Cabot Forbes (Cary Elwes), and the quelling of Trip's unproductive rebelliousness by Rawlins, as he points out that these white men Trip wants to brush aside are fighting, and dying, for himthat it's time for he and the rest of the 54th to "ante up" and fight for themselves, now that they've been given the chance. Glory relies on a series of overlapping setups followed by payoffs, most of which work beautifully. The opening staging of Antietam drives home the close-range brutality of warfare with rifle and bayonet, so that Shaw's harsh, pedantic treatment of the sharpshooting Sharts seems warranted after Shaw witnesses his men laughing and playacting a battle with their newly issued weapons. The presentation of Shaw's timidity, even through his own admission, sets up his first moment of glory, when he finally confronts the Quartermaster and obtains much-needed shoes for his men. Shaw's firm treatment of Sharts sets up Sharts' moment of glory in the first battle, where he proves his ability to load and discharge his weapon to Shaw's standard. Thomas's degradation, by both Trip and the sharp-tongued Mulcahy (and, to a subtler extent, by Shaw), finds redemption in this same first battle, when he saves Trip from certain death. Finally, after twice refusing to carry the flag, Trip picks it up in the ending battle, upon Shaw's fall, and attempts to lead the final charge. Although our heroes perish in their failed attempt to take the fort, the true victory is written in the afterword: 180,000 black troops volunteered after learning of the bravery of the 54th. Denzel Washington's Oscar-winning performance in this movie is consistently, outstandingly brilliant, both from the perspective of character detail and emotional impact. In the scene in which Trip is whipped for "deserting" the regiment, Washington summons the resiliency, defiance, pain, futility, and sorrow of generations of enslaved brothers and sisters, and expresses the anguish of their considerable plight against the frivolity of the "punishment" at hand. And he does this without saying a word. James Horner's music, for this scene especially, as well as for the final battle scene, is magnificent. Edward Zwick's direction of the final battle and his handling, throughout the film, of camera, conflict, and character, is glorious. Why this movie wasn't nominated for Best Picture is beyond my comprehension. What is within my comprehension is my opinion that Glory was the best picture of 1989.
