    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    - This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    - This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    - This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    - This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements.

    Paths of Glory is another crowning achievement in Stanley Kubrick's filmography. This anti-war film is a masterpiece on so many levels I don't even know where to begin with. The cinematography is majestic and I was amazed by the way they filmed the battle scenes in the field, being always epic and intense. Also, there is one continuous shot in the trenches that really captured the fear and despair in the soldiers facial expressions and gestures. As for the acting, it was simply top notch. Kirk Douglas gave one of the most sincere and emotional performances in the history of cinema in my opinion and George Mcready was very impressive as the proud and ruthless general. Finally, the story has a lot of depth, making you constantly ponder about the bleak and depressing view on humanity shown in several moments here. The ending scene is quite powerful and cathartic, making Paths of Glory one of the best war films ever made.

    Kubrick's Paths of Glory, as has been reported by other reviewers, is a masterpiece of film making. The acting is excellent. The camera work is extraordinary. The script is lean and powerful. It also conveys a powerful message. It may be an anti-war message, but I think it is, more accurately, a message about the officers who advance through the ranks via military politics and who lead others even though they themselves are morally bankrupt. One must inevitably compare the movie to Breaker Morant, another film about military leadership, including courtroom scenes and three defendants. One could think that Breaker Morant owes much to Paths of Glory, but Breaker Morant is based upon a true story from the Boer War. As good as Paths of Glory is, Breaker Morant is one of my favorite films. I think it has more depth of emotion. But Paths of Glory is a must see.

    I'm not going to really spoil it other than to say that its ending is one of the greatest endings in all of movie history. This movie is a profound, and moving, story, based on real life incidents in World War I. It offers a shocking depiction of what war is really about. Interesting that Adolphe Menjou, a real life coward and quisling and traitor to his people, plays someone here who is about on the same level. Kirk Douglas's best role ever, in my book. The imagery is very stark, and very piercing and hard hitting. The story is beyond sad. And yet the ending offers a measure of hope. Awesome flick.

    A stirring condemnation of aristocracy and the hierarchical society that Europe was, Kubrick is very deliberate in framing the French command as self-serving, maniacal egomaniacs. Taking very loosely from a real historic event, the original author, playwright and screenwriter fashioned it into a telling damnation of those with no respect for human life and who so willingly abuse their power to dispose of it for their own purposes. Extremely heavy-headed, but soul stirring and wonderful all the same, a true masterpiece of film and a must see for anyone needing a reminder of how infrequently the true heroes of society are ever justly given their due. A masterpiece of satire, reinforcing the relationship of authority, establishment and the church working together to justify tremendously inhumane punishments and judgements. Kirk Douglas is absolutely stunning and the commanders stellar in presenting themselves oblivious to everything but their own ambitions and desire for glory.

    Having watched this film for the umpteenth time today, I can only say that I've never seen a better film about WW1. The only one that comes close is the magnificent 'All Quiet on the Western Front' which, of course, sees the war from a German perspective though it's all too clear that life in the trenches was just as awful for both sides. 'Paths of Glory' is a film I see as being an understated masterpiece. The perceptions and objectives of those at the top are wholly different from the soldiers, probably mostly conscripts, at the sharp end and while the fighting men are mostly concerned about survival or death, their superiors worry more about their careers and images. Colonel Dax comes across as an honest officer, General Broulard (Adolphe Menjou) as a politician and General Mireau (George Macready) as an incompetent who's desperate not to be seen as a failure. At the end, the only real survivor is Broulard, as Mireau is headed for his own inquiry and Dax is on his way back to the front. The story may be slight but the power of the production is immense. How the director made such an extraordinary film from such limited material is a mark of his greatness. While many younger viewers will see its stark black and white presentation as off-putting, a more mature eye will be riveted by it. In some ways it's similar to 'Breaker Morant' but it's vastly superior; this is a truly great film.

    - This is Stanley Kubrick's 4th full length film released in 1957 as a drama and war film. Based on the a novel of the same name written by Humphrey Cobb this film stars Kirk Douglas one of the biggest actors at this time. The budget for this film was $935,000 with still an unknown gross. The plot of the film states '' When soldiers in WW1 refuse to continue with an impossible attack, their superiors decide to make an example of them''. The novel was originally considered controversial so the film being controversial was inevitable, the film shows a scene which involves the general ordering a bomb attack on his one squad after the squad refuses to fight because they had lost all hope of winning the ''Anthill' from the Germans. After the General had accused the soldiers of being cowardly he ordered three men to be picked from each regiment and executed this would be an example to the other soldiers. The film is considered to have one of the most emotional ending to any film. However in order for you to know just how sad the ending to this film is you have to know exactly the position the soldiers had been put into. After watching three innocent men killed for a crime they did not commit it was sure that these men were angry and sad but after watching the final scene it was evident that they we sad rather than angry. Before this film was released it was clear that most film audiences had never seen a hero or innocent men killed in such a violent and apparent way. Here is a quote from the book '' The Real Stanley Kubrick'' '' After seeing Paths of Glory I remember walking out on the street and thinking that I'd never seen anybody shot and killed in a movie before. I was 17, I'd seen a few (thousand) movies, and I soon realized that I'd been seeing it all my life: cowboys shooting Indians, Indians shooting cavalry, cops shooting robbers, good guys shooting bad guys, weak guys shooting strong guys, Japanese and Germans and Americans shooting one another - it was a staple of the cinema. This was the first time I'd seen it done in this way, as calculated and pitiless as a firing squad itself, no possibility to dissociate, no way to look someplace else''. After reading this quote it was i instantly knew why Paths of Glory got Stanley Kubrick the respect he deserved because of the risk he had taken. These men were innocent and to have them killed in such a way would have made not only the French government feel guilt but it would also make the audience realize things they never thought was possible in such a time. This film was intended to open the audience eyes to things that actually happened during the war, this again was done when Kubrick made the film ''Dr. Strangelove''. Which showed a humorous side to the cold war but while watching this film I realised the message Kubrick was trying to tell the audience. Although now these type of movies have been done time and time again I still feel this film stands to be the film that inspired most directors to tell the truth about war and just what really occurred even in the quarters of the people considered the heroes. ''Fun fact: Ridley Scott shot a half hour recreation of the trench and battle scenes from "Paths of Glory". Scott designed the sets, wrote the script, tracked down the correct props and blocked out all the camera moves, which were then photographed with a borrowed 35mm motion picture camera. The lead actor was Keith Barone. The film was shot in 1963 and the end result was never intended for broadcast. Scott's short film was deemed exceptionally praiseworthy by various students and instructors involved with the BBC's director's programme''.

    Kubrick offers us something of a glimpse into the injustice of the common solider with his movie Paths of Glory. We start of with a planed attack on the German army to be conducted by a battalion of French soldiers who are ill equipped for the battle ahead. When the battle proves to be a failure the leading general overseeing the attack decides to make an example of three randomly chosen men from the battalion. The men are to be tried under penalty of death for cowardice in the face of the enemy. With the film Paths of Glory we are given a look at what becomes of the common solider when he is being led by immoral superior officers only focused on there own personal gain. Peering into the emotions of men who have faced unbelievable circumstances and threw the efforts of one solider trying to save there lives. Paths of Glory in my opinion is one of Stanley Kubrick's best and most endearing works in his long list of excellent films. In showing us human fears on a personal level threw great story, wonderful camera work, and excellent acting Kubrick succeeds in making a spectacular anti-war film.

    Paths of Glory was Stanley Kubrick's fourth (including Fear and Desire) full feature film, released in 1957 when he was only twenty-nine years old, yet watching this film feels like your watching a work of art produced during the peak of a highly successful career of an experienced director, a moving and powerful masterpiece. In the previous year Stanley Kubrick had released The Killing, which although was not a commercial success and is regarded as relatively weak when compared to his later work. However watching The Killing it is not surprising that the same director would go on to create a film such as Paths of Glory, although more of a raw product than his later films, The Killing was still quite well received by critics at the time, a decent noir that showed plenty of signs of talent and potential. What is more surprising though is the fact that Paths of Glory was created only a year after The Killing. The craft and guild involved in the film are superb, with some of the best scenes ever constructed on display. Later war films contain many memorable scenes themselves; however the battle scenes in Paths of Glory are as good as any you will ever see with a fantastic scene in the first half when the attack on ant hill actually took place. The story of the film follows the trial of three soldiers who are being charged with cowardice when facing the enemy. The troops were ordered to carry out the outrageous and impossible task of capturing the German ant hill; originally a captain is hesitant to carry out this order from those above but agrees to at the opportunity of a promotion. Whilst only one third of the troops leave the trenches for the attack, only three are chosen for trial to attempt to make an example of their cowardice to discourage any future attempts of disobedience of orders. The trial scene in itself is expertly done, with Kirk Douglas as Col. Dax, a man who attempts to defend those wrongly on trial for their lives, delivering an emotional speech that ranks among the best ever given in the history of film. Douglas is fantastic throughout, with his good hearted and morally right intentions outlined at the films end when his motivations behind his defence of the troops on trial are questioned. Kubrick's anti-war film mocks the chain of command structure and structure put in place, focussing less on the war itself but more on those involved with it. Dr. Strangelove has long been one of my favourite Kubrick films and like Paths of Glory it also takes a critical stance against war, albeit in a more satirical manner. Paths of Glory works mainly because of the characters we are shown, aside from the excellent Douglas we also has a great supporting cast, we no what the likely fate of the troops are yet their characters are none the less important. Then there are the men responsible from above such as the characters portrayed by Menjou and MacCready, men we grow to dislike due to their own interests as Kubrick looks at the human and moral side of war. The film's final scene is beautifully symbolic and fitting as we see the future Mrs. Kubrick sing a song in front of a bar full of haggling men, battling on despite the unfavourable odds against her.

    Star Kirk Douglas knew full well this was a film worth making, and readily agreed when young director Stanley Kubrick (28 at the time) approached him to star in this memorable commentary on the insanity of war, specifically on the demands of military brass to produce results. Scripted by Kubrick, Calder Willingham, and Jim Thompson, this tells a convincing and compelling story in high style. Hollywood was loathe to tackle what was deemed controversial material, in the light of Americas' post WWII patriotism, but actor and director stood by the material. This film may not have been profitable in its initial release, but 56 years later its power remains intact. Based on a book by Humphrey Cobb, it tells the tale of trench warfare during WWI. French general Mireau (George Macready) orders his troops on a suicidal mission. When the mission fails, he determines to save face by selecting some of the soldiers for a court martial. The humanistic, realistic Colonel Dax (Douglas) insists on defending the three men - Corporal Paris (Ralph Meeker), Private Arnaud (Joe Turkel), and Private Ferol (Timothy Carey). However, Dax has his work cut out for him as proving that the fault lies with the brass, rather than the men in the trenches, will be most difficult indeed. A superb cast, also including Adolphe Menjou as General Broulard, Wayne Morris as Lieutenant Roget, Richard Anderson as the prosecutor, Peter Capell as the judge, and Susanne Christian - a.k.a. Christiane Kubrick, who would become the directors' wife for the next 40 plus years - as the German singer, helps bring this story to life. The mostly percussive music score by Gerald Fried also serves to drive the story forward without calling a lot of attention to itself. Genuinely harrowing battle footage is well staged and executed, and even though emotions are mostly held in check the plight of the three doomed soldiers earns our sympathies; when they start breaking down it's tough to see. And Kubricks' use of the moving camera adds a lot to the scenes in the trenches. With an impassioned performance by Douglas at its core, "Paths of Glory" is a quietly potent film and easily stands tall as one of the best films of its kind ever made. 10 out of 10.

    There is very little to say about the flaws of this film, and what little there is to say is quickly forgotten and overshadowed by the amazing performances of all the main actors, the deep, meaningful dialogues and the engaging, captivating story, which is presented in a well paced manner. Not once did I feel the movie was dragging on or rushing ahead too quickly, it really is perfectly paced. I must especially highlight the performances by K. Douglas and G. Macready. The rest of the cast is splendid too of course, but these two gentlemen truly made the movie for me. If you like war movies with an engaging storyline, without too great an emphasis on military combat itself but with a philosophical message conveyed through amazing dialogues and acting that draws you in for the entire screen time, then this movie is for you.
