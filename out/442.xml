    This straight-to-video effort has somewhat of a terrible reputation, especially compared to the rest of the series. I haven't seen any of the other films to follow it, but the ones before; the theatrical releases (1, 2 & 3) and straight-to-TV (4) production were much better for entertainment. Were as the previous entry "The Evil Escapes" didn't feature the haunted house; "The Amityville Curse" goes go back to the earlier films formula, although the house has taken on a different transformation and the visual impact of that is less imposing. But that wasn't the main issue. This goes to the storytelling (which this plot has nothing do with the actual Amityville curse), pacing and performances. Especially the acting. David Stain and Dawna Wightman simply aggravate as the obnoxious leads, one being pompous and the other simply whining. An unbearable combination. Helen Hughes gives the usual batty old lady shtick. Then there are static turns by Kim Coates and Cassandra Cava. Only Anthony Dean Rubes showed any sort of spark. Father Parcaecus is brutally murdered in his own confessional by a mysterious assailant. After the murder, the church is closed and the belongings along with the confessional are sealed in a small room in the basement of Parcaecus' house. Years have passed when Debbie and Marvin come across the vacant house and decide to purchase it for their investment club. They invite a couple of friends up to help renovate the old house, but this weekend turns out be a nightmare with a wave of supernatural events occurring. Bog-standard shenanigans (disappearing ghostly figures) populate mostly an uneventful and tedious haunted house story spending plenty of time on filler (house in need of repairs) and non-existent chills. The story is uninteresting, plods and the final revelation you can see coming miles away. The stale script is terrible. It throws many different and hysterical ideas about, but never convincingly gels them together and leaves things rather unfulfilled. Like Debbie's baffling connection to the house. Loose and lazy work with mystery plot ties. Technically speaking it's solid, but mechanically tired and flat in its execution. Not much in the way of bumps in the night. The "Curse" is a real snooze. "Things are usually cheap for a reason."

    I wish I could give it negative stars. If you are a fan of The Amityville series, or just movies in general, do not waste your time on this. You will be horribly disappointed. The plot and characters are poorly written., The writers obviously thought that riding the Amityville coat tales would be enough for a semi successful movie. They could not have been more wrong. This movie goes nowhere. It was like watching a poorly written sitcom: weak ploy, weak acting, It is not to often than one comes across a movie this horrible. I tried watching just hoping it would get better but I could not get through 20 minutes before shutting it off.

    I'm a fan of the original Amityville Horror film, and so naturally I wanted to see the sequels, so I started watching them all, and then I got to the 5th film, "The Amityville Curse", and this movie sucks. It is so horrible. It does not have anything to do with the other movies! It doesn't even have the Amityville house. I don't think this should be considered part of the franchise because it has nothing to do with the others. That's not the only problem though, the characters are terrible, it's not even remotely creepy or suspenseful, there is absolutely nothing at all to enjoy with this movie. It's one of my very least favorites. Do not watch it. If you are a fan of the Amityville movies don't watch it anyway, you won't miss anything, trust me.

    A unlikable middle-aged couple purchase a house that bears no resemblance to the Amityville house of previous films and have friends help them move in. Obviously things don't go well (for either them or the hapless viewer) as the house ahem houses the confessional booth that the previous owner/priest got killed in. Yeah I have no clue either. Doesn't really have anything to do with previous or later films in the diminutive series in the least and doesn't really have anything to recommend it at all. I was just waiting for the terrible thing (i refuse to call it a film lest i sully that term) to be over so i could wash the putrid stench from my body. My Grade: F-

    The fifth Amityville movie. Oh boy where to begin.... Well this one has nothing to do with Amityville except the fact that it is in the same town. The story is pretty much a murder mystery. Kinda like an episode of Matlock or Murder She wrote, except with no watchable qualities to it. The movie drags on and on. The plot is about a priest who was shot to death years ago during a confession. The confessional booth that the priest was killed in is brought to an old house. Twelve years later, a group of stuffy middle aged people move in and strange things start to happen. Broken mirrors, bad dreams, ghost sightings, etc. Now the funny thing is, the man who killed the priest in the beginning is shown smoking. Out of everyone in the movie, one person is a smoker. Gee, it doesn't take Perry Mason to put two and two together when it comes to naming the killer. The acting isn't the best either. Kim Coates appears bored with the whole experience. Unknown actress Dawna Wightman did okay portraying the innocent and sweet danger sensing lead character. The rest are practically meaningless to the movie. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it has nothing to do with Amityville. So we have a mixed up plot, poor acting, and a murder mystery that can be figured out in the opening twenty minutes. Not a very fun watch at all. I will say though, the confrontation with the killer in the last fifteen minutes is kind of fun. It's really the only watchable part of the whole thing. 3/10

    This movie starts off in a church and someone is confessing their sins in the box and then we see that the priest as be shot in the Confessing box that end up being in the Amityville house. Then movies moves on to number of old adults moving into the house and then Marvin and Debbie buy the house and three friends: Frank, Bill and Abigail come to stay for a while and the former housekeeper, Mrs Moriarty also stop by now and again. This movie did not feel like Amityville movie at all, as there were no Haunting scene in this movie at all saying that there were two haunting scenes in this movie made no sense what so ever and not even scary or creepy at all they were just pointless Dream scenes to waste time. This movie is more like a Who done movie and then near the end of the movie we find out who being killer is and turns that person as been possessed since start of movie, we never saw any signs of that person being possessed at all. (As to been one of the worst twist ever!) I have seen all the Amityville movies now, this movie is the most pointless Amityville sequel ever and there no need to see this movie at all, there is noT one second worth watching in this movie. If you don't want to waste 1 and half hours of your life Please!!!!! skip this movie and Carry on with the rest of the series they are better then this one (not great but better).

    When you reach a certain point in a series of films it's time to call it quits. If there's no more story, if the quality level had dropped, or if people have lost interest then why not lay it to rest? The third 'Amityville' movie was the last one to get a theatrical release because it made less money than the two before it, but that didn't stop anyone from making another sequel. There have even been several sequels to Jay Anson's novel, but not many would be adapted into feature films. Personally I like the first four movies in the series, but where do you go from there? Like the first film, this installment is based on a book only in this case the movie has little to do with it's predecessors or the book on which it's based. But believe me, those are the least of it's problems. Pros: Performances are adequate. Decent score. A couple good creepy moments. Finally comes to life in the finale. Cons: Sluggish pacing. Virtually plot less. Forgettable. Not scary at all. Bland direction. Very drab looking. Several plot holes. Long stretches where nothing interesting happens. Failed attempt at mystery. Final thoughts: No one asked for the other sequels either, but at least they provide some entertainment value. If you're going to make an unnecessary sequel the least you can do is make it entertaining and make it look like you cared about what you were doing. There are even worse sequels than 'The Amityville Curse,' but even if you're like me and you enjoyed the previous four you're better off skipping this one and checking out the ones that follow. My rating: 1.5/5

    As a director, I've always wanted to put a new "spin" to the Batman series. This doesn't mean that I think the other Batman films lack quality, I just believe I have something to contribute to the series. In my mind, this is what Tom Berry and Michael Krueger were thinking. They had an "idea" for the series. Nay, not to make the series better or worse, it was just an "idea" for the series. This adaptation to the story completely lacks promise, and mind you this is an adaptation, not a continuance of the series. The characters are not the same, and the bloody house doesn't even resemble the iconic frame of our creepy anti-protagonist of a building. So in the end you will be sitting through what seems like an endless time capsule of bad 90's hair, and boring "suspense" scenes. Because in all, you're not watching Amityville. You're watching some people's "idea of Amityville." And boy is that idea not scary at all. Pass this movie unless you are a die-hard Amityville-Nut. Well, because in order to enjoy this, you might just have to be one.

    A group of friends buy and move into an old Long Island house, where 12 years earlier, a priest was brutally murdered by a teenager who hanged himself before he could be tried by the police. Soon, the newcomers encounter strange and eventually fatal spectral visitations. Will any of them be intelligent enough to get out before the Amityville curse claims them? 'The Amityville Curse' bears about as much resemblance to 'The Amityville Horror' as a polar bear with lipstick does to Marilyn Monroe. It's little more than a generic haunted house tale dressed up with the Amityville banner - and when I say 'dressed up', I mean with the same amount of effort put into making a Kalahari bushman pass for a diving instructor by giving him a snorkel. Setting the events in Amityville and one throwaway line from a yokel in a bar about a kid murdering his parents doesn't make an Amityville film. But, I reasoned with myself, what the hell - maybe it'll be like 'Halloween III: Season Of The Witch', which had nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Myers, but was an enjoyable film in its own right. Unfortunately, a hackneyed and incoherent script, annoyingly drawn characters and torturous acting very quickly dashed that optimism against the rocks. Still, 'The Amityville Curse' does helpfully offer up suggestions on things you could be doing that would be less painful than watching it, like being menaced by domestic pets, playing with poisonous chemicals, or maybe having someone frisbee sharp cutting equipment into various parts of your body. Pretty much the only positive I can think of is the sultry presence of Cassandra Gava, who, unlike Kim Coates, seems to be putting some genuine effort into her part - possibly just to make the time go by quicker. There is some genuine acting talent in here, but they are unsurprisingly not inspired to prove this at any time by the script to hand, preferring to let Dawna Wightman crank up the hysterics to 10. Certainly, this isn't the first time I've asked myself why a film was made - I've seen 'Children Of The Corn VI', but 'The Amityville Curse' is definitely another head-scratcher. Its lazy, peripheral attempt to hang onto the coattails of the Amityville franchise only underscores a message we didn't need to learn - you can't staple a couple of Kraft singles to a tomato and call it a lasagne. Likewise, it isn't a decent horror film in its own right. If there truly is a curse here, it's brought to life every time someone decides to watch this thing.

    **SPOILERS** Another spin-off of the original 1979 movie "the Amityville Horror" which has really nothing to do with what made the house in Amityville famous, or infamous, in the first place! The 1974 murder of the family who resided there by their drugged up and satanically possessed son. In this film the movie has to do with the murder of a local priest,Jan Rubes,who had his brains blown out during confession by one of his church members! This all happened some 12 years earlier, in 1977, in the movie that we see in a long flashback. It's now 1989 and this group of friends, looking for a place to live in the country, from the big city end up spending the night at the dark and spooky house in Amityville. Warned by one of the local people the one-eyed Ms. Moriarty, Helen Hughes, that there's a curse on the house the people spending the night there laugh her off feeling that she's just an old eccentric looking for attention. It turns out that Mrs. Moriarty, whom we saw in the opening flashback sequence, is not as nutty as they think. She not only knows what the reason is for the priest's murder but who was the person who murdered him! The film slowly plays itself out in it going back to the murder of the priest whom we later find out was not as holy as he seemed to make himself out to be. it turned out that his alleged murderer, Ted A. Bohus, hung himself in police custody before he could make a confession to the priest's murder. The people staying in the house at first have no idea what the house, with all the books and movies written and released about it, represents: Death and Horror to those who dare to either buy or spend the night in it. It's only after the truth comes out, which takes almost the entire film, to what the reasons were behind the priests murder and who in fact murdered him that the proverbial sh*t really hits the fan! It's then that the past that was so conveniently hidden by the killer, and Mrs. Moriarty, comes to the surface like a sudden blast out of a volcano. Unlike the previous Amityville Horror movies this one has really nothing at all to do with the supernatural or the cursed house itself. There's a subplot in the film involving one of the persons staying at the house Debbie, Dawna Wightman, who seems to be possessed by the place but it's never fully explained why. If Debbie is so in tuned with the horror, by who the killer is, awaiting her and her friends she in fact was one the last persons to realize it. The obvious unseen killer, by his own actions, could have been spotted almost as soon as he came on the scene but it took a murderous attack on Debbie by him for her to realize just who he is! So much for Debbie's, together with the help of Mrs. Moriarty, extrasensory perception and psychic powers! One of the better Amityville Horror sequels even though it was more like a whodunit-like murder mystery then a supernatural horror movie.

You're watching some people's "idea of Amityville." And boy is that idea not scary at all. Pass this movie unless you are a die-hard Amityville-Nut. Well, because in order to enjoy this, you might just have to be one.

    A group of friends buy and move into an old Long Island house, where 12 years earlier, a priest was brutally murdered by a teenager who hanged himself before he could be tried by the police. Soon, the newcomers encounter strange and eventually fatal spectral visitations. Will any of them be intelligent enough to get out before the Amityville curse claims them? 'The Amityville Curse' bears about as much resemblance to 'The Amityville Horror' as a polar bear with lipstick does to Marilyn Monroe. It's little more than a generic haunted house tale dressed up with the Amityville banner - and when I say 'dressed up', I mean with the same amount of effort put into making a Kalahari bushman pass for a diving instructor by giving him a snorkel. Setting the events in Amityville and one throwaway line from a yokel in a bar about a kid murdering his parents doesn't make an Amityville film. But, I reasoned with myself, what the hell - maybe it'll be like 'Halloween III: Season Of The Witch', which had nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Myers, but was an enjoyable film in its own right. Unfortunately, a hackneyed and incoherent script, annoyingly drawn characters and torturous acting very quickly dashed that optimism against the rocks. Still, 'The Amityville Curse' does helpfully offer up suggestions on things you could be doing that would be less painful than watching it, like being menaced by domestic pets, playing with poisonous chemicals, or maybe having someone frisbee sharp cutting equipment into various parts of your body. Pretty much the only positive I can think of is the sultry presence of Cassandra Gava, who, unlike Kim Coates, seems to be putting some genuine effort into her part - possibly just to make the time go by quicker. There is some genuine acting talent in here, but they are unsurprisingly not inspired to prove this at any time by the script to hand, preferring to let Dawna Wightman crank up the hysterics to 10. Certainly, this isn't the first time I've asked myself why a film was made - I've seen 'Children Of The Corn VI', but 'The Amityville Curse' is definitely another head-scratcher. Its lazy, peripheral attempt to hang onto the coattails of the Amityville franchise only underscores a message we didn't need to learn - you can't staple a couple of Kraft singles to a tomato and call it a lasagne. Likewise, it isn't a decent horror film in its own right. If there truly is a curse here, it's brought to life every time someone decides to watch this thing.

    **SPOILERS** Another spin-off of the original 1979 movie "the Amityville Horror" which has really nothing to do with what made the house in Amityville famous, or infamous, in the first place! The 1974 murder of the family who resided there by their drugged up and satanically possessed son. In this film the movie has to do with the murder of a local priest,Jan Rubes,who had his brains blown out during confession by one of his church members! This all happened some 12 years earlier, in 1977, in the movie that we see in a long flashback. It's now 1989 and this group of friends, looking for a place to live in the country, from the big city end up spending the night at the dark and spooky house in Amityville. Warned by one of the local people the one-eyed Ms. Moriarty, Helen Hughes, that there's a curse on the house the people spending the night there laugh her off feeling that she's just an old eccentric looking for attention. It turns out that Mrs. Moriarty, whom we saw in the opening flashback sequence, is not as nutty as they think. She not only knows what the reason is for the priest's murder but who was the person who murdered him! The film slowly plays itself out in it going back to the murder of the priest whom we later find out was not as holy as he seemed to make himself out to be. it turned out that his alleged murderer, Ted A. Bohus, hung himself in police custody before he could make a confession to the priest's murder. The people staying in the house at first have no idea what the house, with all the books and movies written and released about it, represents: Death and Horror to those who dare to either buy or spend the night in it. It's only after the truth comes out, which takes almost the entire film, to what the reasons were behind the priests murder and who in fact murdered him that the proverbial sh*t really hits the fan! It's then that the past that was so conveniently hidden by the killer, and Mrs. Moriarty, comes to the surface like a sudden blast out of a volcano. Unlike the previous Amityville Horror movies this one has really nothing at all to do with the supernatural or the cursed house itself. There's a subplot in the film involving one of the persons staying at the house Debbie, Dawna Wightman, who seems to be possessed by the place but it's never fully explained why. If Debbie is so in tuned with the horror, by who the killer is, awaiting her and her friends she in fact was one the last persons to realize it. The obvious unseen killer, by his own actions, could have been spotted almost as soon as he came on the scene but it took a murderous attack on Debbie by him for her to realize just who he is! So much for Debbie's, together with the help of Mrs. Moriarty, extrasensory perception and psychic powers! One of the better Amityville Horror sequels even though it was more like a whodunit-like murder mystery then a supernatural horror movie.

    This straight-to-video effort has somewhat of a terrible reputation, especially compared to the rest of the series. I haven't seen any of the other films to follow it, but the ones before; the theatrical releases (1, 2 & 3) and straight-to-TV (4) production were much better for entertainment. Were as the previous entry "The Evil Escapes" didn't feature the haunted house; "The Amityville Curse" goes go back to the earlier films formula, although the house has taken on a different transformation and the visual impact of that is less imposing. But that wasn't the main issue. This goes to the storytelling (which this plot has nothing do with the actual Amityville curse), pacing and performances. Especially the acting. David Stain and Dawna Wightman simply aggravate as the obnoxious leads, one being pompous and the other simply whining. An unbearable combination. Helen Hughes gives the usual batty old lady shtick. Then there are static turns by Kim Coates and Cassandra Cava. Only Anthony Dean Rubes showed any sort of spark. Father Parcaecus is brutally murdered in his own confessional by a mysterious assailant. After the murder, the church is closed and the belongings along with the confessional are sealed in a small room in the basement of Parcaecus' house. Years have passed when Debbie and Marvin come across the vacant house and decide to purchase it for their investment club. They invite a couple of friends up to help renovate the old house, but this weekend turns out be a nightmare with a wave of supernatural events occurring. Bog-standard shenanigans (disappearing ghostly figures) populate mostly an uneventful and tedious haunted house story spending plenty of time on filler (house in need of repairs) and non-existent chills. The story is uninteresting, plods and the final revelation you can see coming miles away. The stale script is terrible. It throws many different and hysterical ideas about, but never convincingly gels them together and leaves things rather unfulfilled. Like Debbie's baffling connection to the house. Loose and lazy work with mystery plot ties. Technically speaking it's solid, but mechanically tired and flat in its execution. Not much in the way of bumps in the night. The "Curse" is a real snooze. "Things are usually cheap for a reason."

    I wish I could give it negative stars. If you are a fan of The Amityville series, or just movies in general, do not waste your time on this. You will be horribly disappointed. The plot and characters are poorly written., The writers obviously thought that riding the Amityville coat tales would be enough for a semi successful movie. They could not have been more wrong. This movie goes nowhere. It was like watching a poorly written sitcom: weak ploy, weak acting, It is not to often than one comes across a movie this horrible. I tried watching just hoping it would get better but I could not get through 20 minutes before shutting it off.

    I'm a fan of the original Amityville Horror film, and so naturally I wanted to see the sequels, so I started watching them all, and then I got to the 5th film, "The Amityville Curse", and this movie sucks. It is so horrible. It does not have anything to do with the other movies! It doesn't even have the Amityville house. I don't think this should be considered part of the franchise because it has nothing to do with the others. That's not the only problem though, the characters are terrible, it's not even remotely creepy or suspenseful, there is absolutely nothing at all to enjoy with this movie. It's one of my very least favorites. Do not watch it. If you are a fan of the Amityville movies don't watch it anyway, you won't miss anything, trust me.

    A unlikable middle-aged couple purchase a house that bears no resemblance to the Amityville house of previous films and have friends help them move in. Obviously things don't go well (for either them or the hapless viewer) as the house ahem houses the confessional booth that the previous owner/priest got killed in. Yeah I have no clue either. Doesn't really have anything to do with previous or later films in the diminutive series in the least and doesn't really have anything to recommend it at all. I was just waiting for the terrible thing (i refuse to call it a film lest i sully that term) to be over so i could wash the putrid stench from my body. My Grade: F-

    The fifth Amityville movie. Oh boy where to begin.... Well this one has nothing to do with Amityville except the fact that it is in the same town. The story is pretty much a murder mystery. Kinda like an episode of Matlock or Murder She wrote, except with no watchable qualities to it. The movie drags on and on. The plot is about a priest who was shot to death years ago during a confession. The confessional booth that the priest was killed in is brought to an old house. Twelve years later, a group of stuffy middle aged people move in and strange things start to happen. Broken mirrors, bad dreams, ghost sightings, etc. Now the funny thing is, the man who killed the priest in the beginning is shown smoking. Out of everyone in the movie, one person is a smoker. Gee, it doesn't take Perry Mason to put two and two together when it comes to naming the killer. The acting isn't the best either. Kim Coates appears bored with the whole experience. Unknown actress Dawna Wightman did okay portraying the innocent and sweet danger sensing lead character. The rest are practically meaningless to the movie. But the biggest problem with the movie is that it has nothing to do with Amityville. So we have a mixed up plot, poor acting, and a murder mystery that can be figured out in the opening twenty minutes. Not a very fun watch at all. I will say though, the confrontation with the killer in the last fifteen minutes is kind of fun. It's really the only watchable part of the whole thing. 3/10

    This movie starts off in a church and someone is confessing their sins in the box and then we see that the priest as be shot in the Confessing box that end up being in the Amityville house. Then movies moves on to number of old adults moving into the house and then Marvin and Debbie buy the house and three friends: Frank, Bill and Abigail come to stay for a while and the former housekeeper, Mrs Moriarty also stop by now and again. This movie did not feel like Amityville movie at all, as there were no Haunting scene in this movie at all saying that there were two haunting scenes in this movie made no sense what so ever and not even scary or creepy at all they were just pointless Dream scenes to waste time. This movie is more like a Who done movie and then near the end of the movie we find out who being killer is and turns that person as been possessed since start of movie, we never saw any signs of that person being possessed at all. (As to been one of the worst twist ever!) I have seen all the Amityville movies now, this movie is the most pointless Amityville sequel ever and there no need to see this movie at all, there is noT one second worth watching in this movie. If you don't want to waste 1 and half hours of your life Please!!!!! skip this movie and Carry on with the rest of the series they are better then this one (not great but better).

    When you reach a certain point in a series of films it's time to call it quits. If there's no more story, if the quality level had dropped, or if people have lost interest then why not lay it to rest? The third 'Amityville' movie was the last one to get a theatrical release because it made less money than the two before it, but that didn't stop anyone from making another sequel. There have even been several sequels to Jay Anson's novel, but not many would be adapted into feature films. Personally I like the first four movies in the series, but where do you go from there? Like the first film, this installment is based on a book only in this case the movie has little to do with it's predecessors or the book on which it's based. But believe me, those are the least of it's problems. Pros: Performances are adequate. Decent score. A couple good creepy moments. Finally comes to life in the finale. Cons: Sluggish pacing. Virtually plot less. Forgettable. Not scary at all. Bland direction. Very drab looking. Several plot holes. Long stretches where nothing interesting happens. Failed attempt at mystery. Final thoughts: No one asked for the other sequels either, but at least they provide some entertainment value. If you're going to make an unnecessary sequel the least you can do is make it entertaining and make it look like you cared about what you were doing. There are even worse sequels than 'The Amityville Curse,' but even if you're like me and you enjoyed the previous four you're better off skipping this one and checking out the ones that follow. My rating: 1.5/5

    As a director, I've always wanted to put a new "spin" to the Batman series. This doesn't mean that I think the other Batman films lack quality, I just believe I have something to contribute to the series. In my mind, this is what Tom Berry and Michael Krueger were thinking. They had an "idea" for the series. Nay, not to make the series better or worse, it was just an "idea" for the series. This adaptation to the story completely lacks promise, and mind you this is an adaptation, not a continuance of the series. The characters are not the same, and the bloody house doesn't even resemble the iconic frame of our creepy anti-protagonist of a building. So in the end you will be sitting through what seems like an endless time capsule of bad 90's hair, and boring "suspense" scenes. Because in all, you're not watching Amityville. You're watching some people's "idea of Amityville." And boy is that idea not scary at all. Pass this movie unless you are a die-hard Amityville-Nut. Well, because in order to enjoy this, you might just have to be one.

    This movie starts off in a church and someone is confessing their sins in the box and then we see that the priest as be shot in the Confessing box that end up being in the Amityville house. Then movies moves on to number of old adults moving into the house and then Marvin and Debbie buy the house and three friends: Frank, Bill and Abigail come to stay for a while and the former housekeeper, Mrs Moriarty also stop by now and again. This movie did not feel like Amityville movie at all, as there were no Haunting scene in this movie at all saying that there were two haunting scenes in this movie made no sense what so ever and not even scary or creepy at all they were just pointless Dream scenes to waste time. This movie is more like a Who done movie and then near the end of the movie we find out who being killer is and turns that person as been possessed since start of movie, we never saw any signs of that person being possessed at all. (As to been one of the worst twist ever!) I have seen all the Amityville movies now, this movie is the most pointless Amityville sequel ever and there no need to see this movie at all, there is noT one second worth watching in this movie. If you don't want to waste 1 and half hours of your life Please!!!!! skip this movie and Carry on with the rest of the series they are better then this one (not great but better).

    When you reach a certain point in a series of films it's time to call it quits. If there's no more story, if the quality level had dropped, or if people have lost interest then why not lay it to rest? The third 'Amityville' movie was the last one to get a theatrical release because it made less money than the two before it, but that didn't stop anyone from making another sequel. There have even been several sequels to Jay Anson's novel, but not many would be adapted into feature films. Personally I like the first four movies in the series, but where do you go from there? Like the first film, this installment is based on a book only in this case the movie has little to do with it's predecessors or the book on which it's based. But believe me, those are the least of it's problems. Pros: Performances are adequate. Decent score. A couple good creepy moments. Finally comes to life in the finale. Cons: Sluggish pacing. Virtually plot less. Forgettable. Not scary at all. Bland direction. Very drab looking. Several plot holes. Long stretches where nothing interesting happens. Failed attempt at mystery. Final thoughts: No one asked for the other sequels either, but at least they provide some entertainment value. If you're going to make an unnecessary sequel the least you can do is make it entertaining and make it look like you cared about what you were doing. There are even worse sequels than 'The Amityville Curse,' but even if you're like me and you enjoyed the previous four you're better off skipping this one and checking out the ones that follow. My rating: 1.5/5

    As a director, I've always wanted to put a new "spin" to the Batman series. This doesn't mean that I think the other Batman films lack quality, I just believe I have something to contribute to the series. In my mind, this is what Tom Berry and Michael Krueger were thinking. They had an "idea" for the series. Nay, not to make the series better or worse, it was just an "idea" for the series. This adaptation to the story completely lacks promise, and mind you this is an adaptation, not a continuance of the series. The characters are not the same, and the bloody house doesn't even resemble the iconic frame of our creepy anti-protagonist of a building. So in the end you will be sitting through what seems like an endless time capsule of bad 90's hair, and boring "suspense" scenes. Because in all, you're not watching Amityville. You're watching some people's "idea of Amityville." And boy is that idea not scary at all. Pass this movie unless you are a die-hard Amityville-Nut. Well, because in order to enjoy this, you might just have to be one.

    A group of friends buy and move into an old Long Island house, where 12 years earlier, a priest was brutally murdered by a teenager who hanged himself before he could be tried by the police. Soon, the newcomers encounter strange and eventually fatal spectral visitations. Will any of them be intelligent enough to get out before the Amityville curse claims them? 'The Amityville Curse' bears about as much resemblance to 'The Amityville Horror' as a polar bear with lipstick does to Marilyn Monroe. It's little more than a generic haunted house tale dressed up with the Amityville banner - and when I say 'dressed up', I mean with the same amount of effort put into making a Kalahari bushman pass for a diving instructor by giving him a snorkel. Setting the events in Amityville and one throwaway line from a yokel in a bar about a kid murdering his parents doesn't make an Amityville film. But, I reasoned with myself, what the hell - maybe it'll be like 'Halloween III: Season Of The Witch', which had nothing whatsoever to do with Michael Myers, but was an enjoyable film in its own right. Unfortunately, a hackneyed and incoherent script, annoyingly drawn characters and torturous acting very quickly dashed that optimism against the rocks. Still, 'The Amityville Curse' does helpfully offer up suggestions on things you could be doing that would be less painful than watching it, like being menaced by domestic pets, playing with poisonous chemicals, or maybe having someone frisbee sharp cutting equipment into various parts of your body. Pretty much the only positive I can think of is the sultry presence of Cassandra Gava, who, unlike Kim Coates, seems to be putting some genuine effort into her part - possibly just to make the time go by quicker. There is some genuine acting talent in here, but they are unsurprisingly not inspired to prove this at any time by the script to hand, preferring to let Dawna Wightman crank up the hysterics to 10. Certainly, this isn't the first time I've asked myself why a film was made - I've seen 'Children Of The Corn VI', but 'The Amityville Curse' is definitely another head-scratcher. Its lazy, peripheral attempt to hang onto the coattails of the Amityville franchise only underscores a message we didn't need to learn - you can't staple a couple of Kraft singles to a tomato and call it a lasagne. Likewise, it isn't a decent horror film in its own right. If there truly is a curse here, it's brought to life every time someone decides to watch this thing.

    **SPOILERS** Another spin-off of the original 1979 movie "the Amityville Horror" which has really nothing to do with what made the house in Amityville famous, or infamous, in the first place! The 1974 murder of the family who resided there by their drugged up and satanically possessed son. In this film the movie has to do with the murder of a local priest,Jan Rubes,who had his brains blown out during confession by one of his church members! This all happened some 12 years earlier, in 1977, in the movie that we see in a long flashback. It's now 1989 and this group of friends, looking for a place to live in the country, from the big city end up spending the night at the dark and spooky house in Amityville. Warned by one of the local people the one-eyed Ms. Moriarty, Helen Hughes, that there's a curse on the house the people spending the night there laugh her off feeling that she's just an old eccentric looking for attention. It turns out that Mrs. Moriarty, whom we saw in the opening flashback sequence, is not as nutty as they think. She not only knows what the reason is for the priest's murder but who was the person who murdered him! The film slowly plays itself out in it going back to the murder of the priest whom we later find out was not as holy as he seemed to make himself out to be. it turned out that his alleged murderer, Ted A. Bohus, hung himself in police custody before he could make a confession to the priest's murder. The people staying in the house at first have no idea what the house, with all the books and movies written and released about it, represents: Death and Horror to those who dare to either buy or spend the night in it. It's only after the truth comes out, which takes almost the entire film, to what the reasons were behind the priests murder and who in fact murdered him that the proverbial sh*t really hits the fan! It's then that the past that was so conveniently hidden by the killer, and Mrs. Moriarty, comes to the surface like a sudden blast out of a volcano. Unlike the previous Amityville Horror movies this one has really nothing at all to do with the supernatural or the cursed house itself. There's a subplot in the film involving one of the persons staying at the house Debbie, Dawna Wightman, who seems to be possessed by the place but it's never fully explained why. If Debbie is so in tuned with the horror, by who the killer is, awaiting her and her friends she in fact was one the last persons to realize it. The obvious unseen killer, by his own actions, could have been spotted almost as soon as he came on the scene but it took a murderous attack on Debbie by him for her to realize just who he is! So much for Debbie's, together with the help of Mrs. Moriarty, extrasensory perception and psychic powers! One of the better Amityville Horror sequels even though it was more like a whodunit-like murder mystery then a supernatural horror movie.
