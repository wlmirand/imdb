    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    This is a solid 7 of a film, but not the top 250 type imho I suspect that Audrey Hepburn's presence has a lot to do with this Positives, The standard of the cast, Comedy thriller - a difficult balancing act, Alfred Hitchcock pastiche Negatives, Would be better with a length of 90 minutes (But I would like almost all films to be cut down to a degree), Cary Grant looked a shade older than optimum, Audrey Hepburn kept throwing herself at the Cary Grant character - looks unconvincing, Lacks the touch of Hitchcock's best work Nevertheless altogether a pleasant viewing

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    This is a solid 7 of a film, but not the top 250 type imho I suspect that Audrey Hepburn's presence has a lot to do with this Positives, The standard of the cast, Comedy thriller - a difficult balancing act, Alfred Hitchcock pastiche Negatives, Would be better with a length of 90 minutes (But I would like almost all films to be cut down to a degree), Cary Grant looked a shade older than optimum, Audrey Hepburn kept throwing herself at the Cary Grant character - looks unconvincing, Lacks the touch of Hitchcock's best work Nevertheless altogether a pleasant viewing

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting.

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.

    This movie wasn't directed by Hitchcock but still gives you a feeling of watching one. It starts as a romantic-comedy movie but later leads into something mysterious. Keeps the viewer guessing the villain throughout the entire movie and director Stanley Donen does it too well. Not only the villain but also the Character name of Cary Grant is a mystery (Peter Joshua alias Alexander Dyle, alias Adam Canfield alias Brian Cruikshank). Henri Mancini's Oscar-nominated score supported the on-screen romance scenes for Grant and Hepburn (ignoring the actor's 20 years age gap). Ned Glass was awesome, the way he sneeze adds comic element. Kennedy and Coburn were cool in their roles too.

    Charade is in a genre of its own: the romantic caper comedy thriller. The colors and shapes of the title sequence belong unmistakably to the early 1960s, as do the characters' clothes, hairstyles, and speech mannerisms. Yet over 50 years after its release the humor is still fresh, the twists still surprise, and Audrey and Cary are still the epitome of cool. The supporting actors, especially Walter Matthau and James Coburn, give the movie a sharp edge and high stakes. It is no hyperbole to say that Charade is one of the most purely entertaining films of all time. It is also arguably the best film that either Hepburn or Grant made during their long and very successful careers.

    Cary Grant is my favorite actor, and this is a good film...but not his best (although far better than "To Catch A Thief"). Every time I've watched this film, I've though there is just something not quite right here, but I've never been able to put my finger on it. Grant is charming as ever, even as a potential murderer. Audrey Hepburn is a charming victim of being married to the wrong man. Hence the mystery for something that started during WWII. Maybe what I don't like about the film is that you are never quite sure who the bad guy(s) really are, although Walter Matthau (in his pre-comedy days), Ned Glass, James Coburn, and George Kennedy give you a pretty good idea of the type of criminals we're dealing wih there. The question is, is Grant a criminal, too? Thus, the crux of the story. The ending is first truly clever, and then truly charming. But there's still something not quite right. Let's put it this way: I probably have 20 Cary Grant in my DVD collection, but this is not one of them. Not saying pass it up, but just not my favorite, or close to it.

    I guess I should mention that I'm a sucker for a good mystery novel. I love reading them, and I enjoy being surprised at the end. Of course, the best mysteries won't rely entirely on a shocking conclusion. Witty dialogue, memorable characters, reasonable suspense, and most importantly, plot twists, must be peppered and laced throughout. The great thing about Charade, is that it takes everything that you could possibly want in a mystery novel, and puts it all under one roof. A young woman named Regina Lambert finds herself in possession of a large sum of money when her husband dies and leaves her $250,000. Unfortunately for her, three men are convinced that the money is theirs, and they're determined to get it back. With no one else to turn to, Regina puts her trust in a stranger named Peter Joshua. The two must now not only outsmart the three crooks, but also solve the mystery Regina's husband has left behind. Charade ingeniously blends the best elements of any mystery book, into a single film, creating an engaging and entertaining experience that's both intelligent and exciting. Clever dialogue and some quirky situations helps inject humor and fun into the production, while a handful of chase scenes keeps things exciting. With the added threat of three crooks living right next door, Charade is rarely dull. The romance between the two leads is surprisingly well done. It's a little overdone at times, but it's not too schmaltzy, nor too formulaic. It finds a perfect balance that few films ever achieve. The chemistry between the leads is excellent, as their personalities easily compliment each other. Modern romance films should take notes. The mystery itself is genius. There are several plot twists throughout, but all of them seem minuscule when compared to the grand finale. While many similar films often fails to provide much punch during the "revealing" stage, Charade pulls of it's big twist at the end beautifully. Characters are both memorable, and likable (or dislikeable, depending on intentions), with great acting to boot. Audrey Hepburn as Regina may appear helpless at first, but she quickly becomes an independent and brave woman, ready to fend for herself. Cary Grant as Peter is suave, but without being romantic. His maturity contrasts Regina's childishness. The three crooks (James Corburn, George Kennedy, and Ned Glass) are menacing, though not as defined as other characters. Jacques Marin as Inspector Grandpierre gets several laughs as the cranky policeman. The score, composed by Henry Mancini, is excellent. Often jazzy, but not without suspense and tension, it's a solid work from the master composer. A truly thrilling and surprising film, Charade is an extremely charming and masterfully made production. With a great cast, witty screenplay, and some great twists, this is the ideal mystery movie. If you're the kind that enjoys mystery novels, this is for you. If you're not into mystery novels, try it anyway.

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    for mystery, performance and clothes. for smart script and Audrey Hepburn. for the same Cary Grant. and for the crumbs of love. sure, the central character is Paris. but this fact is not very significant. because its air, colors and smell are only support for a great show in which the facts are always skin of things and reality - a convention very strange.a good movie with flavor of past time. because the inspired cast, the beautiful intrigue, the spiced dialogs are ingredients of different way to build life. and art. because not passing time is obstacle to recreate universe of a film from 1960 's but the special sensitivity of that space. that is all. not the traces of spies and precious clue - meeting with Cap de bour remains, for me, touching moment - but the chaotic level of emotions.

    Tossed off a train like a sack of flour, a body dressed only in pajamas and a housecoat tumbles from the tracks down an embankment. Then the credits appear. Colorful and wavy lines morph into a labyrinth, then spinning fan-like wheels, and then turning arrows. Yes we will soon discover that this movie is like a maze, an enigma; nothing is what it seems. The next scene is at a ski resort at the Haute-Savoie Alps, where our heroine, Mrs. Regina Lampert (Audrey Hepburn), a EURESCO translator, tells her sister that she has decided to end her loveless marriage to her husband Charles, supposedly a Swiss national. He has been lying and living a mystery. What she does not know is that Charles is already dead. She returns form her Alpine trip to Paris, where she finds her apartment completely empty. She runs into inspector Grandpierre, who escorts her to his office. He explains that Charles had sold everything for $250,000 US (1.25 million francs) at public auction and tried to flee the country to Venezuela before he was killed on the train. The $250,000 is missing, and Regina is unable to answer the inspector's questions. Grandpierre gives Regina her husband's remaining items in a small Lufthansa flight bag. They include a wallet with 4,000 francs, a stamped but unsealed and unsent letter, a steamship ticket, and some personal items. Regina is stunned when the inspector produces four passports from her husband. He tells her that her husband's real name was Charles Voss, not Lambert, and he was an American, not Swiss. Upon returning to her apartment, she is surprised to find Peter Joshua (Cary Grant) waiting for her. She had briefly met and befriended him at the Alps; he found out about her situation in the newspapers and stopped in to help. Later Regina receives a call from the US Embassy in Paris, Mr. Hamilton Bartholomew (Walther Matthau). Meeting with him, he explains to Regina that he is the local CIA boss and that her late husband and four others stole $250,000 in gold (military payroll) towards the end of World War II. One of the men, Carson Dyle, supposedly was shot and killed by the Germans. Another was Charles Voss, who stole the cash from the others and vanished until his recent, publicized murder. The money remains missing. Bartholomew stresses that Regina is in danger because of the double-cross and the other three men are looking for the loot, of which she has absolutely no knowledge. Of course the cash still belongs to the US government. At her husband's wake are just three: Regina, her sister, and Grandpierre. Three unsavory men arrive at different times to examine the body lying in state. They are Gideon (Ned Glass), Scobie (George Kennedy), and Panthollow (James Coburn); the last one has a hook for a hand. Afterwards the three men separately threaten Regina; we learn (if we had not already ascertained) that they are the three payroll thieves. Before long, it appears that Joshua is in collusion with the three x-GIs. Soon after, during Regina's second meeting with Bartholomew, he says that Peter Joshua is going by the name of the deceased Carson Dyle, who is after the money. Subsequently, when Regina confronts Joshua, he admits that he is tracking down the money, but that he is the brother of the deceased Dyle. He has made the three men believe that he is working with them, but he is not. He believes that the three men murdered Dyle because he was against the theft. But later, on the telephone, Bartholomew tells Regina that Dyle had no brother. After a physical confrontation with Scobie, Dyle claims his real name is Alexander. Later, when dead bodies begin to appear dressed in their pajamas, he claims he is really Adam Canfield, a gentleman thief simply after stolen money. By this time poor Regina is really so confused and does not know what to accept. The mystery begins to clarify a bit when our two protagonists and a surviving antagonist arrive at the open stamp market at the Jardins des Champs-Elysees. Not long after, there is a chase within the Paris Metro, and a final confrontation at the Colonnades and on stage (and below) at the Royal Palace Theatre. But no spoilers are given here. Suffice it to say that this is one of those lightly suspenseful and sophisticated, tasteful, and witty romantic mystery thrillers of the sixties. The Parisian settings are a plus. What great lead actors, and what a fine supporting cast we a have! And do the two leads not have great screen chemistry in their only outing together? The suave and charismatic Cary Grant is incomparable. Audrey Hepburn, elegant and debonair, has always been great as an innocent, vulnerable, woman-in-peril type. Can anyone dislike Walter Matthau? Finally, the Mancini musical score, as usual with the artist's tunes, is always appealing and enthralling.

    Charade was very thrilling as it kept me on the edge of my seat from the beginning to end. Regina is bombarded with constant threats due to her sudden trap surrounded my money, misconception, and murder. She has no choice but to put her life in danger as she searches for the truth and constantly questions who she can trust. Stanley Donen keeps the audience entertained with the combination of dark lighting, loud eerie music, a cast of actors that portray every aspect of their character with absoluter perfection, and of course an intriguing mystery. It starts to even break the Hayes codes by including more sexual content and detailed murder scenes which also keeps the audience intrigued. I cannot really say anything too bad about this film, it was a somewhat slow at some points leaving me to drift off a little, but overall I would have to say this film is actually exceptionally impressive, especially for its time

    "Charade" is depicted just like a genuine game of charades. Cary Grant changes his name and acts out a different back-story every few scenes and Audrey Hepburn struggles to guess if he is telling the truth. Set in Paris in the 1960s, this charming movie is a hodgepodge of suspense, thriller, and romantic comedy. The dialogue is phenomenal; the witty banter between Hepburn and Grant is hands down the best addition to the plot  H: Here it comes, the fatherly talk. You forget I'm already a widow. G: Well, so was Juliet, at fifteen. H: I'm not fifteen. G: Well, that's your trouble. You're too old for me. Grant's acting is quite ingenious. While his character was hard-to-love (because you think he is the antagonist for half of the movie) his down-to-earth, charismatic personality shines through with a glint of his twinkling eye and the slight tilt of his chin after a sarcastic remark. Hepburn on the other hand, is less convincing. Of course it is impossible to take away her womanly charm, her over-exaggerated facial expressions are too much. She is being stalked by four men trying to kill her. I didn't feel like she acted scared at in the least! Instead, she personifies an aloof, innocent, woman that is head-over-heels in love with a man she just met-inappropriate for the circumstances, especially when compared to other movies in the thriller genera such as Silence of the Lambs. The music certainly added to the romantic and suspenseful moments of the plot. While I wasn't particularly ready to pounce out of my seat in the pivotal fight on the rooftop scene, the minor-keyed melody did cause my heart to speed up a few beats. Several ideas reoccurred throughout the movie. For example, male suspects kept dying in their pajamas, fake names and characters were repeatedly created whenever Hepburn figured out Grant's lies, and the "I am divorced" phrase was used in multiple scenes to toy with Hepburn's emotions. Hepburn is portrayed as emotional quite frequently. In many instances, when Hepburn is worried, she eats food. I can relate because many times when I am nervous about studying for a test, I eat food. Grant shared many similar characteristics with Hepburn's diseased husband. They were both used deception to get what they wanted and had multiple cover-up names. While the Hepburn and her diseased husband were never shown together, context clues indicate that the difference between Grant and her husband is that Grant stayed to protect Hepburn while the husband would have selfishly abandoned her. In my experience, when a man lies to you once he will do it again. If I were Hepburn I wouldn't have trusted Grant after I poked holes through his first cover. To get Grant to take a shower in her room, Hepburn screams and acts like there is an imposter in the room. After he finds no one is attacking her, Grant tells her "not to cry wolf." Grant cries wolf (tricks Hepburn) over and over again and in the end, Hepburn still sides with him over Mattheu. Before viewing this movie, I stereotyped all businessmen as greedy scoundrels that would steal money from individuals when given the opportunity. When the stamp seller graciously gave Hepburn back the expensive stamps, I learned that I should not judge a person's character by their occupation. I also would not have given someone a fourth chance if they had lied to me as many times as Grant did. Hepburn taught me that sometimes following your heart can turn out better than making decisions based on prior experiences. All romantic comedies end with a happy ending. Therefore, it makes sense since Charade is a romantic comedy, Grant and Hepburn will get married. A underlying message that I took away from "Charade" is that secrets are like money. Once you lose them it gets harder to create more. Instead of finding another way to become rich, the characters are fixated on getting the money back even though it is nearly impossible. Likewise, once the covers of Grant and Mattheu are blown, it would take one dense individual to believe in anything other than the truth supported with visual evidence.
