 <sinopse>
  Mel Brooks' parody of the classic vampire story and its famous film adaptations.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Another spoof from the mind of Mel Brooks. This time he's out to poke fun at the Dracula myth. Basically, he took "Bram Stoker's Dracula," gave it a new cast and a new script and made a big joke out of it. The usual, rich English are attacked by Dracula and Dr. Van Helsing is brought in to save the day.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It is one of the best movies Mel Brooks made. To fully appreciate it you should see the original Dracula from 1931, this is probably the reason most people don't like it, because they don't get the connection. Through whole movie I was laughing, never stops to make me laugh, even after 5 times of watching it, still feels fresh. Rivarly between Dracula and Van Helsing is one of the best things in this movie, their egos are so similar and they don't like each other. Leslie Nielsen plays his roll perfectly. Peter MacNicol deserved Oscar for his roll, he was top notch, for me even better performance than Leslie Nielsen.

    Mel Brooks, a 85-year old American director and producer genius. He has made many a good movie. He is the king of spoofs. I could write many pages just about how great he is, but I'm not going to, for your sake. This movie was a delight to watch in the time of all hallows eve. Leslie Nielsen always makes me laugh, whether he has a naked gun, is on an airplane, is the president of the United States of America or something else. He is a treasure. He is just plain awesome. He is gold! Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck are pretty good too. They sure do a more than decent jobs in this movie. To finish this I will just say this was a movie well worth watching, I recommend it, it is a good movie to watch especially on Halloween. I give it 7.5 stars out of a possible perfect 10. Arrividerci! Bon Soir! Buenos Noches! Good Night and sleep tight ;-) - Shevy

    "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is Mel Brooks' greatest/funniest film ever! Not only is the writing 100% pure genius, but every actor in the film is outstandingly perfect! Mel Brooks is the perfect Van Helsing - so believable yet so hilarious! What can be said about Leslie Nielsen that hasn't been said before? He was a comic genius! The scenery is gorgeous; the music is beautiful; the costumes are unbelievable; every scene is wonderfully perfect! (It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often.

Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It is one of the best movies Mel Brooks made. To fully appreciate it you should see the original Dracula from 1931, this is probably the reason most people don't like it, because they don't get the connection. Through whole movie I was laughing, never stops to make me laugh, even after 5 times of watching it, still feels fresh. Rivarly between Dracula and Van Helsing is one of the best things in this movie, their egos are so similar and they don't like each other. Leslie Nielsen plays his roll perfectly. Peter MacNicol deserved Oscar for his roll, he was top notch, for me even better performance than Leslie Nielsen.

    Mel Brooks, a 85-year old American director and producer genius. He has made many a good movie. He is the king of spoofs. I could write many pages just about how great he is, but I'm not going to, for your sake. This movie was a delight to watch in the time of all hallows eve. Leslie Nielsen always makes me laugh, whether he has a naked gun, is on an airplane, is the president of the United States of America or something else. He is a treasure. He is just plain awesome. He is gold! Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck are pretty good too. They sure do a more than decent jobs in this movie. To finish this I will just say this was a movie well worth watching, I recommend it, it is a good movie to watch especially on Halloween. I give it 7.5 stars out of a possible perfect 10.

    "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is Mel Brooks' greatest/funniest film ever! Not only is the writing 100% pure genius, but every actor in the film is outstandingly perfect! Mel Brooks is the perfect Van Helsing - so believable yet so hilarious! What can be said about Leslie Nielsen that hasn't been said before? He was a comic genius! The scenery is gorgeous; the music is beautiful; the costumes are unbelievable; every scene is wonderfully perfect! (It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It is one of the best movies Mel Brooks made. To fully appreciate it you should see the original Dracula from 1931, this is probably the reason most people don't like it, because they don't get the connection. Through whole movie I was laughing, never stops to make me laugh, even after 5 times of watching it, still feels fresh. Rivarly between Dracula and Van Helsing is one of the best things in this movie, their egos are so similar and they don't like each other. Leslie Nielsen plays his roll perfectly. Peter MacNicol deserved Oscar for his roll, he was top notch, for me even better performance than Leslie Nielsen.

    Mel Brooks, a 85-year old American director and producer genius. He has made many a good movie. He is the king of spoofs. I could write many pages just about how great he is, but I'm not going to, for your sake. This movie was a delight to watch in the time of all hallows eve. Leslie Nielsen always makes me laugh, whether he has a naked gun, is on an airplane, is the president of the United States of America or something else. He is a treasure. He is just plain awesome. He is gold! Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck are pretty good too. They sure do a more than decent jobs in this movie. To finish this I will just say this was a movie well worth watching, I recommend it, it is a good movie to watch especially on Halloween. I give it 7.5 stars out of a possible perfect 10.

    "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is Mel Brooks' greatest/funniest film ever! Not only is the writing 100% pure genius, but every actor in the film is outstandingly perfect! Mel Brooks is the perfect Van Helsing - so believable yet so hilarious! What can be said about Leslie Nielsen that hasn't been said before? He was a comic genius! The scenery is gorgeous; the music is beautiful; the costumes are unbelievable; every scene is wonderfully perfect! (It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It is one of the best movies Mel Brooks made. To fully appreciate it you should see the original Dracula from 1931, this is probably the reason most people don't like it, because they don't get the connection. Through whole movie I was laughing, never stops to make me laugh, even after 5 times of watching it, still feels fresh. Rivarly between Dracula and Van Helsing is one of the best things in this movie, their egos are so similar and they don't like each other. Leslie Nielsen plays his roll perfectly. Peter MacNicol deserved Oscar for his roll, he was top notch, for me even better performance than Leslie Nielsen.

    Mel Brooks, a 85-year old American director and producer genius. He has made many a good movie. He is the king of spoofs. I could write many pages just about how great he is, but I'm not going to, for your sake. This movie was a delight to watch in the time of all hallows eve. Leslie Nielsen always makes me laugh, whether he has a naked gun, is on an airplane, is the president of the United States of America or something else. He is a treasure. He is just plain awesome. He is gold! Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck are pretty good too. They sure do a more than decent jobs in this movie. To finish this I will just say this was a movie well worth watching, I recommend it, it is a good movie to watch especially on Halloween. I give it 7.5 stars out of a possible perfect 10.

    "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is Mel Brooks' greatest/funniest film ever! Not only is the writing 100% pure genius, but every actor in the film is outstandingly perfect! Mel Brooks is the perfect Van Helsing - so believable yet so hilarious! What can be said about Leslie Nielsen that hasn't been said before? He was a comic genius! The scenery is gorgeous; the music is beautiful; the costumes are unbelievable; every scene is wonderfully perfect! (It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It is one of the best movies Mel Brooks made. To fully appreciate it you should see the original Dracula from 1931, this is probably the reason most people don't like it, because they don't get the connection. Through whole movie I was laughing, never stops to make me laugh, even after 5 times of watching it, still feels fresh. Rivarly between Dracula and Van Helsing is one of the best things in this movie, their egos are so similar and they don't like each other. Leslie Nielsen plays his roll perfectly. Peter MacNicol deserved Oscar for his roll, he was top notch, for me even better performance than Leslie Nielsen.

    Mel Brooks, a 85-year old American director and producer genius. He has made many a good movie. He is the king of spoofs. I could write many pages just about how great he is, but I'm not going to, for your sake. This movie was a delight to watch in the time of all hallows eve. Leslie Nielsen always makes me laugh, whether he has a naked gun, is on an airplane, is the president of the United States of America or something else. He is a treasure. He is just plain awesome. He is gold! Peter MacNicol, Steven Weber and Amy Yasbeck are pretty good too. They sure do a more than decent jobs in this movie. To finish this I will just say this was a movie well worth watching, I recommend it, it is a good movie to watch especially on Halloween. I give it 7.5 stars out of a possible perfect 10.

    "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is Mel Brooks' greatest/funniest film ever! Not only is the writing 100% pure genius, but every actor in the film is outstandingly perfect! Mel Brooks is the perfect Van Helsing - so believable yet so hilarious! What can be said about Leslie Nielsen that hasn't been said before? He was a comic genius! The scenery is gorgeous; the music is beautiful; the costumes are unbelievable; every scene is wonderfully perfect! (It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

(It's so nice to see a bright, colorful movie instead of the typical black/blue/gray coloring that is overused in dramatic TV and horror films today.) Not only is this movie a perfect comedy but the serious scenes (like Lucy's death) are so sad and heartfelt. Not many films can combine comic genius and deep emotion perfectly. There are so many surprises in this film - we can never tire of watching it. This is one of our very favorite, most "quoted" films ever! Every character is memorable and quotable! Peter MacNicol as Reinfeld = comic genius! Harvey Korman as Dr. Seward = comic genius! Fiancees x 5 years, Mina/Amy Yasbeck and Jonathan/Steven Weber = comic genius! Everyone involved in this film should have won Academy Awards! "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" deserves a much higher rating than 10! (We have the awesome movie poster framed in our living room!)

    This Dracula spoof has many original laughs along the way. After all the recent Vampire movies it's even more funny. Typical Mel Brooks humor is laugh out loud and crude. The cast is good including Amy Yasbeck as Mina and Leslie Nielsen as Dracula. Mel himself plays Van Helsing. Peter Macnicol is good too as Dracula's helper. Love the mock English accents and the way they pronounce "Lucy". It's not as original as Young Frankenstein or as ribald as History of the World but it's got enough laughs. Surprised to find out it had bad reviews and wasn't a hit. Definitely worth a watch. I am a Mel Brooks fan and this one is about in the middle of the range.

    Dracula: Dead and Loving It (1995) * (out of 4) You'd think teaming up THE NAKED GUN star Leslie Nelson with comic legend Mel Brooks would lead to an outright laugh riot but sadly that wasn't the case as this film really delivers the part of the title that reads dead. In the film Nelson plays Count Dracula who comes to town seeking new victims but Van Helsing (Brooks) is on hand to try and destroy him. Those walking into this expecting YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN type of laughs are certainly going to be disappointing because even the unfunniest moments of that film are still much better than the best parts of this. It's really shocking to see how many of the laughs fall flat on their face because there's no doubt that everyone involved was putting up an effort to try and get something funny on screen. I think the biggest problem is that time simply snuck up on Brooks to where his brand of humor just wasn't good enough anymore. I mean, films like THE NAKED GUN and AIRPLANE pretty much changed comedy and I guess it should come as no shock that Brooks' films started to suffer around this point. This film here follows the Dracula myth pretty straight forward but there just aren't any laughs. Most of the attempts are so forced that the viewer just sits there shaking his head wondering why no one realized this thing wasn't working. Check out the scene where Reinfeld arrives in the town full of scared people who warn him against meeting Dracula. The "humor" from this scene comes from a woman doing strange noises with her voice. Not funny. The majority of the laugh attempts are just flat on all levels with just a couple actually working. The stake-through-the-heart sequence manages to get a laugh as well as a insect scene at breakfast. Performances are decent at best but you really can't blame them when they're working with material that just doesn't work. Dracula: DEAD AND LOVING is (to date) Brooks' last film as director and it's a shame he went out like this but at least he did give us countless classics to enjoy.

    In his last few directorial efforts Mel Brooks truly forgot what funny was. He completely lost the cleverness and vulgar hilarity of his best films like Spaceballs and Young Frankenstein and replaced that humor with utter silliness and cheap slapstick gags which have been done to death. The kind of comedy he employs in his later films wasn't funny before the films and it certainly wasn't funny for his films. Dracula: Dead and Loving It was Brooks' final film for which he sat in the directors chair for, and it is one of his worst. It's a spoof on Bram Stoker's ever popular Dracula story with Leslie Nielsen playing the Count. It's got the same idea as Spaceballs or Young Frankenstein but none of the same intelligence or wit. It's an unfunny sham and I honestly think Mel Brooks should be ashamed of himself for it. And who knows, maybe he was ashamed and that's why Dracula: Dead and Loving It is his last film. This is a flick that feels more like someone trying desperately to be as funny as Mel Brooks rather than Mel Brooks himself. It has remnants of all the same gags we've seen in Brooks' more classic films, but it ruins them with one silly gag after another. Obviously it's supposed to be silly, stupid, and over-the-top, but it's also supposed to be funny... and it's not. I laughed once or twice during the ninety minutes of stupidity this film has to offer, and those laughs mostly came from places where I could see the old Mel Brooks. I'm not talking about physically seeing Mel Brooks because you do see him in the film as he plays Dr. Van Helsing. Sadly, even his performance is dreadful. The only decent performance of the film would have to be Leslie Nielsen's portrayal of Count Dracula, as he certainly tries his best to make the most out of an awful script. I don't know if I could have asked for a better actor to play the Count in a spoof version of the story, but I certainly could have asked for everything else to be far better. Now, I understand that not every Mel Brooks film is going to be Blazing Saddles, but they all could have at least been decent. Dracula: Dead and Loving It is just terrible.

    While this skewering of the Dracula mythology and the various cinematic interpretations of the story never achieves the kind of crazy heights of "Blazing Saddles" or "Young Frankenstein", it still shows that Brooks still had it in him to come up with some great, gut busting scenes. Being a genuine horror fan as well as a comedy legend, he and his team of collaborators do go to great lengths to give this film the proper look, and it's a colourful, stylish looking movie, going with the idea that the composer wasn't in on the joke and featuring a score by Hummie Mann that's full of foreboding. Leslie Nielsen is the pratfalling prince of darkness who is set up quite well early on when he comments on the "Children of the Night" and "the mess they make" - and then promptly slips in such a mess. He's a delight as always, with wonderful support by a bunch of actors who mug for all they're worth, especially Peter MacNicol as the loony, bug munching Renfield and veteran Brooks colleague Harvey Korman, who in his performance as Dr. Seward, does an amusing impression of the actor Nigel Bruce. Brooks himself, in fine hammy form, plays the part of the intrepid Van Helsing. Lysette Anthony and Amy Yasbeck are both quite ravishing as Lucy and Mina respectively, with Steven Weber as a prudish and uptight Jonathan Harker, and Mark Blankfield, Megan Cavanagh, and Clive Revill doing well in smaller roles. Cameos include Avery Schreiber, Chuck McCann, co-screenwriter Rudy De Luca, Charlie Callas, and the wonderful Anne Bancroft paying tribute to Maria Ouspenskaya in her brief bit. Standout scenes include the staking of Lucy (Van Helsing stays well out of the way for good reason), the breakfast sequence with MacNicol and Korman, which is particularly priceless, and the scene where Dracula is trying to manipulate both Mina and Essie and not having much success. A snappily paced movie leading to a fairly big finish, "Dracula: Dead and Loving It" is good entertainment as Brooks comedies go, and even gives its principal cast members the kind of "curtain call" at the end that we don't see in movies that often. Seven out of 10.

    Dracula introduces himself to his new neighbors: Doctor Seward, owner of the asylum where Renfield is being held, and a believer in enemas as a sovereign remedy for mental illness; Seward's assistant, Jonathan Harker; Seward's beautiful daughter Mina; and Seward's ward, the equally pretty Lucy. Dracula flirts with Lucy and, later that night, he feeds on her blood. The next day, Mina discovers Lucy still in bed late in the morning, looking strangely pale. Seward, puzzled by the odd puncture marks on her throat, calls in an expert on obscure diseases, Dr. Abraham Van Helsing. Van Helsing is convinced that Dracula is a vampire and that they must destroy him before he gets to Mina next. Dracula: Dead and Loving It may be a bit silly at times, but seriously, you can't help but laugh. It's certainly a lot better then most spoof movies today. How could you not love Leslie Nielson as Dracula? He was so hilarious, but who truly stole the show? Peter MacNicol as Reinfield, I can't tell you how hard he made me laugh, if one laugh supposedly makes you loose 3 calories, I think I lost 15,000 calories with just his scenes. Reinfield being seduced by Dracula's brides, him trying to save Dracula's coffin on the ship from hitting the walls back and forth, him sneaking under Lucy's bed sheets to peak at her, to the ending, actually every scene with him is non stop laughs. I don't care what people think, I'm not comparing, I think this is a very funny movie and is just a blast to watch, if you don't laugh while watching this movie, you're not invited to my parties, you party pooper!

    DD&LI works for me because Mel Brooks doesn't actually make fun of the cinematographic myth of Dracula, HE PAYS HOMAGE TO IT INSTEAD by relying not on ridiculing some of the "technical" shortcomings of the original tale in its various incarnations  which would be easy shots for any modern day wise a@&  but instead by extracting the humorous flavor of some of the situations, including of course the more risqu&eacute; ones, as extrapolated for the contemporary audience. Leslie Nielsen seems to take a slightly perverse pleasure at embodying the cinematic Dracula of Lugosi / Oldham, and it shows because Leslie likewise does not ridicule the character: he maintains its commanding stateliness nearly all the way through, including in the delivery of some of the classic lines or variations thereof. True, some of the language jokes are run into the ground (no pun intended!) a bit, and probably don't survive further viewings. But this shortcoming is certainly balanced, for instance, by the incredibly creepy and funny - almost majestically hysterical at times - performance of Peter MacNicol as Renfield! By some gorgeous sets (REAL sets, as mentioned by another reviewer) and wardrobes! And the duo dance scene with the mirror trick, which is extremely well done (although the spectators in it should have been more startled, and earlier on too), including the casting and direction of the stuntman doing the Count.

    I honestly can't understand why not as many people like this movie as they do some other late Mel Brooks films (Robin Hood: Men In Tights, Life Stinks). He's always been a great comedian and i collected all of his films about a month ago. I had already seen Spaceballs, then i watched this before tracking down the DVD (which was damn hard, i found a German version for $15). I was drawn to this movie when i discovered i knew nearly all of the main cast from Blazing Saddles (which i had just loaned the DVD of), Wings, Ghostbusters II or The Naked Gun movies. The only one i don't know is Lysette Anthony (and i'm about to buy a movie that features her anyway). The jokes can sometimes be seen from a mile away, but they'll still make you crack up. Some people have a 15 minute rule where if its not good after 15 minutes, they switch off. The rule for this is if you can't find it for a cheap price after 15 minutes, give it another 15 minutes. Then go for the expensive one.
