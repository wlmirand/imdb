    Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return. Whether or not you believe the stories are true, " The Amityville Horror" provides good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death. Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. "The Amityville Horror" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

    Some people need a lesson on spooky houses. For John Baxter(Tony Roberts), it's an experience he will never forget! John is a reporter who is out to debunk the myth about the infamous house in Amityville. During the so-called seance in that place once owned by man who would later die after giving it to the reporter. Once he got the place, his partner discovers the horror of it, and would never return. The daughter (Lori Loughlin, before "Full House") gets a room, and have her friends to a seance with a homemade Ouija board. Following that, she would later lose her life in a boating accident. And they did find the source of the evil: A demon! If the house was that evil, why didn't they destroy it in the first place. With all the skeptics running around, that's always the thing. Evil houses especially the one in Long Island, should have blocked off, not used as a tourist attraction. Better yet, not used for settling in. Its history is so bad it should have been condemned. Nice movie there, a little bit on the silly side though. 2 out of 5 stars

    Amityville 3 (1983) * 1/2 (out of 4) Due to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and producer Dino DeLaurentis, this third film in the AMITYVILLE series wasn't allowed to be considered a "sequel" (WTF??) so there's not much mention of the original events portrayed in the previous two films. This "new" story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment.

    Amityville 3-D takes us once again to the infamous haunted house where evil surrounds all who enter. In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the "true" stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II. The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time. The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly. It didn't do well at the box office, which is why the rest of the sequels were made for TV and straight to video. 4/10

    Expectations were low to begin with and were even lower when finished viewing. The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot: writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

    A reporter moves into the haunted house and is tormented by the evil within. Boring and stupid , this film might as well have been not made as nothing really happens apart from one or two supernatural occurrences but anyone with half a braincell would predict what would happen in them and this makes the result ineffective and not scary in the least. The only exciting part comes at the very end where a demon pops up out of a well in the basement ( discovered in the first film ) and for some absurd reason leads the house to explode this part is well pulled off but last about a minute and doesn't make up for the garbage that makes up most of the film. Not worth buying or watching.

    I Will start of with the plot Skeptical journalist John Baxter and photographer Melanieexpose a fraudulent medium who is operating in the infamous Amityville haunted house. Then John surprises Melanie by deciding to buy the house and live in it. John's estranged wife, Nancy , is also surprised, then disturbed, when John encourages their daughter, Susan , to visit. The house attacks visitors with horrors that include insects and extreme cold and heat. Eventually, parapsychologist Eliot West comes to investigate. I remember seeing this movie for the first time few years ago. there was only one scene that always stood out to me, it was scene where mother see her daughter go to her room unaware that she had just drowned, this was only scene I could remember. I just re-watch this movie about week or so ago, I did seem to like it a lot better then the first time around and this time I could tell which part were for the 3D effect even in 2D, next time I will see this movie in 3D. First movie was okay, a tad over-hyped and the second was really good, which I think is very underrated and this movie is really dull, this movie had nothing going for it, there no scary or creepy moment in this movie, it just felt flat from start to the end, like there no real story in it however it did pick up near the end with the explosions, which were really well done, those were okay scenes and the was really enjoyed watching and acting was really good as well from the whole cast. I will need to see this movie in 3D next time but without the 3D effect I am going give this movie a 4 out of 10

    The Amityville house once again wreaks havoc on anyone silly enough to spend time within its walls. But this time, its murderous days might be numbered. After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II: The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!

Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

    A reporter moves into the haunted house and is tormented by the evil within. Boring and stupid , this film might as well have been not made as nothing really happens apart from one or two supernatural occurrences but anyone with half a braincell would predict what would happen in them and this makes the result ineffective and not scary in the least. The only exciting part comes at the very end where a demon pops up out of a well in the basement ( discovered in the first film ) and for some absurd reason leads the house to explode this part is well pulled off but last about a minute and doesn't make up for the garbage that makes up most of the film. Not worth buying or watching.

    I Will start of with the plot Skeptical journalist John Baxter and photographer Melanieexpose a fraudulent medium who is operating in the infamous Amityville haunted house. Then John surprises Melanie by deciding to buy the house and live in it. John's estranged wife, Nancy , is also surprised, then disturbed, when John encourages their daughter, Susan , to visit. The house attacks visitors with horrors that include insects and extreme cold and heat. Eventually, parapsychologist Eliot West comes to investigate. I remember seeing this movie for the first time few years ago. there was only one scene that always stood out to me, it was scene where mother see her daughter go to her room unaware that she had just drowned, this was only scene I could remember. I just re-watch this movie about week or so ago, I did seem to like it a lot better then the first time around and this time I could tell which part were for the 3D effect even in 2D, next time I will see this movie in 3D. First movie was okay, a tad over-hyped and the second was really good, which I think is very underrated and this movie is really dull, this movie had nothing going for it, there no scary or creepy moment in this movie, it just felt flat from start to the end, like there no real story in it however it did pick up near the end with the explosions, which were really well done, those were okay scenes and the was really enjoyed watching and acting was really good as well from the whole cast. I will need to see this movie in 3D next time but without the 3D effect I am going give this movie a 4 out of 10

    The Amityville house once again wreaks havoc on anyone silly enough to spend time within its walls. But this time, its murderous days might be numbered. After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II: The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!

    Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return. Whether or not you believe the stories are true, " The Amityville Horror" provides good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death. Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. "The Amityville Horror" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

    Some people need a lesson on spooky houses. For John Baxter(Tony Roberts), it's an experience he will never forget! John is a reporter who is out to debunk the myth about the infamous house in Amityville. During the so-called seance in that place once owned by man who would later die after giving it to the reporter. Once he got the place, his partner discovers the horror of it, and would never return. The daughter (Lori Loughlin, before "Full House") gets a room, and have her friends to a seance with a homemade Ouija board. Following that, she would later lose her life in a boating accident. And they did find the source of the evil: A demon! If the house was that evil, why didn't they destroy it in the first place. With all the skeptics running around, that's always the thing. Evil houses especially the one in Long Island, should have blocked off, not used as a tourist attraction. Better yet, not used for settling in. Its history is so bad it should have been condemned. Nice movie there, a little bit on the silly side though. 2 out of 5 stars

    Amityville 3 (1983) * 1/2 (out of 4) Due to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and producer Dino DeLaurentis, this third film in the AMITYVILLE series wasn't allowed to be considered a "sequel" (WTF??) so there's not much mention of the original events portrayed in the previous two films. This "new" story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment.

    Amityville 3-D takes us once again to the infamous haunted house where evil surrounds all who enter. In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the "true" stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II. The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time. The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly. It didn't do well at the box office, which is why the rest of the sequels were made for TV and straight to video. 4/10

    Expectations were low to begin with and were even lower when finished viewing. The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot: writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk?

    Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return. Whether or not you believe the stories are true, " The Amityville Horror" provides good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death. Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. "The Amityville Horror" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

    Some people need a lesson on spooky houses. For John Baxter(Tony Roberts), it's an experience he will never forget! John is a reporter who is out to debunk the myth about the infamous house in Amityville. During the so-called seance in that place once owned by man who would later die after giving it to the reporter. Once he got the place, his partner discovers the horror of it, and would never return. The daughter (Lori Loughlin, before "Full House") gets a room, and have her friends to a seance with a homemade Ouija board. Following that, she would later lose her life in a boating accident. And they did find the source of the evil: A demon! If the house was that evil, why didn't they destroy it in the first place. With all the skeptics running around, that's always the thing. Evil houses especially the one in Long Island, should have blocked off, not used as a tourist attraction. Better yet, not used for settling in. Its history is so bad it should have been condemned. Nice movie there, a little bit on the silly side though. 2 out of 5 stars

    Amityville 3 (1983) * 1/2 (out of 4) Due to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and producer Dino DeLaurentis, this third film in the AMITYVILLE series wasn't allowed to be considered a "sequel" (WTF??) so there's not much mention of the original events portrayed in the previous two films. This "new" story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment.

    Amityville 3-D takes us once again to the infamous haunted house where evil surrounds all who enter. In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the "true" stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II. The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time. The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly. It didn't do well at the box office, which is why the rest of the sequels were made for TV and straight to video. 4/10

    Expectations were low to begin with and were even lower when finished viewing. The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot: writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

    A reporter moves into the haunted house and is tormented by the evil within. Boring and stupid , this film might as well have been not made as nothing really happens apart from one or two supernatural occurrences but anyone with half a braincell would predict what would happen in them and this makes the result ineffective and not scary in the least. The only exciting part comes at the very end where a demon pops up out of a well in the basement ( discovered in the first film ) and for some absurd reason leads the house to explode this part is well pulled off but last about a minute and doesn't make up for the garbage that makes up most of the film. Not worth buying or watching.

    I Will start of with the plot Skeptical journalist John Baxter and photographer Melanieexpose a fraudulent medium who is operating in the infamous Amityville haunted house. Then John surprises Melanie by deciding to buy the house and live in it. John's estranged wife, Nancy , is also surprised, then disturbed, when John encourages their daughter, Susan , to visit. The house attacks visitors with horrors that include insects and extreme cold and heat. Eventually, parapsychologist Eliot West comes to investigate. I remember seeing this movie for the first time few years ago. there was only one scene that always stood out to me, it was scene where mother see her daughter go to her room unaware that she had just drowned, this was only scene I could remember. I just re-watch this movie about week or so ago, I did seem to like it a lot better then the first time around and this time I could tell which part were for the 3D effect even in 2D, next time I will see this movie in 3D. First movie was okay, a tad over-hyped and the second was really good, which I think is very underrated and this movie is really dull, this movie had nothing going for it, there no scary or creepy moment in this movie, it just felt flat from start to the end, like there no real story in it however it did pick up near the end with the explosions, which were really well done, those were okay scenes and the was really enjoyed watching and acting was really good as well from the whole cast. I will need to see this movie in 3D next time but without the 3D effect I am going give this movie a 4 out of 10

    The Amityville house once again wreaks havoc on anyone silly enough to spend time within its walls. But this time, its murderous days might be numbered. After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II: The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!

I remember seeing this movie for the first time few years ago. there was only one scene that always stood out to me, it was scene where mother see her daughter go to her room unaware that she had just drowned, this was only scene I could remember. I just re-watch this movie about week or so ago, I did seem to like it a lot better then the first time around and this time I could tell which part were for the 3D effect even in 2D, next time I will see this movie in 3D. First movie was okay, a tad over-hyped and the second was really good, which I think is very underrated and this movie is really dull, this movie had nothing going for it, there no scary or creepy moment in this movie, it just felt flat from start to the end, like there no real story in it however it did pick up near the end with the explosions, which were really well done, those were okay scenes and the was really enjoyed watching and acting was really good as well from the whole cast. I will need to see this movie in 3D next time but without the 3D effect I am going give this movie a 4 out of 10

    The Amityville house once again wreaks havoc on anyone silly enough to spend time within its walls. But this time, its murderous days might be numbered. After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II: The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!

    Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return. Whether or not you believe the stories are true, " The Amityville Horror" provides good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death. Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. "The Amityville Horror" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

    Some people need a lesson on spooky houses. For John Baxter(Tony Roberts), it's an experience he will never forget! John is a reporter who is out to debunk the myth about the infamous house in Amityville. During the so-called seance in that place once owned by man who would later die after giving it to the reporter. Once he got the place, his partner discovers the horror of it, and would never return. The daughter (Lori Loughlin, before "Full House") gets a room, and have her friends to a seance with a homemade Ouija board. Following that, she would later lose her life in a boating accident. And they did find the source of the evil: A demon! If the house was that evil, why didn't they destroy it in the first place. With all the skeptics running around, that's always the thing. Evil houses especially the one in Long Island, should have blocked off, not used as a tourist attraction. Better yet, not used for settling in. Its history is so bad it should have been condemned. Nice movie there, a little bit on the silly side though. 2 out of 5 stars

    Amityville 3 (1983) * 1/2 (out of 4) Due to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and producer Dino DeLaurentis, this third film in the AMITYVILLE series wasn't allowed to be considered a "sequel" (WTF??) so there's not much mention of the original events portrayed in the previous two films. This "new" story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment.

    Amityville 3-D takes us once again to the infamous haunted house where evil surrounds all who enter. In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the "true" stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II. The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time. The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly. It didn't do well at the box office, which is why the rest of the sequels were made for TV and straight to video. 4/10

    Expectations were low to begin with and were even lower when finished viewing. The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot: writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

    A reporter moves into the haunted house and is tormented by the evil within. Boring and stupid , this film might as well have been not made as nothing really happens apart from one or two supernatural occurrences but anyone with half a braincell would predict what would happen in them and this makes the result ineffective and not scary in the least. The only exciting part comes at the very end where a demon pops up out of a well in the basement ( discovered in the first film ) and for some absurd reason leads the house to explode this part is well pulled off but last about a minute and doesn't make up for the garbage that makes up most of the film. Not worth buying or watching.

The daughter (Lori Loughlin, before "Full House") gets a room, and have her friends to a seance with a homemade Ouija board. Following that, she would later lose her life in a boating accident. And they did find the source of the evil: A demon! If the house was that evil, why didn't they destroy it in the first place. With all the skeptics running around, that's always the thing. Evil houses especially the one in Long Island, should have blocked off, not used as a tourist attraction. Better yet, not used for settling in. Its history is so bad it should have been condemned. Nice movie there, a little bit on the silly side though. 2 out of 5 stars

    Amityville 3 (1983) * 1/2 (out of 4) Due to a lawsuit between the Lutz family and producer Dino DeLaurentis, this third film in the AMITYVILLE series wasn't allowed to be considered a "sequel" (WTF??) so there's not much mention of the original events portrayed in the previous two films. This "new" story has an investigative reporter (Tony Roberts) and his assistant (Candy Clark) busting a couple con artists working inside the Amityville house. After the bust the reporter decides to buy the house since he is separating from his wife (Tess Harper) and sure enough strange events begin to happen. I think the biggest question one must ask when it comes to AMITYVILLE 3 is why on Earth anyone would purchase the house to begin with. Not too long ago I read a pretty good interview with director Fleischer where he went into great detail about the production history of this film and reading his comments made it appear that the film never had a chance. From the pre-filming lawsuits to the various issues while filming, this movie seemed doomed to fail and it pretty much put the nail in the coffin of the franchise before it eventually got started again thanks to TV and DTV movies. The biggest problem with this third movie is that there doesn't seem to be a reason for it being made. I'm also not quite sure who they were making this film for either. The movie was rated PG and it's clear that 1983 was a time for slashers so you pretty much alienated the majority of the horror crowd by going with a clear movie. There are a couple death scenes but they are done without much use of special effects and none of them are overly thrilling. The haunted aspects of the story also come across quite bland and they're certainly never scary. The film was originally shot in 3-D but I could only few the 2-D version and it was rather strange to see that there's really not too much stuff flying straight at the camera. The opening credits obviously do and there are a few other moments but for the most part the film is perfectly viewable flat. In that previously mentioned interview, Fleischer also makes it clear that the majority of the people working on the film had no idea how to properly use 3-D. Roberts is an actor I always enjoy watching and while this material certainly isn't his Woody Allen glory days, I still enjoyed seeing him here. Harper seems incredibly bored with her part and I guess you can't really blame her. Clark has a pretty big role here but her acting leaves a little to be desired. The film is probably best remembered for featuring a young Meg Ryan who gets to show off that memorable laugh. There are certainly much worse movies out there but there are very few where you watch them and ask yourself what the entire point was. I'm sure money was the main goal but the producers didn't get that and the viewer didn't get any sort of entertainment.

    Amityville 3-D takes us once again to the infamous haunted house where evil surrounds all who enter. In this one, a journalist played by Tony Roberts buys the house. The minute he does, people around him start dying in mysterious ways. This was the first Amityville to trail away from the "true" stories of the Lutz and DeFeo families. This here is all fiction. Of course, many could argue that parts one and two were fiction as well. I actually enjoyed Amityville 3-D a bit more than part II. The acting in this is pretty bad all around. Meg Ryan debuts, but only has a few lines. Nothing much. The demon in the house looked sort of good (for a 1983 film), but we don't see it until the end. I have to say I would have liked to see it in 3-D years ago. 3-D was the big thing in the early eighties. Jaws and Friday the 13th both used that format around this time. The 3-D objects include 3-D flies, 3-D swordfish, even 3-D spit. The film moves at a very slow pace and I lost interest in it quickly. It didn't do well at the box office, which is why the rest of the sequels were made for TV and straight to video. 4/10

    Expectations were low to begin with and were even lower when finished viewing. The second Amityville picture gave us its rendition of what happened...sort of...with the Defeo family prior to the Lutzes moving in and then out 28 days later. Presumably this trash takes place after both of those incidents. You know you are in trouble when Tony Roberts is your main gate attraction. Trouble indeed comes, but first a brief look at the plot: writer for a cheap magazine called Reveal buys house cheap and things happen to people he knows. people start dropping like flies...for those that sat through that..get it. Yeah, I need some levity no matter how small the dose because I sat through a real bad picture. The story has no hold on you at all as things in the house just start to happen. First character actor John Harkins gets flies all over his face and dies belly-up(for him no small feat). Tony Roberts gets in a weird elevator miles from the house. Candy Clark, his friend and photographer, stays waiting in the house for Tony. A fuse is blown and she gets air blown all over her from the basement door. Tony gets home and she screams not to be touched in a truly funny(though not intentionally) moment. Clark later is burned to a crisp in a car. Meg Ryan and Lori Loughlin, both hot, look the house over when Lori's dad Tony is out. Meg talks about ghosts having sex. Yawn. Tony'ex and Lori's mom forbids Lori to go to the house. She does...and, well, things get even more bizarre, stupid, and wretched again. This movie has no real story. The special effects are constructed in such a way that every shot, whether it be a fly buzzing in an elevator, should look 3-d. Roberts as the lead had me laughing as he has virtually no acting range whatsoever. After a couple deaths he looks exactly the same. Like he just got through trading witty barbs(though none witty here) with Woody Allen. Check out the special effects at the end of the film from the water well. Phew! Who came up with that junk? This movie is poorly scripted, poorly directed, and poorly acted. It makes the second Amityville almost look artistic. A truly bad movie all around.

    A reporter moves into the haunted house and is tormented by the evil within. Boring and stupid , this film might as well have been not made as nothing really happens apart from one or two supernatural occurrences but anyone with half a braincell would predict what would happen in them and this makes the result ineffective and not scary in the least. The only exciting part comes at the very end where a demon pops up out of a well in the basement ( discovered in the first film ) and for some absurd reason leads the house to explode this part is well pulled off but last about a minute and doesn't make up for the garbage that makes up most of the film. Not worth buying or watching.

    I Will start of with the plot Skeptical journalist John Baxter and photographer Melanieexpose a fraudulent medium who is operating in the infamous Amityville haunted house. Then John surprises Melanie by deciding to buy the house and live in it. John's estranged wife, Nancy , is also surprised, then disturbed, when John encourages their daughter, Susan , to visit. The house attacks visitors with horrors that include insects and extreme cold and heat. Eventually, parapsychologist Eliot West comes to investigate. I remember seeing this movie for the first time few years ago. there was only one scene that always stood out to me, it was scene where mother see her daughter go to her room unaware that she had just drowned, this was only scene I could remember. I just re-watch this movie about week or so ago, I did seem to like it a lot better then the first time around and this time I could tell which part were for the 3D effect even in 2D, next time I will see this movie in 3D. First movie was okay, a tad over-hyped and the second was really good, which I think is very underrated and this movie is really dull, this movie had nothing going for it, there no scary or creepy moment in this movie, it just felt flat from start to the end, like there no real story in it however it did pick up near the end with the explosions, which were really well done, those were okay scenes and the was really enjoyed watching and acting was really good as well from the whole cast. I will need to see this movie in 3D next time but without the 3D effect I am going give this movie a 4 out of 10

    The Amityville house once again wreaks havoc on anyone silly enough to spend time within its walls. But this time, its murderous days might be numbered. After an enjoyable sequel in Amityville II: The Possession, which was essentially a rehash of the original but well-executed, writer William Wales is all too aware that a third trip to the well will need to offer up something different before the onset of serious deja vu. He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!

    Everybody knows about the legend of the Amityville House at 112 Ocean Avenue in Long Island, New York. A family moves into the house and the older son murders them all in their sleep. When he's apprehended, he tells the authorities a voice told him to do it. Another family moves in a year later and they're plagued with paranormal incidences. Things get so bad, they abandon the house and never return. Whether or not you believe the stories are true, " The Amityville Horror" provides good times for horror fans. Some want to revisit their childhood fears. Others want the opportunity to share the experience with their children for the first time and scare them to death. Upon watching the first two films again for the first time in over a decade, I realized a couple things. "The Amityville Horror" isn't as hokey as I remembered it. The last time I watched it, I was disappointed by how tame it was. I found it to be a satisfying watch now. Maybe I've come to appreciate its subtleness in the wake of so many graphic gore fests and torture-porn films.

He succeeds in his attempt, but not before the equally formidable onset of serious apathy. Events have moved on since Sonny Montelli brutally murdered his family in 'The Possession'. By now, everyone in Amityville knows the house's reputation and not even a lease no more expensive than a couple of food stamps can convince anyone to move in. So brings the big sea change from the 'innocence' of the earlier episodes - with no unsuspecting family slowly discovering their new home sits atop a gateway to hell, instead, the lead characters *choose* to visit the house precisely because it's haunted as a challenge to their professional scepticism. Soon, they become drawn into events even they can't explain. Amityville III isn't the only horror sequel to take this route. When you've taken the unexplained as far as you can before repetition sets in, the only alternative seems to be to bring in the pseudoscience and the university postgraduate ghostbusters, immediately puncturing half of the atmosphere. 'Poltergeist III' began this descent, and the problem in both cases is we already *know* the explanation is a supernatural one, so unless the determined sceptic is well-acted and satisfyingly dispatched by the very thing he refuses to believe in like Dr. Seaton was with Reverend Kane, it's not very entertaining. This, I have to say, isn't the only 'Poltergeist' parallel: the spectral loss of the main character's daughter, his efforts to get her back, the demon of the title and the film's climax all evoke Steven Spielberg's superior first entry in his trilogy - also produced in 1983. But Wales is aware that Amityville can't cruise down Exorcist Street a third time and so everyone who dies here is fully compos mentis. In fact, they don't even have to be in the house anymore. All it apparently takes now is for them to have visited the house at some point, and the building can then exert its malign influence no matter how far away they are. It's not an unreasonable approach, but the whole point of Amityville *was* about being possessed once you crossed the threshold. If you can die anywhere, how it is it then different from say, 'The Omen'? Still, it does allow for at least one fairly good death scene in a car - one of two in this film, the other involving an 'unexpected' ghost. The lack overall of decent death scenes is another of the film's weaknesses. Seriously, when it's time to bring out the killer bees, you either unveil Tony Todd and his leather jacket or you go back to the drawing board. I can't really say the principal cast stood out for me a great deal. Tony Roberts, the film's lead and its chief sceptic, spends a lot of time engaged in 'furrowed brow' acting while Tess Harper as his estranged wife plays a fairly sympathetic character whose concerns are justified, but she just comes across as annoying. Robert Joy looks as though he hasn't slept in a week (is it just the lighting?), but Candy Clark is a welcome presence, able to convey terror very convincingly and a highlight in one of the film's better death scenes. Annoyingly, Meg Ryan's character, who seemed to be around only to remind viewers of 'The Possession's storyline, survives to the end of the film. The film's atmosphere is bolstered not necessarily in a good way by some rather retro-sounding musical cues by Howard Blake (who recently walked in the air with the success of animated feature 'The Snowman'), sounding at times almost like 60s adventure - back when Richard Fleischer directed decent films like 'Fantastic Voyage', while at other times slipstreaming back to the modern sounds of 1983. It would also be remiss not to mention that this is the only Amityville to join the slew of films of the period that were propped up by 3D - presumably to hide the lack of a decent script. Thank god we don't see that kind of silliness these days. The sequences shot for the purpose are glaringly obvious, but then again, sections of the plot were clearly built around them, the aforementioned bee extravaganza being the key offender. I'm sure it was fun at the time. So three movies in and my favourite is still the second. The third really doesn't offer much by comparison by way of memorable characters, scare factor or death sequences, but it has a few key moments and just ticks over enough to hold off serious boredom. It really stands out for what it is - the idea-starved final in a film series that didn't have enough creative input to sustain it. It's either not at all surprising it took 6 years for a 4th effort, or surprising that someone actually went to trouble - can't decide which.

    The house on the hill seeks fresh victims. Yes, the third instalment of the much maligned Amityville series sees another gaggle of hapless buffoons venture between the four walls where, if we remember correctly from part 2 a young man slaughtered his entire family with a shotgun and the walls dripped blood. Suave wannabe writer John Baxter purchases the property for a knock down price (not surprised about that, to be honest) and moves himself and his teenage daughter in and, yep, it's not long before mysterious things start to happen: Voices, objects moving around etc etc. His daughter takes it upon herself to hold a s&eacute;ance with a bunch of friends, including a very young Meg Ryan, where she is informed that she is in peril. Shortly afterwards, she drowns. Or did she? Her mother swears blind that the daughter was with her moments before the alleged incident, but now she can't be found. Time to call in the psychic investigators, time to follow that pulsing light down to the basement and see what really dwells in the mysterious well. Could it be a big slimy monster? You'll have to watch it to find out but the answer is, of course, yes. It's all very run of the mill, using every horror clich&eacute; in the book, but it's not in any way terrible. It's not in any way frightening either though, but if you have an hour and twenty five minutes to kill one evening, you could do a lot worse.

    This movie is a sequel to the previous idiotic productions of the Amityville Horror stories, originally released in 3 dimensions with special viewing glasses for the theater goers, a hip thing of the 1970's and 1980's. As usual with Hollywood's evil ghost stories, there are many suspense scenes aided with the louder sound effects and the type of music that enhances the feeble minded one's gullible emotional responses. This particular story was built around a married couple's daughter whose soul has been taken or stolen, for lack of better words, by the evil presence that resides in that Amityville house that causes havoc in the residents' lives, their psyche, and their appliances, furniture's and walls! As I wrote in summary, it is idiotic, even ludicrous for anyone to take it seriously! A Pothead would enjoy a great laugh!
