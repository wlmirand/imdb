    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison.

Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10

    The makers of this prequel to 'The Amityville Horror' don't have a problem with borrowing ideas from other films, do they? Abusive Burt Young and his family move into the spooky house where the usual familiar and tiresome haunting formula occurs - blood running out of taps, pipes bursting by themselves, plates smashing against walls, windows flinging themselves open - culminating in eldest son Jack Magner becoming possessed by a demonic force, at which point the plot shamelessly pilfers huge chunks of material from 'The Exorcist'. The haunting starts too early, leaving no time for build up, and goes on far too long once Magner is possessed. A few atmospheric moments pop up now and again, but are soon stomped flat by the film's relentless familiarity.

    Let's start off with some boring facts. I know no one wants to read them, but they must be faced. Although this film is based on Hans Holzer's supposedly non-fiction book about the DeFeo Family tragedy, it is, in fact, screen-written by Tommy Lee Walace (hold your applause until the end please) and not to be taken so damned seriously. I can understand the realism confusion here. If this movie is based on a factual event and book (very much so promoted that way too, like its counterparts), then why change the names and what really happened? I'll tell you... It's An Embellished Fictional Re-Telling. In other words, much more interesting to watch than if they'd made the real story. Not to mention we wouldn't want anyone suing over misinterpretation, including Ronny DeFeo. If he's even still with us? It's a horror movie folks. It's made to be scary and entertaining. In my opinion it does both of those in spades. Creepy as hell, at least in the first hour. The pacing is break-neck, for this type of film, again, in the first hour. And what happened to Jack Magner. I know the old standard is you're only as good (or wanted) as your last film. And I think that's what it is. Mr. Magners performance should have been based on his part, but ended up being based on how much the audience seems to hate this movie. I also love how his character's name is Sonny instead of Ronny (off, literally by the next letter in the alphabet). This is one of those movies I pick to watch on a stormy night that makes my skin crawl. Keep in mind I own 4,000 DVD's and half of them are horror movies, so I have plenty to choose from. It's a film full of dread, a quality newer horror movies have forgotten about, and I truly miss and appreciate. Remaining truthful here, I kinda wish the credits would have rolled about 70 minutes in, instead of 105. The last half hour just seems tacked on to make it longer, and give the special effects people more to do. It's also a study in how guilty can we make the priest feel. Who, by the way, does come off as gay with another priest as his boyfriend. Although the ghost of the daughter that was killed by her brother confronts the priest at the end by asking if he wanted to have sex with her in the confessional. You'll note he never answers this question, he just sort of winces in angst as if wanting to tell her, NO, I"M GAY!" If that wasn't a spoiler this certainly is: I believe that after the priest asks the possessing demon to come into him, and it does (we know this because of his pulsating veins) he should have shot himself after asking God for contrition. They could have done it as a sound bite when the camera does its last pull-away from the house. It's not like this character gets used in future sequels. And I'm not sure a priest would want to live possessed by a demon. You'll also notice he was given a gun by the detective before taking Sonny out of the prison. So, if not taken too seriously and one lets the beginning creepiness just wash over them... and one doesn't base this movie on the supposed truth, one could truly enjoy this horror movie. You can't truly tell me that the disgusting trap door in the basement and the ghost POV doesn't effect the hairs on the back of your neck!

    Effective chiller about a strange house located in Long Island that causes creepy goings-on in a family . This is the second version about the infamous Amityville house with lots of screams and weird deeds in which a troubled family falls into supernatural terror . The night of February 5 , 1976 , George and Kathleen Lutz and their three children fled their home in Amityville , New York . Their living nightmare shocked the audiences around the world , but before them , another family lived in this house and were caught by the original evil . They weren't so lucky , this is their story . The flick starts when a family formed by parents (Burt Young , Rutanya Alda) and children (Diane Franklyn , , Jack Magner) moves to Long Island where is purchased a notorious Victorian home , their house of dreams but they find only devilish horror and full of nightmares . A loathsome lout with his family (the Montelli family in this film were fictional characters and loosely based on the real life DeFeo family) and hell breaks loose . The new home, which proves to be evil, resulting in the demonic possession of the teenage son (Jack Magner, mercilessly hamming it up as upsetting possessed young , this is his debut theatrical feature film of actor Jack Magner whose only other screen acting credit after this movie was in Stephen King's Firestarter). The teenager begins experiencing frightening and vivid dreams of horror . And soon the poltergeists make their nasty appearance originating a lot of unusual rattles and creaks before deciding to utilize its powers to possess the son and attack the family . Only the local priest (James Olson) can save him . And now a possessed son is plunged by demonic forces into supernatural attitude driving him to mistreat and beat parents and brothers . Meantime ,the priest is attempting to find out the bottom of events by ways of the cellar . The priest tries praying to vanquish the malignant spirit , staggering from room to room with the doors mysteriously slam . There happens a grisly mass killing based on an allegedly real life occurrence in Amityville that turns out to be a haven for demonic forces . The film contains restless terror and great loads of blood and usual poltergeists phenomenon caused by the curse and the ordinary ghastly shenanigans result to be the cracking pipelines , basement ooze ,icky stuff , and doors suddenly slam , among others . This is a throughly familiar retread of spirit-in-the-house formula with a father who buys the dreaded as well as haunted Amityville house and his possessed son ; being alternatively loathing and dull . It is produced with medium budget by Dino De Laurentiis and well recreated with high grade special effects that are frightening and horrifying to spectator . Based on Jay Anson's (suppposedly) non-fiction best-seller , though George Lutz wanted this sequel to be based on John G. Jones' book "The Amityville Horror Part II" ; however, producer Dino De Laurentiis, in conjunction with American International Pictures, made this sequel based on Hans Holzer's book 'Murder in Amityville". It's actually halfway decent terror movie that achieved enough success at the box office and it will appeal to ghostly and eerie events fonds . Competence at every level keeps this from being rubbish . Acceptable FX , the explosion scene at the end of the film is real , a highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used ; during filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house . A highly explosive chemical which produces flames that burn out instantly was used. During filming the effect reportedly backfired and burned the side of the house. The movie's setting takes place in the same house as in the original Terror en Amityville movie . The picture packs a colorful cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo and eerie musical score by Lalo Schifrin who also composed the original that will be used in the innumerable sequels . The motion picture was professionally shot , being American directorial debut of Italian director Damiano Damiani. The original &uml;Exorcist&uml; film (by Friedkin) spawned a wave of demonic possession movies that continues unabated today as &uml;Changeling&uml; (by Peter Medak), &uml;Amytiville &uml;(by Stuart Rosemberg with James Brolin , Margot Kidder and Rod Steiger) are two further examples of this sub-genre . Following a great number of clumsy , stupid sequels directed by Richard Fleischer titled &uml;Amityville 3D&uml; with Tony Roberts , Tess Harper , Lory Loughlin and Meg Ryan ; another directed by Sandor Stern (screenwriter of Amityville) titled &uml;Amityville: The Evil Escapes&uml; with Patty Duke and Jane Wyatt , &uml;The Amityville Curse&uml; or &uml;Amityville 5&uml; by Tom Berry with Kim Coates &uml;Amityville: A New Generation&uml; with David Naughton , Julia Nickson , &uml;Amityville: Dollhouse&uml; with Robin Thomas and other bad followings just go on and on attempting to cash in on the success of the first movie . However , recently is made a good new adaptation by Andrew Douglas with Ryan Reynolds, Melissa George and Philip Baker Hall . Rating : Acceptable and passable .

    Decent prequel for the most part. An improvement on the original in terms of scares but it's deflated by a poor script

    Set two years before the events of the 1979 film "The Amityville Horror", this prequel from Italian director Damiano Damiani sees the dysfunctional Montelli family arrive at the house at Amityville. The father is an absolute thug, who bullies the children and his two teenagers, Sonny and Patricia. The mother tries to make best of what the family has, and hopes that this new home could be a fresh start. However, it isn't long before the father begins to lose his temper and lash out at everyone. Sonny sits up in his room all day, and slowly begins to fall influence to the malevolent spirits which haunt the house. Patricia seeks help from the parish priest, Father Adamsky, who comes to the home and realises the demonic spirits which prevail within. As the family continues to fight, and Patricia and Sonny begin an incestuous relationship, it's only a matter of time before the evil in the house gets the better of Sonny and influences him to carry out the violence which the house demands. Was never really a fan of "The Amityville Horror". I always found it to be dull and lacking any real creditability as a haunted house horror film. Also, I do not buy into the true story behind the films one bit, because of the proved inaccuracies and inconsistencies in many of the books and reports which have been churned out over the years involving the case. The films themselves are inconsistent. If you paid close attention to the first film, you will notice how this prequel contradicts the opening of it. For anyone not familiar with the background to these films, they are based on individual books which were written in the aftermath of the controversial and bizarre murders in Amityville in 1974 when Ronald DeFeo murdered his entire family. He apparently went room-to-room and shot his parents and younger siblings. The man himself, now 61 years old, is currently still in prison, and does not look like he'll be eligible for parole anytime soon. The Montelli family in "Amityville II: The Possession" are based on the Defoe family. While "...The Possession" is a poor film, it's still better than the first. All technicalities aside, I will not comment on how accurate it is to what happened in that house in Amityville in 1974, as I have not read any of the books, but I can make a rational guest that it is fairly inaccurate. It's a rather mediocre film up to the hour mark, and from there, it rapidly descends down hill as the filmmakers appear to have just improvised the rest of the way. One of the scriptwriters was Tommy Lee Wallace, who directed "Halloween III: Season of the Witch" that same year. Much of the film appears to have ripped-off "The Exorcist". Scenes such as the attempted exorcism, the priest speaking with the demon via the possessed, to name just a few. The incest scenes were interesting to say the least in the context that they had me checking the DVD cover asking myself if these two were in fact having an incestuous relationship or if maybe they weren't related. It was all just so casual. The special effects, as many critics praised initially upon this films release, are quite good, especially in one nasty scene at the end. The acting isn't bad; Burt Young plays one of the most despicable characters I've ever come across and plays him very well. This would be the first of eight more films in what would be called the 'Amityville series'. The 2005 remake of "The Amityville Horror" was an improvement on the original, but I can't imagine that the others would be any good. In all, this might be worth a look if you really enjoyed the first film.

    I honestly don't view this film that often because there is a lot of REAL horror on the screen that makes watching, at least the first half, rather uncomfortable. I'm no fan of things like beatings or incest which happen in homes everyday, but the way this movie is presented, it challenges you to watch it. You are introduced to a messed up family moving into a house, perhaps with the hope that a change like this will make things in their life better. The reality is that regardless of whether this house was possessed or not, this family (the Montellis) brought it's own demons with it. After the first hour the deed is done, that any of us Amityville fans or scholars already know about since it is why the first movie happened. I wouldn't say it gets "fun" after this, but at least the focus shifts from a realistic abusive family to supernatural demonic possession and the priest's battle for Sonny's soul. Where the first half is horrific due to it's realism, the second half is terrifying thanks to great filmmakers. For me, this movie is similar to Ju-On (2002) or The Exorcist (1973) where as I'm watching some of the scarier scenes, I'm actually looking over my shoulder. The basement scenes are particularly effective in scaring the Hell out of the average movie fan. Most critics at the time panned this movie, but how many of them are real horror fans? Ignore them and buy this film whether you own the first Amityville Horror or not. Admittedly there are one or two special effects that might be called "goofy", but the majority of them blow away any CGI put on a screen today. For a horror fan, I would call this a MUST SEE!

    Remember that awful day in Amityville? In the movie "Amityville II: The Possession", it's like the nightmare has happened all over again. Only this time, it's to another family. The Montelli family have purchased a house which was so big, it was like a mansion. Then when they began to say grace at dinnertime, the mirror fell. What's worse, everything in the home began to unnerve the wife. They call a priest to bless the house. The house it self happened to be evil period. Family strife, incest between the sister and brother, and the presence of a demon. That evil being takes control of the older son, and he gets messages on his headphones to kill his family. At one night, he would grab the rifle from the gun-rack, and would kill his family . The story that would haunt Long Island for years. In order to save the son, the priest would have to perform an exorcism to free him from the being. I would say, it was a close call for me. I would have lived in that area myself. The son was the big victim of the whole ordeal here, finding evil, killing his family, and paying the price for being possessed. Just pray that you don't live in that evil place, the movie is worth the watch, but the house isn't! 2 out of 5 stars

    James Olson gives the performance of a lifetime in this underrated film that is, ultimately, about self-sacrifice as well as the ongoing battle between good and evil. When we term ''good and evil'' here it is, of course, the purest of goods (Christianity's vision of God) versus the foulest and darkest of evils - the devil. And Olson's character is the priest fighting the good fight; in a much more involved way than even those in The Exorcist. It is undeniable that this movie owes a lot to the latter, its predecessor in this genre that pretty much set the standards for this sort of thing. However, here, in great part due to Olson's performance, we get to truly feel for the character of the priest and we truly admire the sacrifice that he makes in the end (we warned you about spoilers - didn't you? However, you should have seen this one coming from a mile away...) Let us simply put it this way: after seeing this film, you will not think of priests as cowardly, frail dudes in frocks anymore! Jack Magner (not to be confused with Jack Wagner nor with Michael O'Keefe, whom he resembles considerably more) is equally impressive in the role of the possessed boy that started the entire Amityville legend. His performance evokes that of Andrew Stevens in *The Fury* but is ten times more believable than that due to various factors that would take too much time to elaborate here. Suffice it to say, this is a frighteningly convincing case of possession, if you suspend your disbelief for a second and ignore the few technical flaws, here and there, throughout this film which is, overall, extremely adequate and effective. Cast member Rutanya Alda (who was also in The Fury, incidentally) glows in the few minutes of screen time that she has. Most viewers will recognize only one other cast member though: Burt Young, famous for his supporting role in the Rocky movies. There have been a number of films made about demonic possession in the last few years in Hollywood - none were as scary and well-done as this one is in its simplicity and straight-forwardness. This is much more than some scary fare to watch on Halloween night: don't be fooled by the programmers over at specialty channels such as Space The Imagination Station - they actually lack imagination there. This film is *The French Connection* of horror films.

    Damiano Damiani's 1982 prequel "Amityville II: The Possession" is a strange follow-up to the original (and generally well-regarded) 1979 "The Amityville Horror." It sets out to tell the story of the murders that happened in the house one year before the original film, and I will admit, this is an interesting idea, as the first film did establish the events as mysterious and truly frightening, but this film has a problem It doesn't seem to be set within the continuity of the original film, as so many details are changed. Just about every detail of the murders are changed, from minor to major, and this film creates further questions that remain unanswered. And this became a huge distraction Why call the film "Amityville II" if it's going to disregard the first film? Better yet, why allow for a script that completely butchers the continuity? But lets ignore the complete disregard for series continuity and focus on the film for its own personal merits, shall we? The Monetelli family has just moved into the mysterious house in Amityville, Long Island. The head of the house (played devilishly by Burt Young of "Rocky" fame) is an abusive nut who whips his children with a belt and forces them to call him "sir." His wife is a scared, hurt woman, and his four children fear him. His eldest son Sonny is quiet and seems to keep to himself. After moving in, Sonny begins to receive strange, disembodied messages from the house through his headphones, and soon is apparently possessed by a demonic force that takes him over from time to time, forcing him to hurt his family and pursue a sexual relationship with his own sister. After the force pushes Sonny to murder his family (that's not spoiling anything, by the way, we know it's going to happen), a local priest decides to help rid Sonny of the demon that has taken hold of him, and that's what the second half of the film focuses on. The acting is, well decent. Even though his role isn't huge, Young is very intimidating and very flawed, and the actors who portray his family are good. Lalo Schifrin returns again to provide the musical score, and it is just as haunting as the first film. In addition, Damiani's camera-work and pacing is a bit better than in the first film- this movie does flow a lot better, and felt far less boring. And the script by Tommy Lee Walace, as well as the effects, are a step-up in the fright department this is a much scarier, more solidly paced film than the first, and it functions better as a horror film. However, there are a lot of problems with this movie. Even though the script has a better pace and is quite startling and creepy, there are a lot of problems with the storytelling. The film does move a bit too fast at times, and the characters are pretty underdeveloped. Also, whereas the Lutz family in the first film was likable, the Monetelli family isn't particularly likable. The father is a jerk, and the rest of the family comes off as weak and submissive. Outside of Sonny and his sister, the other four characters felt very disposable. Also, while the first half of the film felt true to the original movie (by that, I mean in terms of tone and style), the second half of the movie takes a radical left-turn, and the last half-hour felt like a poorly-thrown-together cliff's-notes version of "The Exorcist" without all of the scary moments. I'm pretty sure the script was written by Wallace after watching "The Exorcist", as there are some moments that are far-too-similar not to notice. Also, as I said before, the film doesn't have any real continuity with the original film, which makes it lose a point or two as well. "Amityville II: The Possession" has a lot of problems, but it still works overall as a fast, creepy ride, and despite suffering a weak script, the film is a lot scarier than the original. I give it an average 5 out of 10.

    Amityville II: The Possession is directed by Damiano Damiani and co-adapted to screenplay by Tommy Lee Wallace and Dardano Sacchetti from the Hans Holzer novel, Murder in Amityville. It stars James Olson, Burt Young, Rutanya Alda, Jack Magner and Diane Franklin. Music is scored by Lalo Schifrin and cinematography by Franco Di Giacomo. Film is essentially a prequel to The Amityville Horror that was released in 1979. This is loosely based on the real life DeFeo family who were murdered at 112 Ocean Avenue by Ronald DeFeo Jr. On November 13th 1974. In spite of mixed critical and horror fan reaction, Amityville II was a success at the box office and does in fact have a fan base that believes it is easily the best film of the franchise. Now that may not be saying much since the first film, which is often considered the best of the bunch, isn't exactly great horror anyway, but Amityville 2, in spite of its obvious flaws, does contain good ideas and moments of genuine spooky unease. The main problem with the film, apart from Alda's woeful acting that is, is that it cribs its last quarter from the most revered of horror films, The Exorcist. Even to someone like me, who isn't particularly struck with The Exorcist's popularity, can acknowledge that any sort of imitation of that films central conflict is going to pale in comparison. However, for those who like their horror to be about creepy houses and a haunting of some kind, then there is much to enjoy in this prequel. From the off the tone is set as we hear the creepy strains of cherubic warbles, the house, with its distinctive Dutch Colonial face, homes into view and then it's the introduction of the Montelli family, a family soon to be terrorised by one of their own after a demon is released and takes possession of the eldest son. Build up is standard stuff as a series of strange occurrences begin to unsettle the already unstable Montelli family (father is a brutish oaf, mother is overtly religious), particularly a weird animal drawing that presents itself on the young children's bedroom wall. Then once the demon identifies its target and begins its stalking process, film shifts from creepy haunting into violent terror, with the added kickers of an incestuous relationship and the introduction of a stoic bastion of religion courtesy of Olson's Father Adamsky. The effects and make up work seem tame by today's standards, but they are very effective regardless, and Schifrin has a good ear for tonal horror shifts. It's hardly a masterpiece for sure, and some of it creaks for the wrong reasons, but it hits the right notes for the sub-genre of horror it sits in. 6.5/10
