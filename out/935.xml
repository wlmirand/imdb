    There are a lot of great actresses here. Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Pauline Collins, Cate Blanchett, Julianna Margulies plus many many others. The women are imprisoned in a Japanese WWII camp suffering under inhumane treatment after having their ship sunk by Japanese planes. The different story lines can get to be too numerous. However the main characters played by the better known actresses remain center stage. Ten years before, the stories would be shocking and ground breaking. But after Schindler's List, that kind of inhumanity is no longer as shocking. And it seemed that this movie held back the most shocking visuals. For example, when the woman gets burnt alive, we are barely allowed to see anything. Or the beatings were all stage crafted. They could have stage a more brutal vision.

    The film is based on actual true events and was inspired by the reminisces of the actual women prisoners of war, many of whom became life-long friends after the ordeal. Fact-based recounting of a group of women who are imprisoned on the island of Sumatra by the Japanese during World War II and used music as a relief to their misery .During WWII a group of women are captured by the Japanese and struggle to survive in brutal POW camp in the Far East . Their confinement is recounted in unsparing and harrowing detail , as Irish/British/Dutch/Jew women find themselves interned for the long duration . As orders from Nipponese Army Administration are strict as &uml;Men and women will be imprisoned separately &uml; . &uml;To avoid punishments and beatings , the ladies should presume themselves to endeavor , with passive behavior not negative&uml;. It is an internment camp, where civilians are kept for no other reason than being of the wrong nationality , this happened, for instance, to Japanese civilians in the U.S. Meanwhile, Adrienne suffering a surreal and brutal experience ; she is cruelly attacked ; however , she attempts to lift the spirits of the inmates and the brutalized women. Later on , she creates a choir , but the film refers to the singing prisoner of war women as a vocal orchestra rather than as a choir . This P.O.W film centers women prisoners as its principal cast and subjects with a theme of utilizing music to survive the horrors of war . The final credits state that the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp . It discontinued performing though when about half of the members had died and the remaining survivors were not well enough to participate. The real-life first concert held by the women in the actual P.O.W camp was held on 27 December 1943 and the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp during 1943 and 1944. &uml;Paradise road&uml;(1997) is a good film set in Singapur , directed by Bruce Beresford with an all- woman star-cast as Glenn Close as Adrienne Pargiter , Julianna Margulies as Topsy Merritt , Frances McDormand as a Jew doctor , Cate Blanchett as Susan Macarthy and Jennifer Ehle as Rosemary Leighton-Jones . And special mention to Clyde Kusatsu as cruel , brutal Sergeant Tomiashi, 'The Snake' . Interesting and strong drama , being perfectly adapted by the same director Bruce Beresford , David Giles (story) and Martin Meader (writing credits) , also producers . The film is based on the diaries, reminisces and testimonies of Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey as described in their books, "Song of Survival" and "White Coolies". No weakest in the cast and few in the movie , which presents the women's Japanese captors as human and inhuman at the same time with clashing cultures included . Clearly there's much longer plot in this, but director Bruce Beresford concentrates on the passionate acting of Glenn Close . It's a taut psychological drama about physical and emotional survival focusing on the tensions between Glenn Close, soldiers and camp commander well played by Stan Egi as cultured officer. Crammed with emotive moments , the picture has a string of committed performances from Glenn Close Pauline Collins , Jennifer Ehle , among others . Familiar ground is trod in this prisoner-of-war saga , but the thought-provoking story and magnificent acting help sustain interest. Colorful cinematography filmed on location in Marrickville, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ,Penang ,Malaysia ,Port Douglas, Queensland, Raffles Hotel Singapore . Sensitive musical score , the music in the film was derived from the actual score transcripts used in the P.O.W camps which survived World War II. This superior though overlooked drama , is also laudable for a fairly portrayal of the enemy captors and being rightly directed by Bruce Beresford , this is the second war movie he directed , his first was Breaker Morant. Other films about women on concentration camps mistreated by Japanese military during WWII are the following : &uml;Three came home&uml;1950 by Jean Negulesco with Claudette Cobert , Patrick Knowles , and Sussue Hayakawa &uml;Women on valor&uml;(1986) by Buzz Kulik with Susan Sarandon , Kristy McNichol and Alberta Watson set in Philippines .

    I have seen this movie many years earlier, and now I can say that this topic about women prison camp during WW2 has already been made some decades ago. Let me talk about them: FIVE GATES TO HELL, SEVEN WOMEN FROM HELL and also THREE CAME HOME. So this movie is not so new... But it is a very exquisite film that is worth viewing. The performances are outstanding. We can also think of BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI. That's all I wanted to say about this feature. It's a shame that the director - Bruce Beresford - is not more known worldwide. He is a very effective film maker. But that's for another comment.

    During the first 30 or so minutes of "Paradise Road", one is apt to ask one question incredulously: "They're still making movies about WWII?" Not-bad factual story based upon the diaries of Betty Jeffrey, this occasionally brutal but gripping film has female detainees in a Japanese-run prisoner-of-war camp in Sumatra organizing a choir, which raises their spirits and even captivates their captors. Director Bruce Beresford stages the indignities of the prisoners for maximum impact, yet neither this nor the music renders the picture fresh (it won't fool anyone who has seen 1950's "Three Came Home", or half a dozen other POW dramas). Glenn Close, the musically-trained den mother of the pack (and choir leader!), looks great with hardly any makeup and in a closely-cropped hairstyle; it's always fine to see her at work, and one can perceive initially why she signed on for this project (the epic sweep of wartime, the nostalgia and female camaraderie), yet her character's hushed-but-stern sanity and reasoning gets to be a bit much (as do the divergent accents of the group). "Paradise Road" obviously gave work to a quite a number of Asian actors--not to mention talented ladies--but it's of a genre that went out of fashion decades ago, and nothing in it is special enough to warrant a resurrection. ** from ****

    Interesting but uneven tale of a variety of women captured by the British while fleeing Singapore during World War 11. They are taken to Sumatra and literally brutalized for the duration of th war. Glenn Close leads an impressive cast. The film becomes uneven when we see outrageous Japanese brutality followed by a scene of toleration as the women perform. Certainly, these barbaric Japanese lacked any form of compassion. By the next scene, the brutality is in full force. The lame excuse given by the commander of their internment camp at the end of the war is certainly nothing with nothing. It was interesting to see that a few of the women became prostitutes in a brothel for food and to escape the brutality. Their forming of a choir was certainly their attempt at Singing for Time. (Remember the television holocaust film-Playing for Time?)

    This is as great as almost any movie I have seen. I cannot imagine why it is not more known. There was not a single false note. The performances were totally right. The photography is beautiful. One reviewer gave the details of the actual historic event. And the Japanese in this movie are not as cruel. So I am guessing - this movie is meant to be healing. Toward the end there is an exchange between Glen Close and "Daisy/Margaret" - Margaret says "I can't bring myself to hate people. The worse they act - the more sorry for them I feel" In the end - it is forgiveness and redemption (not hatred) that are the message. The amazing strength of the human spirit to transcend.

    Paradise Road is based on a true World War II story of a boat load of women and children fleeing the imminent Japanese occupation of the then British colony. The boat is sunk and survivors made it to the shore of an island that was already occupied by the Japanese military, where they are herded into a brutal prison camp. Brutal World War II prison camps have been portrayed before, but this story is unique because to keep their spirits up the women manage to organize an a capella vocal group that performs classical music for the prisoners. The camp officers and guards join the audience. I disagree with critic Roger Ebert who found the story line to be less dramatic than it could have been. I found the story gripping from the opening scene of a British high society ball in Singapore in which the British elite expressed their prejudices about Japanese and their erroneous belief that the Japanese army will be no match for the British military. It lost interest only after the war's end was announced. The film ended at that point without going into what the camp was like during the 2 weeks after the Japanese surrendered but before the victors reached the camp. All the cast performances were very strong. Many of the cast had important parts and all gave very strong credible performances. Glen Close was excellent in what I would call the lead role, the concert organizer and conductor. Although the action takes place in 1942-1945, the film was made in 1997. The prejudices that existed in the 1942-45 period are included in the film, but the 1997 sensibilities are expressed in making the Japanese military roles multidimensional, rather than pure evil. The only sadist was the Japanese Captain who was a member of the Japanese equivalent of Nazi Germany's Gestapo.

    Decent acting and decent story equals decent movie. The movie is about some women who have to survive in a Japanese war camp and find salvation when they create a choir. It is a heartwarming and true story that rocked me to the core. The acting was superb. Cate Blanchett was great in what must have been one of her earlier roles. Pauline Collins was great in a role that constantly reminded me of Shirley Valentine and Glenn Close was also very good as the leader of the choir. Frances McDormand was also very good. My only problem is that Glenn Close has been in so many American movies and shows I kept being reminded of them every time she spoke an impeccable English accent. She pulls it off but I would have chosen someone actually English. Overall a very good movie.

    Paradise road One of the best films Glenn Close ever made ! The whole cast was outstanding, as was the filming and direction.... down to the last prisoner, soldier, or eaten snail... Why is this so good? The story line is excellent, the whole plot is excellent... you WANT to get into it. You feel everything that the characters feel in the movie ." Feel" is the key word. These are the feelings the movie evoked in me: I wanted to rally with them, cry, get angry , be afraid, not be afraid, escape, survive, hunt for food, rescue, protect. Felt pain, anguish and smelled the scorching of flesh being burned alive. Death, sorrow, hopelessness of getting malaria. I wanted to murder the soldiers and officers, one by one, and bury them in a deep pit in the jungle ! Fight back, sing, love, show compassion, show bravery, kill the general when he said, " the war is over ! Now, we can all be friends again". Feel the strength of over-coming all these odds, because of the unity of these strong women. Knowing it is based on a true story makes me wonder what atrocities were omitted to make this picture viewable, ( the horrors and inhumanities of war ). The entire cast is in total sync with each other. Close always plays her roles with the most believability possible. She is the character. You feel it. You believe it This movie evokes every emotion that one can possibly feel, yet you leave it with a promise of hope and strength, rather than sadness. Hooray for the strong women . A most remarkable production. I watch it every year, too good not to !

    There is a poem one of the women recited in the movie, while they were in the Japanese prison camp, containing the words "Paradise Road", and it and the title seem to refer to the process of dying, where you are going towards paradise. The movie starts in 1942, in Australia, where men and women are smug about being protected against the Japanese, even after what happened at Pearl Harbor. During an attack, the women and children are ordered away and back to Europe. But at sea Japanese planes attack them, forcing all to abandon ship. Eventually many of them are reunited in Sumtra, captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. They stayed there until the war ended in 1945. Glenn Close is Adrienne Pargiter who assumes a sort of leadership role. While many of the women resigned to their plight, she was looking for ways to improve their existence. One thing she did is organize a vocal orchestra, and they performed many times. Frances McDormand was a Dutch Dr. Verstak, who helped treat many of the ill. Cate Blanchett was a nurse Susan Macarthy. Very pretty Jennifer Ehle was Rosemary Leighton-Jones whose husband was imprisoned elsewhere. Julianna Margulies was Topsy Merritt. The movie really was about the survival of the ladies, many of whom did not, until the end of the war. A bit slow and long, still a worthwhile viewing.

    Paradise road One of the best films Glenn Close ever made ! The whole cast was outstanding, as was the filming and direction.... down to the last prisoner, soldier, or eaten snail... Why is this so good? The story line is excellent, the whole plot is excellent... you WANT to get into it. You feel everything that the characters feel in the movie ." Feel" is the key word. These are the feelings the movie evoked in me: I wanted to rally with them, cry, get angry , be afraid, not be afraid, escape, survive, hunt for food, rescue, protect. Felt pain, anguish and smelled the scorching of flesh being burned alive. Death, sorrow, hopelessness of getting malaria. I wanted to murder the soldiers and officers, one by one, and bury them in a deep pit in the jungle ! Fight back, sing, love, show compassion, show bravery, kill the general when he said, " the war is over ! Now, we can all be friends again". Feel the strength of over-coming all these odds, because of the unity of these strong women. Knowing it is based on a true story makes me wonder what atrocities were omitted to make this picture viewable, ( the horrors and inhumanities of war ). The entire cast is in total sync with each other. Close always plays her roles with the most believability possible. She is the character. You feel it. You believe it This movie evokes every emotion that one can possibly feel, yet you leave it with a promise of hope and strength, rather than sadness. Hooray for the strong women . A most remarkable production. I watch it every year, too good not to !

    There is a poem one of the women recited in the movie, while they were in the Japanese prison camp, containing the words "Paradise Road", and it and the title seem to refer to the process of dying, where you are going towards paradise. The movie starts in 1942, in Australia, where men and women are smug about being protected against the Japanese, even after what happened at Pearl Harbor. During an attack, the women and children are ordered away and back to Europe. But at sea Japanese planes attack them, forcing all to abandon ship. Eventually many of them are reunited in Sumtra, captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. They stayed there until the war ended in 1945. Glenn Close is Adrienne Pargiter who assumes a sort of leadership role. While many of the women resigned to their plight, she was looking for ways to improve their existence. One thing she did is organize a vocal orchestra, and they performed many times. Frances McDormand was a Dutch Dr. Verstak, who helped treat many of the ill. Cate Blanchett was a nurse Susan Macarthy. Very pretty Jennifer Ehle was Rosemary Leighton-Jones whose husband was imprisoned elsewhere. Julianna Margulies was Topsy Merritt. The movie really was about the survival of the ladies, many of whom did not, until the end of the war. A bit slow and long, still a worthwhile viewing.

    There are a lot of great actresses here. Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Pauline Collins, Cate Blanchett, Julianna Margulies plus many many others. The women are imprisoned in a Japanese WWII camp suffering under inhumane treatment after having their ship sunk by Japanese planes. The different story lines can get to be too numerous. However the main characters played by the better known actresses remain center stage. Ten years before, the stories would be shocking and ground breaking. But after Schindler's List, that kind of inhumanity is no longer as shocking. And it seemed that this movie held back the most shocking visuals. For example, when the woman gets burnt alive, we are barely allowed to see anything. Or the beatings were all stage crafted. They could have stage a more brutal vision.

    The film is based on actual true events and was inspired by the reminisces of the actual women prisoners of war, many of whom became life-long friends after the ordeal. Fact-based recounting of a group of women who are imprisoned on the island of Sumatra by the Japanese during World War II and used music as a relief to their misery .During WWII a group of women are captured by the Japanese and struggle to survive in brutal POW camp in the Far East . Their confinement is recounted in unsparing and harrowing detail , as Irish/British/Dutch/Jew women find themselves interned for the long duration . As orders from Nipponese Army Administration are strict as &uml;Men and women will be imprisoned separately &uml; . &uml;To avoid punishments and beatings , the ladies should presume themselves to endeavor , with passive behavior not negative&uml;. It is an internment camp, where civilians are kept for no other reason than being of the wrong nationality , this happened, for instance, to Japanese civilians in the U.S. Meanwhile, Adrienne suffering a surreal and brutal experience ; she is cruelly attacked ; however , she attempts to lift the spirits of the inmates and the brutalized women. Later on , she creates a choir , but the film refers to the singing prisoner of war women as a vocal orchestra rather than as a choir . This P.O.W film centers women prisoners as its principal cast and subjects with a theme of utilizing music to survive the horrors of war . The final credits state that the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp . It discontinued performing though when about half of the members had died and the remaining survivors were not well enough to participate. The real-life first concert held by the women in the actual P.O.W camp was held on 27 December 1943 and the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp during 1943 and 1944. &uml;Paradise road&uml;(1997) is a good film set in Singapur , directed by Bruce Beresford with an all- woman star-cast as Glenn Close as Adrienne Pargiter , Julianna Margulies as Topsy Merritt , Frances McDormand as a Jew doctor , Cate Blanchett as Susan Macarthy and Jennifer Ehle as Rosemary Leighton-Jones . And special mention to Clyde Kusatsu as cruel , brutal Sergeant Tomiashi, 'The Snake' . Interesting and strong drama , being perfectly adapted by the same director Bruce Beresford , David Giles (story) and Martin Meader (writing credits) , also producers . The film is based on the diaries, reminisces and testimonies of Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey as described in their books, "Song of Survival" and "White Coolies". No weakest in the cast and few in the movie , which presents the women's Japanese captors as human and inhuman at the same time with clashing cultures included . Clearly there's much longer plot in this, but director Bruce Beresford concentrates on the passionate acting of Glenn Close . It's a taut psychological drama about physical and emotional survival focusing on the tensions between Glenn Close, soldiers and camp commander well played by Stan Egi as cultured officer. Crammed with emotive moments , the picture has a string of committed performances from Glenn Close Pauline Collins , Jennifer Ehle , among others . Familiar ground is trod in this prisoner-of-war saga , but the thought-provoking story and magnificent acting help sustain interest. Colorful cinematography filmed on location in Marrickville, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ,Penang ,Malaysia ,Port Douglas, Queensland, Raffles Hotel Singapore . Sensitive musical score , the music in the film was derived from the actual score transcripts used in the P.O.W camps which survived World War II. This superior though overlooked drama , is also laudable for a fairly portrayal of the enemy captors and being rightly directed by Bruce Beresford , this is the second war movie he directed , his first was Breaker Morant. Other films about women on concentration camps mistreated by Japanese military during WWII are the following : &uml;Three came home&uml;1950 by Jean Negulesco with Claudette Cobert , Patrick Knowles , and Sussue Hayakawa &uml;Women on valor&uml;(1986) by Buzz Kulik with Susan Sarandon , Kristy McNichol and Alberta Watson set in Philippines .

    I have seen this movie many years earlier, and now I can say that this topic about women prison camp during WW2 has already been made some decades ago. Let me talk about them: FIVE GATES TO HELL, SEVEN WOMEN FROM HELL and also THREE CAME HOME. So this movie is not so new... But it is a very exquisite film that is worth viewing. The performances are outstanding. We can also think of BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI. That's all I wanted to say about this feature. It's a shame that the director - Bruce Beresford - is not more known worldwide. He is a very effective film maker. But that's for another comment.

    During the first 30 or so minutes of "Paradise Road", one is apt to ask one question incredulously: "They're still making movies about WWII?" Not-bad factual story based upon the diaries of Betty Jeffrey, this occasionally brutal but gripping film has female detainees in a Japanese-run prisoner-of-war camp in Sumatra organizing a choir, which raises their spirits and even captivates their captors. Director Bruce Beresford stages the indignities of the prisoners for maximum impact, yet neither this nor the music renders the picture fresh (it won't fool anyone who has seen 1950's "Three Came Home", or half a dozen other POW dramas). Glenn Close, the musically-trained den mother of the pack (and choir leader!), looks great with hardly any makeup and in a closely-cropped hairstyle; it's always fine to see her at work, and one can perceive initially why she signed on for this project (the epic sweep of wartime, the nostalgia and female camaraderie), yet her character's hushed-but-stern sanity and reasoning gets to be a bit much (as do the divergent accents of the group). "Paradise Road" obviously gave work to a quite a number of Asian actors--not to mention talented ladies--but it's of a genre that went out of fashion decades ago, and nothing in it is special enough to warrant a resurrection. ** from ****

    Interesting but uneven tale of a variety of women captured by the British while fleeing Singapore during World War 11. They are taken to Sumatra and literally brutalized for the duration of th war. Glenn Close leads an impressive cast. The film becomes uneven when we see outrageous Japanese brutality followed by a scene of toleration as the women perform. Certainly, these barbaric Japanese lacked any form of compassion. By the next scene, the brutality is in full force. The lame excuse given by the commander of their internment camp at the end of the war is certainly nothing with nothing. It was interesting to see that a few of the women became prostitutes in a brothel for food and to escape the brutality. Their forming of a choir was certainly their attempt at Singing for Time. (Remember the television holocaust film-Playing for Time?)

    This is as great as almost any movie I have seen. I cannot imagine why it is not more known. There was not a single false note. The performances were totally right. The photography is beautiful. One reviewer gave the details of the actual historic event. And the Japanese in this movie are not as cruel. So I am guessing - this movie is meant to be healing. Toward the end there is an exchange between Glen Close and "Daisy/Margaret" - Margaret says "I can't bring myself to hate people. The worse they act - the more sorry for them I feel" In the end - it is forgiveness and redemption (not hatred) that are the message. The amazing strength of the human spirit to transcend.

    Paradise Road is based on a true World War II story of a boat load of women and children fleeing the imminent Japanese occupation of the then British colony. The boat is sunk and survivors made it to the shore of an island that was already occupied by the Japanese military, where they are herded into a brutal prison camp. Brutal World War II prison camps have been portrayed before, but this story is unique because to keep their spirits up the women manage to organize an a capella vocal group that performs classical music for the prisoners. The camp officers and guards join the audience. I disagree with critic Roger Ebert who found the story line to be less dramatic than it could have been. I found the story gripping from the opening scene of a British high society ball in Singapore in which the British elite expressed their prejudices about Japanese and their erroneous belief that the Japanese army will be no match for the British military. It lost interest only after the war's end was announced. The film ended at that point without going into what the camp was like during the 2 weeks after the Japanese surrendered but before the victors reached the camp. All the cast performances were very strong. Many of the cast had important parts and all gave very strong credible performances. Glen Close was excellent in what I would call the lead role, the concert organizer and conductor. Although the action takes place in 1942-1945, the film was made in 1997. The prejudices that existed in the 1942-45 period are included in the film, but the 1997 sensibilities are expressed in making the Japanese military roles multidimensional, rather than pure evil. The only sadist was the Japanese Captain who was a member of the Japanese equivalent of Nazi Germany's Gestapo.

    Decent acting and decent story equals decent movie. The movie is about some women who have to survive in a Japanese war camp and find salvation when they create a choir. It is a heartwarming and true story that rocked me to the core. The acting was superb. Cate Blanchett was great in what must have been one of her earlier roles. Pauline Collins was great in a role that constantly reminded me of Shirley Valentine and Glenn Close was also very good as the leader of the choir. Frances McDormand was also very good. My only problem is that Glenn Close has been in so many American movies and shows I kept being reminded of them every time she spoke an impeccable English accent. She pulls it off but I would have chosen someone actually English. Overall a very good movie.

    Decent acting and decent story equals decent movie. The movie is about some women who have to survive in a Japanese war camp and find salvation when they create a choir. It is a heartwarming and true story that rocked me to the core. The acting was superb. Cate Blanchett was great in what must have been one of her earlier roles. Pauline Collins was great in a role that constantly reminded me of Shirley Valentine and Glenn Close was also very good as the leader of the choir. Frances McDormand was also very good. My only problem is that Glenn Close has been in so many American movies and shows I kept being reminded of them every time she spoke an impeccable English accent. She pulls it off but I would have chosen someone actually English. Overall a very good movie.

    Paradise road One of the best films Glenn Close ever made ! The whole cast was outstanding, as was the filming and direction.... down to the last prisoner, soldier, or eaten snail... Why is this so good? The story line is excellent, the whole plot is excellent... you WANT to get into it. You feel everything that the characters feel in the movie ." Feel" is the key word. These are the feelings the movie evoked in me: I wanted to rally with them, cry, get angry , be afraid, not be afraid, escape, survive, hunt for food, rescue, protect. Felt pain, anguish and smelled the scorching of flesh being burned alive. Death, sorrow, hopelessness of getting malaria. I wanted to murder the soldiers and officers, one by one, and bury them in a deep pit in the jungle ! Fight back, sing, love, show compassion, show bravery, kill the general when he said, " the war is over ! Now, we can all be friends again". Feel the strength of over-coming all these odds, because of the unity of these strong women. Knowing it is based on a true story makes me wonder what atrocities were omitted to make this picture viewable, ( the horrors and inhumanities of war ). The entire cast is in total sync with each other. Close always plays her roles with the most believability possible. She is the character. You feel it. You believe it This movie evokes every emotion that one can possibly feel, yet you leave it with a promise of hope and strength, rather than sadness. Hooray for the strong women . A most remarkable production. I watch it every year, too good not to !

    There is a poem one of the women recited in the movie, while they were in the Japanese prison camp, containing the words "Paradise Road", and it and the title seem to refer to the process of dying, where you are going towards paradise. The movie starts in 1942, in Australia, where men and women are smug about being protected against the Japanese, even after what happened at Pearl Harbor. During an attack, the women and children are ordered away and back to Europe. But at sea Japanese planes attack them, forcing all to abandon ship. Eventually many of them are reunited in Sumtra, captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. They stayed there until the war ended in 1945. Glenn Close is Adrienne Pargiter who assumes a sort of leadership role. While many of the women resigned to their plight, she was looking for ways to improve their existence. One thing she did is organize a vocal orchestra, and they performed many times. Frances McDormand was a Dutch Dr. Verstak, who helped treat many of the ill. Cate Blanchett was a nurse Susan Macarthy. Very pretty Jennifer Ehle was Rosemary Leighton-Jones whose husband was imprisoned elsewhere. Julianna Margulies was Topsy Merritt. The movie really was about the survival of the ladies, many of whom did not, until the end of the war. A bit slow and long, still a worthwhile viewing.

    There are a lot of great actresses here. Glenn Close, Frances McDormand, Pauline Collins, Cate Blanchett, Julianna Margulies plus many many others. The women are imprisoned in a Japanese WWII camp suffering under inhumane treatment after having their ship sunk by Japanese planes. The different story lines can get to be too numerous. However the main characters played by the better known actresses remain center stage. Ten years before, the stories would be shocking and ground breaking. But after Schindler's List, that kind of inhumanity is no longer as shocking. And it seemed that this movie held back the most shocking visuals. For example, when the woman gets burnt alive, we are barely allowed to see anything. Or the beatings were all stage crafted. They could have stage a more brutal vision.

    The film is based on actual true events and was inspired by the reminisces of the actual women prisoners of war, many of whom became life-long friends after the ordeal. Fact-based recounting of a group of women who are imprisoned on the island of Sumatra by the Japanese during World War II and used music as a relief to their misery .During WWII a group of women are captured by the Japanese and struggle to survive in brutal POW camp in the Far East . Their confinement is recounted in unsparing and harrowing detail , as Irish/British/Dutch/Jew women find themselves interned for the long duration . As orders from Nipponese Army Administration are strict as &uml;Men and women will be imprisoned separately &uml; . &uml;To avoid punishments and beatings , the ladies should presume themselves to endeavor , with passive behavior not negative&uml;. It is an internment camp, where civilians are kept for no other reason than being of the wrong nationality , this happened, for instance, to Japanese civilians in the U.S. Meanwhile, Adrienne suffering a surreal and brutal experience ; she is cruelly attacked ; however , she attempts to lift the spirits of the inmates and the brutalized women. Later on , she creates a choir , but the film refers to the singing prisoner of war women as a vocal orchestra rather than as a choir . This P.O.W film centers women prisoners as its principal cast and subjects with a theme of utilizing music to survive the horrors of war . The final credits state that the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp . It discontinued performing though when about half of the members had died and the remaining survivors were not well enough to participate. The real-life first concert held by the women in the actual P.O.W camp was held on 27 December 1943 and the vocal orchestra performed over thirty works in the P.O.W camp during 1943 and 1944. &uml;Paradise road&uml;(1997) is a good film set in Singapur , directed by Bruce Beresford with an all- woman star-cast as Glenn Close as Adrienne Pargiter , Julianna Margulies as Topsy Merritt , Frances McDormand as a Jew doctor , Cate Blanchett as Susan Macarthy and Jennifer Ehle as Rosemary Leighton-Jones . And special mention to Clyde Kusatsu as cruel , brutal Sergeant Tomiashi, 'The Snake' . Interesting and strong drama , being perfectly adapted by the same director Bruce Beresford , David Giles (story) and Martin Meader (writing credits) , also producers . The film is based on the diaries, reminisces and testimonies of Helen Colijn and Betty Jeffrey as described in their books, "Song of Survival" and "White Coolies". No weakest in the cast and few in the movie , which presents the women's Japanese captors as human and inhuman at the same time with clashing cultures included . Clearly there's much longer plot in this, but director Bruce Beresford concentrates on the passionate acting of Glenn Close . It's a taut psychological drama about physical and emotional survival focusing on the tensions between Glenn Close, soldiers and camp commander well played by Stan Egi as cultured officer. Crammed with emotive moments , the picture has a string of committed performances from Glenn Close Pauline Collins , Jennifer Ehle , among others . Familiar ground is trod in this prisoner-of-war saga , but the thought-provoking story and magnificent acting help sustain interest. Colorful cinematography filmed on location in Marrickville, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia ,Penang ,Malaysia ,Port Douglas, Queensland, Raffles Hotel Singapore . Sensitive musical score , the music in the film was derived from the actual score transcripts used in the P.O.W camps which survived World War II. This superior though overlooked drama , is also laudable for a fairly portrayal of the enemy captors and being rightly directed by Bruce Beresford , this is the second war movie he directed , his first was Breaker Morant. Other films about women on concentration camps mistreated by Japanese military during WWII are the following : &uml;Three came home&uml;1950 by Jean Negulesco with Claudette Cobert , Patrick Knowles , and Sussue Hayakawa &uml;Women on valor&uml;(1986) by Buzz Kulik with Susan Sarandon , Kristy McNichol and Alberta Watson set in Philippines .

    I have seen this movie many years earlier, and now I can say that this topic about women prison camp during WW2 has already been made some decades ago. Let me talk about them: FIVE GATES TO HELL, SEVEN WOMEN FROM HELL and also THREE CAME HOME. So this movie is not so new... But it is a very exquisite film that is worth viewing. The performances are outstanding. We can also think of BRIDGE OVER THE RIVER KWAI. That's all I wanted to say about this feature. It's a shame that the director - Bruce Beresford - is not more known worldwide. He is a very effective film maker. But that's for another comment.

    During the first 30 or so minutes of "Paradise Road", one is apt to ask one question incredulously: "They're still making movies about WWII?" Not-bad factual story based upon the diaries of Betty Jeffrey, this occasionally brutal but gripping film has female detainees in a Japanese-run prisoner-of-war camp in Sumatra organizing a choir, which raises their spirits and even captivates their captors. Director Bruce Beresford stages the indignities of the prisoners for maximum impact, yet neither this nor the music renders the picture fresh (it won't fool anyone who has seen 1950's "Three Came Home", or half a dozen other POW dramas). Glenn Close, the musically-trained den mother of the pack (and choir leader!), looks great with hardly any makeup and in a closely-cropped hairstyle; it's always fine to see her at work, and one can perceive initially why she signed on for this project (the epic sweep of wartime, the nostalgia and female camaraderie), yet her character's hushed-but-stern sanity and reasoning gets to be a bit much (as do the divergent accents of the group). "Paradise Road" obviously gave work to a quite a number of Asian actors--not to mention talented ladies--but it's of a genre that went out of fashion decades ago, and nothing in it is special enough to warrant a resurrection. ** from ****

    Interesting but uneven tale of a variety of women captured by the British while fleeing Singapore during World War 11. They are taken to Sumatra and literally brutalized for the duration of th war. Glenn Close leads an impressive cast. The film becomes uneven when we see outrageous Japanese brutality followed by a scene of toleration as the women perform. Certainly, these barbaric Japanese lacked any form of compassion. By the next scene, the brutality is in full force. The lame excuse given by the commander of their internment camp at the end of the war is certainly nothing with nothing. It was interesting to see that a few of the women became prostitutes in a brothel for food and to escape the brutality. Their forming of a choir was certainly their attempt at Singing for Time. (Remember the television holocaust film-Playing for Time?)

    This is as great as almost any movie I have seen. I cannot imagine why it is not more known. There was not a single false note. The performances were totally right. The photography is beautiful. One reviewer gave the details of the actual historic event. And the Japanese in this movie are not as cruel. So I am guessing - this movie is meant to be healing. Toward the end there is an exchange between Glen Close and "Daisy/Margaret" - Margaret says "I can't bring myself to hate people. The worse they act - the more sorry for them I feel" In the end - it is forgiveness and redemption (not hatred) that are the message. The amazing strength of the human spirit to transcend.

    Paradise Road is based on a true World War II story of a boat load of women and children fleeing the imminent Japanese occupation of the then British colony. The boat is sunk and survivors made it to the shore of an island that was already occupied by the Japanese military, where they are herded into a brutal prison camp. Brutal World War II prison camps have been portrayed before, but this story is unique because to keep their spirits up the women manage to organize an a capella vocal group that performs classical music for the prisoners. The camp officers and guards join the audience. I disagree with critic Roger Ebert who found the story line to be less dramatic than it could have been. I found the story gripping from the opening scene of a British high society ball in Singapore in which the British elite expressed their prejudices about Japanese and their erroneous belief that the Japanese army will be no match for the British military. It lost interest only after the war's end was announced. The film ended at that point without going into what the camp was like during the 2 weeks after the Japanese surrendered but before the victors reached the camp. All the cast performances were very strong. Many of the cast had important parts and all gave very strong credible performances. Glen Close was excellent in what I would call the lead role, the concert organizer and conductor. Although the action takes place in 1942-1945, the film was made in 1997. The prejudices that existed in the 1942-45 period are included in the film, but the 1997 sensibilities are expressed in making the Japanese military roles multidimensional, rather than pure evil. The only sadist was the Japanese Captain who was a member of the Japanese equivalent of Nazi Germany's Gestapo.
