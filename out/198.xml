    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

    As an ash sea. Love and errors, ivory towers and theoretically escapes. Social chains and sandy expectations. A young man - axis of small society. A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

    As an ash sea. Love and errors, ivory towers and theoretically escapes. Social chains and sandy expectations. A young man - axis of small society. A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here.

There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

    As an ash sea. Love and errors, ivory towers and theoretically escapes. Social chains and sandy expectations. A young man - axis of small society. A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic.

However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

    As an ash sea. Love and errors, ivory towers and theoretically escapes. Social chains and sandy expectations. A young man - axis of small society. A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense.

Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange.

To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible.

A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

"La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.

    Alright, so I grew up in America so maybe that's why this film was kind of confusing. Even with the subtitles, I didn't quite understand why Nikita was supposed to be assassinating people for the French CIA. Actually, I didn't exactly get what was happening in the whole second half of the movie. Maybe I should have gotten the dubbed (instead of subtitled version), not that I wasn't reading the subtitles. Okay, I admit it, I might have zoned out during the slow parts when they might have been explaining something. And the pacing was a bit off, I thought. Half the movie's done before Nikita actually kills anyone (for the French CIA, that is. She already kills a policeman in the first few minutes but that's it). If it was a Hollywood movie, she would have been out of the rehabilitation facility or whatever and would have started killing people withing the first half hour. And Anne Parillaud acted well, I guess, but she screamed way too much. I mean, I guess I would too if I was a drug addict who was forced to become an assassin. And in America, films usually have satisfying endings in which you find out what happened to everyone and all that. At the end of Nikita, you don't even know where the main character went. It was pretty weird. But it was alright.

    As an ash sea. Love and errors, ivory towers and theoretically escapes. Social chains and sandy expectations. A young man - axis of small society. A sentimental adventure, the sick and the good ways. A french novel about values and sentimental windows. Scarfs of past and future as Persian carpet. Anne Parillaud in skin of reed-character. A film about sniper rifles and decisions. About search of life sense and answers behind the words. Death as scrub. And the sound of things who makes measure of feelings. Fresco of a world, it is interesting for the art of director and for interesting cast. ...And, more that, for the final taste. For the traces of its parts - mirrors in fact.

    Who are we is usually either a very simple or a very difficult question depending on the situation. When people ask who we are, what do we say? What is our name, occupation, maybe we mention some hobbies. But what if they ask, "no but really, who are you?", most people become lost. "What do you mean, who am I? I told you my name and occupation." But I don't think our name shows truly who we are. I mean, there are a lot of people with the same names or the same occupation or both and they are still different. So what makes our identity? The main character Nikita is also faced with this question. After her crimes she is sentenced to death and later wakes up to be told that she will be enrolled into special agent training. That means she is dead to the outer world and belongs to the secret world of spies and assassins. So she has to create herself all over again, she has to follow certain rules, act in certain ways only to pass. Of course, at some point she is forced to change. She can't tell anyone what she does, not even her name. And that is quite difficult as our name and activity are usually the main keys that we use to define ourselves to the outer world. So what happens when you are stripped down from this luxury? Well, you become secretive, you have something like an identity crisis. You think you know who you are, other people think they know who you are, but those two do not match. And sometimes even the main character might become doubtful whether she is really who she is. All of us want to be different, remembered, we have our identity, and we never even think about what would happen if identity would be taken from us. What would we become? Constant actors or chameleons? I believe this movie greatly shows the development of character who is stripped down from identity and tossed into a new system. It shows quick change is needed to adapt, to create new identity. I believe it is impossible to be without identity. Even if there is an identity crisis the most probable solution in my opinion would be that the person would start creating a new identity. I guess it's in our nature. We have to show to the world: this is who we are.

    "La Femme Nikita" spawned an American remake and a television series. And, it's correct to say it's a bit of a cult film and a lot of folks like this film. Well, I liked it...but didn't love it mostly because of some logical problems early in the film. Still, I recommend you see it because the story is quite original. The film begins with a very violent and senseless crime. Some druggies break into a pharmacy and soon a bloodbath ensues. The police arrive and several of them are also killed. One of the druggies survives and is indicted on several counts of murder. Throughout the next 20 minutes or so, the surviving druggie, Nikita, behaves like she is either psychotic or possessed. She is nasty, violent and completely antisocial. Not surprisingly, she's sentenced to a very lengthy prison term. However, something odd happens--her death in prison is faked and she wakes up in a training center for assassins and spies. This is a neat setup but really made no sense. If the government was going to recruit assassins, a woman who seemed very emotionally disturbed and possibly mentally challenged seems like a bizarre and nonsensical choice. Making her less weird, whacked out and more obviously intelligent would have explained their selection process--and selecting Nikita seemed strange. If you can look past all this, the film get VERY interesting once she leaves training and tries to establish a dual life--a conventional woman with a boyfriend AND a secret killer! To me, the last portion was far better--and made much more sense. What happens next? See it for yourself--it's a decent little thriller. In many ways, this film reminds me of an earlier film "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins"--though, oddly, the setup for "Remo Williams: The Adventure Begins" was much better BUT the mission portion was terrible. With "La Femme Nikita" it was the exact opposite.

    Influential, as it has been directly remade (Point of No Return 1993), spawned a TV-Series, and imitated many times. Might even be responsible for the modern inclination to showcase "Girls with Guns". Although Film Buffs know that this is hardly a new concept and is actually a staple of Film Noir. This stylish and audience friendly Female Fantasy is not a great Movie but a very good French Film that has some Cool Artistic touches. The lead Actress is fine but some viewers may find that the script calls for her to display some overwrought tendencies that detract from her complex character by displays of emotional excess. That said, this is hardly a believable story but it is Fiction at its fanciful best. It bridges effectively between the Noir and Spy genres and it all makes for some fun. But Nikita suffers somewhat from too many scenes of waterworks. This ends up seeming a bit forced on the audience and is an overdone overture to elicit empathetic concern but is a visceral distraction. This is a heavy contrast to her Hard Boiled nature and could have worked better with a bit of subtlety. If you feel a need for a foray into Foreign Films with subtitles, this is a good one and no better place to start.

    It opens with a burst of violence as a handful of Parisian skinhead dopers break into a drug store and start smashing everything in sight under the neon blue lights. There's a shoot out when the police arrive. Shelves of glass containers explode under the fusillade. The bodies pile up, shot to shreds. Anne Parillaud, a gang moll, senselessly blows the head off a helpless gendarme. The editing is quick, the air filled with curses, the colors garish. In other words, it's an imitation of an American action movie. It was remade in 1993, as "Point of No Return," with Bridget Fonda in the starring role of the drugged-out psychopath coerced and trained to be a cool government assassin. Let's see -- that would make the later production an American imitation of a French imitation of an American action movie. A few shots are identical. Bridget Fonda is cuter than Anne Parillaud and sexier too, but she's not nearly Parillaud's equal as an expressive actress. Watch Parillaud's infantile delight when she dines out with her government mentor and he gives her a birthday present in the fancy restaurant. There's quite a bit of gore but not nearly as much as in most American action films of the 80s. After that initial shoot out, deaths tend to take place in singles, not in grand slams. Released from the Institute (or whatever the agency is called) and only drafted for occasional special killings, Parillaud begins to enjoy her freedom. She has an affair with Jean-Hugues Anglade, an affable guy with a kind but slightly goofy face. This generates a bit of jealousy on the part of her government guru, Tch&eacute;ky Karyo, who has developed a subdued yen for her. But it's just as well he doesn't get her. He has a face like a tractor with a steel plow attached to its front end. I don't know how well the chips fall into place from a psychological point of view. Parillaud is a real beast at the beginning, a maniacal puppet who tries to bite the ear off her judo instructor. She beans her mentor over the head with a crockery pot and he almost bleeds out. She breaks into wild dances for no reason. I would think professional assassins need to be something other than impulsive and unthinking. They need the soul of a tax auditor not the showmanship of a vaudeville clown. However, the Frog temperament sometimes insists on doing things upside down. Jeanne Moreau shows up as a tutor in the finer feminine arts. My God, what a face. It's made for the camera. She was never a Hollywood-gorgeous beauty but she was always magnetic. Same with Jean Reno, who shows up at a botched murder as "the cleanup man." There have been so many cleanup men in these kinds of movies that if I see any more I'll start to think they exist. This movie is a longie at one hour and fifty-seven minutes but it's not slow. The sets are perfectly done, from grand to ruined. The acting is professional throughout. The camera doesn't wobble drunkenly and the editing slows down after the first five minutes so that it's possible to tell who is doing what to whom. Worth catching if it's on.

    Anne Parllaud is Nikita, a reformed heroin addict and thief, who after a robbery gone wrong, has killed a cop and is serving a life sentence. The only way out is to become an undercover assassin for a covert agency, working for the government. The authorities fake her death and put her through a rigorous training program to learn how to kill efficiently and quietly. Her first job is to terminate a diplomat at a busy restaurant and the female James Bond proves up to the task. She meets Marco while food shopping and he becomes her boyfriend. He does not know about her clandestine activities. In another operation involving "Victor the cleaner" at an embassy results in his death and complications for her. Marco discovers her hidden identity and requests that she needs to change her life. Nikita is the female counterpoint to Besson's Leon: The Professional; though not as good, but still a worthy action film.

    Admittedly this is a slick and stylish film, but in between the high spots, I found it to be long on exposition and dare I say it, almost boring. What was never developed well enough for me was the idea that this punk teenager/cop killer was deemed suitable to undergo an intensive rebirth as a government assassin. What elusive ingredient was part of Nikita's (Anne Parillaud) makeup that justified agent Bob (Tcheky Karyo) to go out on a limb to mentor her training? That whole part of the story was a disconnect for me, and kept rearing it's ugly head every time Marie/Josephine went into a sob over one thing or another. I offer that bathtub scene with the co-assassin who panicked to support my argument. I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown right there. Well this one's been around a long time now, twenty years, and I finally got around to seeing it based on it's reputation, but I can't say that I was enthralled the way some of it's bigger fans on this board were. For some perspective, I went back and took a look at my review for that other Luc Besson genre film "Leon: The Professional", but that only confirmed my initial reaction here. The two hours can be spent better elsewhere.

    Writer & director Luc Besson's crime thriller "La Femme Nikita" served as the prototype for the gals with guns genre. Before Besson's seminal assassination saga, Hollywood had produced only a fistful of thrillers where females brandished firearms and displayed an affinity for violence that rivaled their male counterparts. You don't have to search far to see the impact that this landmark 1990 movie wrought on film and television. Hollywood remade "La Femme Nikita" in 1993 as "Point of No Return" with Bridget Fonda in the lead role and director John Badham at the helm. Later, two cable television series followed; first came "La Femme Nikita" with Peta Wilson from 1997 to 2001, and Maggie Q appeared second in "Nikita" in 2010. Along the way, Besson made "Colombiana" and countless other clones of "La Femme Nikita" have ensued. Believe it or not, this was Anne Parillaud's breakout role, and she won the French Oscar for her spirited performance. As memorable as Parillaud is as the heroine, Jean Reno makes an unforgettable impression as Victor the Cleaner who mops up the blood, gore, and bodies after a gunfight. "La Femme Nikita" qualifies as an exciting shoot'em up with Besson's slick touches, snappy dialogue, and swift pace keeping it engrossing throughout its 118 minute running time. He exploits his Parisian and Italian locations with an eye to exotic settings. Thierry Arbogast's low-angle photography contributes as much to the atmosphere and action as composer Eric Serra's brooding orchestral score. Ultimately, "La Femme Nikita" delivers more than knock-dead action and memorable characters. Ironically, the government converts a hopeless junkie into a responsible, intelligent, and sensitive individual who cannot function as a cold blooded killer even though she was recruited because of her anti-social, murderous disposition. This makes "La Femme Nikita" a worthwhile thriller than rises above its origins.
