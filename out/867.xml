    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    This movie is a incredible insight to one of the greatest pulp writers ever. Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

    What can one say about such a little known gem of a film as this one? It is obviously a labor of love for all concerned. I was so surprised to find this film that I just had to see it ASAP. Anyone who is a fan of true love stories, or of the early days of the pulp fiction industry will be charmed to encounter this story of one of the greatest and most original talents in the history of popular literature: Bob Howard. Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

    What can one say about such a little known gem of a film as this one? It is obviously a labor of love for all concerned. I was so surprised to find this film that I just had to see it ASAP. Anyone who is a fan of true love stories, or of the early days of the pulp fiction industry will be charmed to encounter this story of one of the greatest and most original talents in the history of popular literature: Bob Howard. Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    This movie is a incredible insight to one of the greatest pulp writers ever. Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

    What can one say about such a little known gem of a film as this one? It is obviously a labor of love for all concerned. I was so surprised to find this film that I just had to see it ASAP. Anyone who is a fan of true love stories, or of the early days of the pulp fiction industry will be charmed to encounter this story of one of the greatest and most original talents in the history of popular literature: Bob Howard. Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style.

But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

    What can one say about such a little known gem of a film as this one? It is obviously a labor of love for all concerned. I was so surprised to find this film that I just had to see it ASAP. Anyone who is a fan of true love stories, or of the early days of the pulp fiction industry will be charmed to encounter this story of one of the greatest and most original talents in the history of popular literature: Bob Howard. Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    This movie is a incredible insight to one of the greatest pulp writers ever. Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms.

Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.

    What can one say about such a little known gem of a film as this one? It is obviously a labor of love for all concerned. I was so surprised to find this film that I just had to see it ASAP. Anyone who is a fan of true love stories, or of the early days of the pulp fiction industry will be charmed to encounter this story of one of the greatest and most original talents in the history of popular literature: Bob Howard. Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    This movie is a incredible insight to one of the greatest pulp writers ever. Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one.

Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style.

Today his name has lost much of its original luster. It's easy to write him off as just another odd-ball who killed himself and good-riddance. But when you stop to realize that the creator of the Conan saga was at the time of his suicide the most famous writer of pulp fiction in the world, you begin to realize the importance of this story. If Howard had survived his grief over his mother's terminal illness, he would undoubtedly be ranked with names such as J.R.R. Tolkien and Stephen King by this time. After all, he did single-handedly create the entire Sword & Sorcery genre! H.P. Lovecraft realized the greatness of Howard's talent from the beginning, and became his mentor. He even tried to help him overcome his perverse attachment to his mother and keep him from the deep depression that eventually led to his demise. But he lived in Rhode Island, and could only write Bob letters. If Novalyne Price had not been away at LSU at just that time, she may have been the one to pull him through his darkest hour, and who knows what the consequences might be today? Of course all such speculation is at last futile, and I intend no blame or unkindness toward Novalyne Price Ellis. What happened, happened for a reason only God knows. But I find it fascinating to think about. As a true love story it is one of the most unusual and interesting you will ever encounter. D'Onofrio is masterful as usual in juggling all the complexities of Howard's personality. Zellweger is perfect as the ever-conflicted Novalyne, who never knows whether to love Bob, admire him, abhor him, fear him, or hate him. It is telling indeed that this was Price Ellis' first and only book, written when she was a retired English teacher at the age of 76! Although she insisted that she never really loved Bob Howard, she usually did it with tears in her eyes, as witnesses will tell you.

    This movie is probably one of the best to come out of the nineties. I mean, the storyline is fresh, the characters are endearing and sympathetic, and the interactions between the two leads and you the viewer is just perfectly conducted. The title makes you suppose it is this vast tale about a physical journey, when in fact it is a journey of the heart and mind. And one that is a very dangerous undertaking. Renee Zellweger has the rare talent of formulating chemistry with any of her co-stars, but here with Vincent D'Onofrio it's so much more natural. You feel the sizzling sexual tension between the two from start to finish. The characters are a match for each other in every way and it just breaks your heart when the ending comes upon you. Vincent D'Onofrio was the perfect choice for Robert E. Howard, you could see, hear and feel his emotional conflicts and mental instability. He brought a kind of charming hopelessness to this person who needs to be taken care of by taking care of someone else. Zellweger was (as usual) wonderfully cute in this role. She falls for the wild, uncertain pulp fiction writer and has the means to help him, but tragically is unable to. The pacing of this movie was flawless. The movie just flies by and by the end you want to put it on again it was so delicious. This movie doesn't look like much on the outside, but beneath the cover and strangely misleading title is an illustrious tale of two beings destined for greatness and each other.

    This movie is a incredible insight to one of the greatest pulp writers ever. Almost everyone knows who Conan is, very few people know Robert Howard is the writer and even fewer know about his life. This movie is a very good character drama with a bit of a love story. Vincent Donofrio is a outstanding actor and did a brilliant job portraying the late great Robert Howard. Renee Zellweger had a excellent part playing Howards "love interest" Novalyne Price who was also his life long friend. It is incredible to see how fragile of a human Howard was even though he pen created powerful killers that had no remorse. The only disappointment I had was that there was little seen of the letters he wrote to Price which were at times poetic and tragic. A movie that will surprise you. Not recommended for children under 15.

    I was at Big Lots and they have movies for like 3 bucks there and I saw this movie. I absolutely love Vincent D'Onofrio, fell in love with him when I first watched Law & Order: Criminal Intent. And I idolize Renee Zellweger, she is one of the few beautiful women in Hollywood who can actually act. I picked this movie up and I couldn't believe that both these people where in it. I got so excited and bought it on the spot. I watched a few days later and it was nothing I expected. It was beautiful, amazing. I wasn't surprised that I had never heard of it before, because people can't except a movie this deep, they can't except and enjoy something so different and deep. Unlike a lot of movies I love, I didn't fall in love with this movie, I grew into love. I gradually began to appreciate its uniqueness more and more the longer it went on. The end was heart wrenching, Zellweger's and D'Onofrio's performances were top notch. It also holds the best on-screen kiss I have ever seen.

    Instead of watching another "so-so" movie, give this one a try. There's not a lot of action (no car chases, etc.), but it is an intelligent movie with good acting, good writing, and a story you probably never heard. I am not a Renee Zellweger fan but as this is one of her earlier films, she is watchable. She is very good as a small town teacher/writer wanna be. Vincent D'Onofrio is great in the lead. It is hard to believe he is a New Yorker as he becomes this troubled Texan. You will probably cry at least once while watching it. The DVD was actually cut, leaving out some "not essential(?)" portions that would have made the movie better.

    Set in 1930's small town Texas are two unlikely characters: one who is an accomplished writer and one who "wants to be". Their journey is a rare story these days (writing this in 2009) in writing or on the screen. Not since watching "84 Charring Cross Road" have I applauded such realism. Bob Howard, famed author of "Conan the Barbarian" is seen as he was in real life through the eyes of an unusually brave woman, Novalyne Price (the story taken directly from her book "One Who Walked Alone"). Howard (played by Vincent D'Onofrio) was a real loner who found himself in love; an impossible situation for any recluse, let alone a perhaps misunderstood misanthropic one. Price (played by Rene Zellweger), carries the other hard end of the bargain, a sociable yet independent single woman in 1930's Texas who's burden of loving him is even more unimaginable to bear, but not in any of the trite ways one might think. Most of us cower from those who do not "behave" as society dictates, or to be more blunt, as our loved ones dictate; Price does and doesn't, in a classy yet grounded blend of grace. Both characters are surprising and totally human. Shot in only 24 days, this "little" movie is a buy-to-own keeper. No wonder Zellweger went on to movie stardom after this role. To quote Rene, her performance is in part "Many thanks to Vincent". An amazing portrait of the best of both actor's range of talent. Recommended highly.

    I've been wanting to see this for some time and was glad I finally got a copy. I'm not a huge Robert E. Howard fan, but I do have some of his stories. I'm mainly interested in his correspondence with Lovecraft and Clark Ashton Smith. But, even if you have no idea who Howard was, this is still a good little film to check out. It takes place in Texas in the 1930's. A young schoolteacher and budding pulp writer Howard meet and then start dating, sort of. Other than the fact they both love writing, there isn't a whole lot in common between the two. But, they do have chemistry, and the movie has one of the best cinematic kisses I can recall. If you know anything about Howard, you know what will be in this movie. I don't want to ruin it for anyone, so I'll not discuss that. But, you do get a glimpse into the world of the man who created Conan(who has a new feature film sans Arnold in the near future) and Solomon Kane(who has a feature film on the cusp of release). Yes, Howard was unusual. Not crazy, but certainly sheltered and depressed, alone and living in his fantasy world. I can't recommend this enough for his fans, writers, etc. Hearing Howard discuss receiving a letter from HP Lovecraft almost made me have to change my drawers. I was so hoping Lovecraft would be in the film, even for 2 minutes, but you will be disappointed if you are looking for him. That is the only scene with anything about him and if you aren't paying attention, you'll miss it. I don't know how long it will take for Hollywood to get its act together to make a good Lovecraft biopic, God knows we need one and there is so much fertile ground in his life that it would trump even this film. Oddly enough, the film references Oliver Goldsmith's Vicar of Wakefield twice. I happen to be reading the book now, which I thought was an incredibly weird coincidence. I had to cover my ears so none of the plot would be given away, D'oh! Anyway, watch this movie.

    I think that this is a great love story that never happened. But I am not sure that it is about a great love between Novalynne and Bob Howard, in fact I think it is about a great love between Bob and his Mom that could never come to fruition due to their blood relationship. He was so tied to his Mom that he could never really be released from that relationship to form a real adult relationship with a woman his own age. I think it is very telling that he took the irrevocable step that he did upon her death. If you have read the "Conan the Barbarian books" then you can't help but be interested in the guy who thought up all that macho he-man stuff and wrote it in excellent true pulp fiction style. The truth about him is far more tragic and interesting than I would have thought before seeing this movie. I recommend it not only for the wonderful period detail (despite a few glitches) but because it is a real story about real flawed people.

    Often I have seen a great script thrown away by miscasting or poor direction. Not here! Spectacular acting, great story and direction. This is a drama that is brought to life in the realistic portrayals by Renee Zellweger and Vincent D'Onofrio. I have never really liked Renee much. Seen most of her films, including Jerry McGuire, Chicago, Cold Mountain, Bridget Jones, etc and and thought what is the big fuss about? However, I saw this film later after all her successes and was blown away by her performance. This in my opinion is by far her best work - she and D'Onofrio were so compelling in every scene that it leaves me wanting more each time I see it. I wish they would find another vehicle to work in together. Of course Vincent is is his normal "larger than life" performance. He always entirely captures my attention whenever he is on the screen in any film - but he made the person of Robert E. Howard come alive and even though I never knew much about this author, I wanted to read the book written by Novalyne Price after I saw the film the first time. Their physical difference in height was interesting contrast because you don't notice it after awhile because of both of their strong performances - they share equally and I loved the contrast in how physical the portrayal by Vincent was and how internal the portrayal by Renee. Since this is a drama, it's not a film that you tell all your friends to watch - they just won't understand. But you tell everyone who has a passion for film making to watch it and without exception they all love it and thank you for turning them on to it. If you tell someone to see this because it's a love story - they are going to be really depressed when it is over so I am careful when recommending it - its a tragic love story that is a true labor of love by the entire production team is a much better description. The director, producers and enter cast and crew gave this little gem so much love and attention, and it shows - I think that if this film was made now and Mirmax distributed it, or was debuted at the right festival it would be a film that would be recognized and given the much deserved awards and distribution it deserves.

    I have to admit up front, I originally sought this movie out because I'm a dedicated fan of the enigmatic pulp genius Robert E. Howard, who ended his prolific career by a self-inflicted gunshot to the head in 1936. This movie is based on the memoirs of a woman he was involved with named Novalyn Price. So again to be up front, this movie is very pleasing to me as a fan of Bob Howard. It reveals some of the negative aspects of this man (although skimming clear of his extreme racist views, which to be fair he tended to show more in his writing than in his personal behavior) but also shows us a lot of his heart and the beauty of his writer's soul that always found such tortured expression in the famous "Conan" and "Solomon Kane" stories. But I think the movie is going to be just as pleasing to those who are not fans of Howard's writing -- perhaps even more so, because this isn't really a movie just about a writer, it's about a relationship between two writers. And it's a messy, very realistic relationship at that. This was a very early film for Renee Zellweger, and I was impressed right away with the ability she shows here in this film. None of her subsequent and often acclaimed performances have matched what she did here, opposite the great character actor Vincent D'Onofrio who brings Howard himself to vivid life. The movie is all about these 2 people -- there are no action scenes, there is no real drama except a manufactured drama that Bob Howard creates to compensate for his inadequacy and lack of resolve. There are many powerful scenes where these 2 people are consumed in an atmosphere of natural beauty, which suggests the world of imagination inside these writers -- Novalyn says from the hillside "you can see the whole wide world from up here" and Howard says "other worlds, too." Always the sense of what Bob Howard's imaginary world could look like is bubbling beneath the surface of what we see -- never do the film-makers stoop to any actual visualization of the fantasy universe, but sound effects and music are effectively used to create that sense of his dangerous and exotic fantasy world, while at the same time there is an emptiness around Novalyn's literary aspirations which contrasts with it. There are always two stories battling here -- a love story between two human beings and a sort of journey in stasis between two writers. There's no way to put into precise words just how incredible I think D'Onofrio's performance is here. Again, as a longtime fan of Bob Howard, I can say that the performance matches my image of him down to the smallest physical mannerisms. As a treat for fans we even get to see Bob in his late phase when he wore a sombrero and liked to walk the streets of El Paso "disguised" as a Mexican. All of Bob's paranoia and his contradictions are on display, and even more fascinating when put into the light of day by dramatic action -- he was a man whose ego demanded absolute self-sufficiency, but who had such deep emotional ties to his small circle of family and friends that he was unable to cope with any kind of loss in his life. The manufactured drama when Bob finds out that Novalyn is dating his friend Truett is just one of the more harmless examples of this, but Novalyn's perspective as expressed in the film enables us to see how deeply Bob Howard's behavior must have hurt and alienated the very people he needed and trusted so deeply. The pain and confusion are brilliantly expressed in Zellweger's performance, and there are also a pair of excellent supporting performances from Ann Wedgeworth and Harve Presnell as the Howard parents. This is a beautiful film, this is a film that has a world of emotion while having absolutely no stylized or melodramatic plot devices to push us one way or the other in our feelings -- it just unfolds at the pace of its story and draws us in to the lives of 2 people in a particular place and time. They are people who don't seem to fit -- a big awkward hulk of a fantasy writer whose hard working Texan neighbors think he's a sissy, and a headstrong woman trying to make a career for herself in the same conservative universe. But through the eye of this cinematic gem, they both seem to belong in this time and place and we feel as if they left a bit of their hearts behind in their writings so that we could discover it with them.
