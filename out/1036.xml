    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

    Imaginary (but very real) character Fred causes havoc on Elizabeth's life. Phoebe Cates is beautiful, but her range of acting or emotion is rather limited which makes this movie one dimensional (sorry Phoebe). The movie gets tiresome pretty quickly, because of this. I guess the role of Fred is to cause catharsis to Liz, but the story is really awkwardly told. I suppose many of the things that happens is supposed to be funny, but it really isn't. The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

    Imaginary (but very real) character Fred causes havoc on Elizabeth's life. Phoebe Cates is beautiful, but her range of acting or emotion is rather limited which makes this movie one dimensional (sorry Phoebe). The movie gets tiresome pretty quickly, because of this. I guess the role of Fred is to cause catharsis to Liz, but the story is really awkwardly told. I suppose many of the things that happens is supposed to be funny, but it really isn't. The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

    Imaginary (but very real) character Fred causes havoc on Elizabeth's life. Phoebe Cates is beautiful, but her range of acting or emotion is rather limited which makes this movie one dimensional (sorry Phoebe). The movie gets tiresome pretty quickly, because of this. I guess the role of Fred is to cause catharsis to Liz, but the story is really awkwardly told. I suppose many of the things that happens is supposed to be funny, but it really isn't. The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

    Imaginary (but very real) character Fred causes havoc on Elizabeth's life. Phoebe Cates is beautiful, but her range of acting or emotion is rather limited which makes this movie one dimensional (sorry Phoebe). The movie gets tiresome pretty quickly, because of this. I guess the role of Fred is to cause catharsis to Liz, but the story is really awkwardly told. I suppose many of the things that happens is supposed to be funny, but it really isn't. The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

    Drop Dead Fred (1991) Watching Drop Dead Fred as an adult is 100% different from watching Drop Dead Fred as a kid. Yes, I know that certain movies are like that - you'll pick up on jokes that you didn't get when you were eight years old...however, most don't give you an entirely different experience. If you haven't seen Drop Dead Fred, the basic synopsis is about a girl who goes to live with her (terrible) mother after she loses her car, her husband, and her job. As a kid, I remember cracking up at Fred's antics, flinging boogers at people and looking up the skirts of unsuspecting women. As an adult, this movie really ventures into dark territory. It's about a girl, verbally (and possibly physically) abused by her mother - so much so that her father ends up leaving. Finally an adult, she escapes the throngs of her household only to find herself completely co-dependent on men, and ends up in another abusive relationship - this time with an abusive husband. All the while, she conjures up an imaginary friend named Fred (who has a British accent, much like her father). Watching this as an adult, this movie has some heavy things going for it. Lizzy, the main character, definitely has issues upon issues. It's actually fun to see her transformation from co-dependent to independent. Fred's humor doesn't exactly do it for me anymore, but the scenes in which he's simply making Lizzy's body move are still hilarious (a standout scene in an Italian restaurant comes to mind). The acting is fairly pedestrian, the only real standout being Phoebe Cates as Lizzy. Since this, the director went back overseas and hasn't done any movies that I've heard of since then. Kids movies were definitely different back then. Watching this now, I can honestly say that I don't think this is a good movie for kids, but if you saw it when you were younger, it's definitely worth another exploration now. Final Score: 3/5

    I did enjoy the crude humor throughout, but see two big problems with this movie. First, the two leads misfire. Of course Phoebe Cates must be frumpy and repressed so she can blossom later, but this means hiding Phoebe's best qualities as an actress for most of the movie. That is a big mistake. Why do producers insist on turning pretty girls into unattractive miserable ones? As for Rik Mayall, the Brits can keep him, and they have. So the two leads are neutered or irritating, right up until Phoebe's booger attack, which is the climax,and best scene in the entire movie. She should have attacked her mom too, just for kicks. Unfortunately we see very little blossoming thereafter, and the movie ends with a thud. Second, and more importantly, the idiotic underlying message of this movie is that destructive behavior leads to emotional growth and a happy ending. In other words, give in to your irrational urges and endanger others and damage their property. It will make you a better person! For example, was it REALLY necessary for Phoebe to wreck her friend's houseboat just so she could learn how to talk back to her mother? NO. Only people who can't understand normal thinking would write or believe this. Yet many only see the movie's superficial personal growth aspect. True, Phoebe's mom and husband are unpleasant, and she did need to assert herself, or else ditch them. But frankly, the writers and Phoebe's character need to put their tinfoil hats back on. If there is a remake, don't forget the boogers.

    At the age of 5 "Elizabeth 'Lizzie' Cronin" (Phoebe Cates) was sad and lonely. So she developed an imaginary friend she called, "Drop Dead Fred" (Rik Mayall). But time passes and she eventually forgets about him. Until she loses her husband "Charles" (Tim Matheson), her job and her car all on the same day. She then becomes sad and lonely. And Drop Dead Fred reappears. Now, normally a friend who returns after so many years wouldn't be such a bad thing. But this isn't any "normal" friend. Instead he's an obnoxious and destructive influence who was always getting her into trouble. And while she may have grown up, he has not. Anyway, as far as this movie is concerned, I thought it got off to a rather rough start but things began to get really funny immediately after the "houseboat scene" when "Janie" (Carrie Fisher) tries to take matters into her own hands. Likewise, the restaurant scene was quite funny as well. Having said that though, there were other scenes which weren't nearly as good and this caused the movie to seem uneven. I thought Marsha Mason (as "Polly Cronin") looked great. But as far as the acting was concerned, other than Phoebe Cates and Carrie Fisher, I didn't really care for anybody else in the cast. And as far as that goes, Rik Mayall made me cringe every time he appeared as he was just too over-the-top. Even so, this wasn't a bad movie necessarily and it did have some good moments as I have already mentioned. That said, I have no doubts that some will really enjoy it. But to me it was only average.

    Drop Dead Fred is a horrible experience full of immature material. Only a very small amount of slapstick humour (which I didn't find amusing while others kind of did), but that's not enough to keeping the whole movie occupied. It was so incoherent that it provided me with the most unpleasant and embarrassing experience I've ever had watching a film. The plot is unimaginable and incomprehensible. Fred is a complete idiot who ruins and humiliates Elizabeth (Phoebe Cates, Gremlins I & II), the main character's life. I mean if you're seeing an imaginary friend you either can't see it or its hallucination. He makes her throw a bin of yellow slimy stuff at her Nan. I would hardly recommend any viewers under 5 to watch this. It could teach them bad manners. If you're watching this pile of puke right now I'd warn you to turn it off, get away from toddlers banging pans together and smashing dishes, go into the bathroom, look into the mirror (cover your face with water), clear your mind and think about something completely imaginable (I know it sounds strange but it's just a warning from me). Now this is a film where the actors/actresses go way over their heads. Once DD Fred causes embarrassment, all the others main actors on the set go bonkers. At one point Liz has coffee with a chap named Mickey Bunce, a date kind of thing, which Fred wrecks as always, causing Bunce to go nuts. I couldn't get my head round it. Martha Mason plays the mother of Liz, Polly Cronin. She's completely unhinged over Fred. It's like she wants to abandon her child on the street. She traps him in a wooden box and wraps it in cello tape, causing young Liz to end up in tears. There's another thing I don't get: Why would Liz let loose a mental maniac from the box years later when she's wants to get on with her unstable life (to try and make it better) and it's going to make her life more unstable? If I was her I would just leave him there to suffer and then throw the box into a dump compactor(probably what I should do with the DVD). Now as Drop Dead Fred provides nothing to recommend, I'm starting to think why it was made this way. It could have been a kid's movie. What I mostly think of this is why it was even made. I can't believe it's not on IMDb's Bottom 100 list and why anyone would even like this. It's one of these unusual Hollywood movies where parents, with their children, would end up going to the nearest exit outside the cinema or a DVD showing, which I attended. Any parent would be appalled with the entirely childish and occasionally inappropriate content. I spent most of my experience trying to figure out a way to get out of the place. Misguided, misconcieved and completely mental and stupid, you won't survive the running time. It wastes your time. Avoid.

    Lizzie Cronin is having a terrible day, her husband Charles leaves her, her car gets stolen then she gets fired to make matters worse her overbearing mother insists that she comes to stay with her. That night something strange happens; the jack-in-the-box in her room starts to play by itself; then when it opens out pops Drop Dead Fred; the imaginary friend that she had as a child and hasn't seen since she was young. Drop Dead Fred isn't the gentle sort of friend who might play dolls with her; he'd rip their heads off and make mud pies. He hasn't calmed down over the years and promptly starts to cause trouble for Lizzie. She might know that what is going on is Fred's doing but as nobody else can see him she gets the blame and quite understandably her sanity is called into question. Lizzie just wants Fred to go away and to get back together with Charles but it is clear that he doesn't deserve her; it will take her some time before she realises though. While adult Lizzie is trying to get Charles back we see flashbacks of young Lizzie's time with him as he causes yet more trouble. It must be admitted; this film is fairly immature but who cares? It has an anarchic charm that should bring out the child in the viewer. Phoebe Cates does a fine job as Lizzie but it is Rik Mayall's performance as Drop Dead Fred that is most memorable; not surprising given that his character is the cause of so much mayhem. Ashley Peldon was great fun as the young Lizzie; she had just the right look of innocence and naughtiness. The story is fairly straightforward but it is enjoyable and has more than enough laughs to make it well worth watching. It isn't perfect of course; some of the effects are a little bit dated and Charles was so obviously sleazy that it was a little hard that she'd even consider taking him back let alone actively trying to get him back. There is some language that some parents might not want younger viewers hearing as well as some mildly sexual moments although these are comical rather than erotic. Over all I'd say this is well worth watching if it is on television or even getting on DVD if you see it in the bargain bin.

    Imaginary (but very real) character Fred causes havoc on Elizabeth's life. Phoebe Cates is beautiful, but her range of acting or emotion is rather limited which makes this movie one dimensional (sorry Phoebe). The movie gets tiresome pretty quickly, because of this. I guess the role of Fred is to cause catharsis to Liz, but the story is really awkwardly told. I suppose many of the things that happens is supposed to be funny, but it really isn't. The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.

    The always appealing Phoebe Cates plays the central character in this classic horror movie about a dangerously psychotic woman who is tormented by the emergence of her sociopathic other personality, a criminally deranged and manipulative version of Johnny Rotten. Out of control, she destroys her relationships, her family life, and her friend's boat, until eventually, betrayed by her overbearing mother and her philandering husband, she retreats into the only safe place left, the dark and lonely recesses of her own mind, where she must confront ghastly visions of her loved ones and the terrified child she once was. Finally, even her hallucinatory tormentor abandons her, and she regains her sanity at cost of turning her back on everyone and everything she has ever held dear. She begins a new life with the only man who has ever been oblivious enough to stand by her... oblivious enough not to notice even as the first signs emerge that her psychosis has begun to infect his only child... A seminal film, this dark masterpiece was clearly the inspiration for later phantasmagoric horror excursions like "The Mask", in which Jim Carrey plays a man who undergoes a hideous mutation, and "Amelie", a similar tale of a young woman dangerously disassociated from reality.

    I first watched this film when I was a child, and hadn't seen it in years. It had always made me cry. And still does. I admit at the age of 26 I still love this film. I hate Elizabeth's mother, she is controlling. I was happy when I saw this on DVD in a store near me, and although it was cheap I wondered if I should get it. No regrets, now I can watch it over and over. And cry at the end. I have just finished watching it and some tears were streaming. You have to watch it till the end to understand. I have watched Rik Mayall in Bottom-a British comedy. I didn't know he had broken out in America, well I was young. I love his look in the film, and thought he and Elizabeth were good for each other (I know he wasn't real). My niece who aged 5 likes this film, although she hasn't watched it all, I will gladly show her. I know she will enjoy it.

    So, here is a movie that has been hated by a lot of people and a few people really like this movie. I personally don't like it but I thought the premise was an interesting one and they did actually get a few things right with this movie. The plot is that a woman named Elizabeth has just been divorced by her husband Charles. After saying he wants to be with Annabella, Elizabeth loses both her car and job. Then after being forced to go to her mother's house (and Elizabeth's childhood home) and she opens an old Jack-in-a-box that contained her imaginary friend from childhood. Together they find ways to make her happy but Fred causes a lot of trouble as well. So what are my complaints? Firstly, it takes Elizabeth an hour's worth of movie time to get her some psychological help. She even tells people she's crazy and about her imaginary friend and they do nothing but either believe her or react unrealistically. I'm not kidding, people actually believe Elizabeth when talking about her IMAGINARY FRIEND. Then there's the Fred character himself, I can see exactly what they were trying to do with the character, (basically a child in a man's body) but it doesn't really work mainly because of his antics. They're either weird for a young kid's fantasy or too over the top. With all that being said I did like how Mayall was able to take that role and make it his own. But now onto what I thought they did right. I personally enjoyed when Fred did phase out of these antics and actually deliver some good advice to Elizabeth in a flashback saying "be who you want to be, not what your mother wants you to be." I also enjoyed the ending, no I am not one of those critics. I personally think it had a good ending. Where Fred and Elizabeth go into her mind and make her stand up for everything that is or has been holding her back (as well as un-restraining a younger version of herself) and Fred leaves saying he can't be with her anymore because she would be perfectly happy in the real world. Then once she does enter the real world she leaves Charles and tells her mother that she is a grown woman and that she is going o live her life. I personally think that's one thing they did get right. So aside from that I am in full favour of a remake. Just not who they decided to cast as Fred (Russel Brand). I personally think that it has a good premise, just in need of a better execution.

The script writer isn't good at comedic delivery. Cate's dead pan acting makes things worse in this case. So, the movie really doesn't deliver what it should have delivered - funny situation with insight about person's development, and a sidekick who helps named Fred. Not enough talent gathered for this movie for it to work. But experimental movies are okay with me. Producers and actors should have thought more about how to make the situation work. But as it is, it's not a good job at any level.

    Weird, but surprisingly good.

    I've watched this movie about twice when I was a kid, and only when it popped up on TV. And when it was on, I was mesmerized. And now that I saw it recently,I am telling every one about it! Though there is SOME foul language, I really would show this to my own kids, because it's so funny. About a grown up woman who's imaginary friend comes back to hang out with her till she's happy, this movie is moving and makes you remember your own imaginary friend. The ending has a good morale and lesson, and the plot, though weird (what isn't weird these days) is well done. Without hesitation, I would definitely show this to any one who would listen.
