    A lethargic thriller that wants to say something about the Chinese justice system and Western violence, but is really just an excuse for Richard Gere to squint a lot. He's a lawyer who wakes up after bedding a gorgeous model to find her dead on the floor of his hotel room. With the help of his wooden lawyer Bai Ling he tries to convince the Chinese authorities of his innocence and uncovers a plot to frame him. Fresh ideas are not this sorry film's strong point as it prefers to churn up clich&eacute;s left, right and centre, as well as starting with what seems like the first twenty minutes of the film missing, which means it's off to a running start and I didn't give a crap what happens to Gere or anyone else. Occasionally it threatens to get gripping, but instead cops out and bores us some more, lumbering on to the who-cares courtroom revelation.

    This is a really boring and probably unrealistic movie. I don't believe the Chinese authorities would treat a foreign man accused of murder like they do i in this film. They would not refuse him to speak to an official from the US Embassy and they would not refuse him a lawyer from his own country. This is just a typical prejudicial way to represent China in American movies. That having been said I've never seen a movie before with such a promising premise, being made so utterly boring. Geres character is not very likable from the start so as an audience we really don't care what happens to him. We don't get to know him at all before he is arrested and he is acting completely irrational several times during the trial. The worst moment in his movie is when he, after having successfully escaped and gotten to the US embassy, out of some misguided stupid loyalty to his Chinese lawyer,gives himself up again to the Chinese authority, knowing they will shoot him even though he is innocent. At that point I was thinking: this guy is a moron with a death wish, just shoot him already so the movie can end. And during his escape he can outrun and out-bike-ride armed men, some of the on motorcycles. Give me a break. Don't waste time on this crap unless you have trouble sleeping. In that case this movie is the perfect sleeping pill. The

    I have watched this movie many times! When i first watched it, i remember it generating a very sinister atmosphere! There was no flaws in the action, acting, the cinematography, the score or the plot. On another note, I agree it is easy to see it as a negative portrayal of the Chinese, but perhaps not. As many have said, it may actually be quite realistic to what would happen if a foreigner was accused of murdering a native, but not just for China, any country really. I think they make that clear by pointing out quite a few times in the dialogue, that China has a much larger population than America, but a much much lower crime rate. It was made obvious that this was meant to be an isolated incident and not a generalist view of all of China. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

    Jack Moore, a high-profile international lawyer, is in China for business. Moore sleeps with a young woman, and wakes up to find her dead in his bed. Falsely accused of murder, Moore's only chance is his Chinese advocate Yuelin. The rules and laws are different, and Moore must convince Yuelin of his innocence and unravel the chain of events that entrapped him... One cannot deny that Gere is very good in this movie, it's one of his best roles without Julia Roberts being involved, but the whole thing is a little overlong, and very boring. It's not Geres fault, it's the script and the narrative just plods on and focuses too much on him alone and complaining that his earphone/telephone isn't working. But it wouldn't hurt to just have a couple of exciting scenes? The one scenes with him running toward the embassy is a little too late, another case of a deceptive trailer. so all in all, Gere is good, film isn't, and it all has a 'Rising Sun' feel to it

    Recently watched this movie on Netflix, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie and deserves to be rated higher on IMDb. I've watched many movies that are rated in the 6-7 range, and this one does not belong in that category! I am not a Richard Gere fan - as a matter of fact I even rooted for Bruce Willis in the Jackal... but I was definitely impressed with Richard Gere in this one... He is probably far outside his comfort zone in this role, and has done an excellent job. But the real star of the show is Ling Bhai. She has delivered an outstanding performance. I gather that only a few shots were actually shot in China, but you don't get that feeling while watching the film - you feel like the film was actually shot in China... I am not sure of the accuracy of the portrayal of the judicial process in China, but was it was refreshing to see something other than what we are all so used to with Law and Order. Overall, I recommend this movie. While it is not in the same league as "Primal Fear", it is definitely worth a watch... and it will keep you engaged for the entire film.

    You know, many people have been bashing on "Red Corner" saying it's not the real China at all. Whether it's or not, doesn't matter; it's a movie, the spectator has to know the difference between a movie and reality. If you really wanna know how it's like in China, search for it on Internet or ask some of your teachers... watching a movie isn't necessarily showing the truth. For instance, there's been made a film called "Turistas" that shows Brazilian people killing and robbing, and nobody is naive enough to believe that's the real Brazil. The same for "Hostel". "Red Corner" is an entertaining political/juridical film towards an American guy suffering a conspiracy from the Chinese authorities and finds a Chinese attorney who helps him. If you like Law and Sociology you'll probably enjoy it and appreciate the ending. The cast do their best and if you have a strong sense of justice, it will be very tense for you. It's just a shame that nobody has seen this film, I believe it didn't have enough publicity back when released.

    I picked this movie late one night as I was having trouble falling asleep and because of the mostly negative reviews I had read about it, thought it would soon put me to sleep. I am a fan of neither Richard Gere nor Bai Ling but found myself soon being drawn into the unfolding drama and getting more alert and interested, instead of drowsy, as the movie progressed. Both leads turned in solidly strong and very believable performances (Bai Ling really surprised me) and I really loved the handling of the developing relationship between their characters. Instead of taking a turn into romance or eroticism(an easy and tempting directorial path) the focus instead was on how they come to understand and truly appreciate each other for what each is, and isn't, to the point that both don't hesitate to take great risks for the other's sake. The depiction of mainland Chinese bureaucracy and corruption (at the time) is by all accounts, accurate. I found the courtroom drama tense and riveting. The ending is poignant and fitting, though in the end you can't help but wish they stay together. An under-appreciated movie. See it if you get the chance; you could do far, far worse.

    Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is an American TV executive in Beijing trying to put together a deal for supplying material to China. He catches the eye of a Chinese girl and they head off to his hotel room: the next morning he wakes to find himself covered in her blood and taken away by the authorities to face trial for her murder. He discovers that the Chinese justice system works on very different lines to the US system. With the help of a female Chinese advocate he begins to try to make sense of what has happened to him. This film is mostly a cross between a paranoia thriller and a courtroom drama, with some action sequences which don't fit that comfortably, and some interesting overtones about how to find justice in a system which encourages confession to obtain leniency, and a woman's place in a system which is, in some respects, strongly feudal. There is an irritating moment about halfway through where the plot is moved along by an accidental, fortuitous, and completely improbable discovery by Gere (he catches a bit of a TV broadcast filling in a convenient gap in his knowledge). Gere is good as a man whose self-confidence and arrogance is gradually worn away by the reality of a system which simply won't permit them to exist. Bai Ling is better as his Chinese advocate - realistic, dignified, recognising the need to work within the system as it as, and a woman of intelligence in a culture which does not value her qualities in the way they would be valued in the West. The Beijing setting is unusual, atmospheric and convincing. The film is gripping throughout and a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movie.

    Overall, this isn't a bad movie. It's a pretty decent courtroom drama - sort of "Law & Order Beijing." It's got a lot of suspense, and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso, of course, that the star of this movie is Richard Gere, and Gere is known for having a somewhat anti-Chinese (or, more accurately, anti-People's Republic of China) outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one - and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law (thank goodness!) but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you, you know that the basic message (even though you don't speak Chinese) is "get out of the way or we'll trample you!" So, yes, even in completely unthreatening circumstances, there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China. In this movie, Gere plays Jack Moore, an American businessman trying to close a deal in China, who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room, he's the prime suspect and it's clear that "the system" has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously pre-arranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue. All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the "one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China" scenario. Yes, Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer (played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai) who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence, but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom, he essentially takes over the case, questioning witnesses - even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much, and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still, it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.

    This is one of those average films one does not expect to have much substance. Unexpectedly though, director Jon Avnet and a script by Robert King provide the basis for a surprising hit. The essence of this film is called " Red Corner " and tells the story of an American businessman and attorney Jack Moore (Richard Gere) who visits China to broker a satellite communication's deal with up and coming Chinese businessmen. However, Mr. Moore has the unfortunate luck to make enemies out of unscrupulous executives.They set him up with a sexy Chinese girl who returns to his hotel room, where both strip, make love, get drunk and pass out. The following morning, Jack is accosted, arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of the girl. Unaware of Chinese criminal procedures, the accused has little to expect, except that execution is swift if he confesses. Pleading Not Guilty is not an option and is fully explained by his court appointed attorney Shen Yuelin (Ling Bai). Together they face an up hill battle to prevent his execution and prove his innocence. Versitle actor (West Wing) Bradley Whitford) plays a U.S. consulate friend. The movie itself is filled with dark drama, exciting realism, scary prison scenes and brutality. Gere is incredible as he portrays a man on the brink of death trying to exonerate himself from a twisted government where friend and foe alike wear the same color hat. Terrific movie. ****

Together they face an up hill battle to prevent his execution and prove his innocence. Versitle actor (West Wing) Bradley Whitford) plays a U.S. consulate friend. The movie itself is filled with dark drama, exciting realism, scary prison scenes and brutality. Gere is incredible as he portrays a man on the brink of death trying to exonerate himself from a twisted government where friend and foe alike wear the same color hat. Terrific movie. ****

    A lethargic thriller that wants to say something about the Chinese justice system and Western violence, but is really just an excuse for Richard Gere to squint a lot. He's a lawyer who wakes up after bedding a gorgeous model to find her dead on the floor of his hotel room. With the help of his wooden lawyer Bai Ling he tries to convince the Chinese authorities of his innocence and uncovers a plot to frame him. Fresh ideas are not this sorry film's strong point as it prefers to churn up clich&eacute;s left, right and centre, as well as starting with what seems like the first twenty minutes of the film missing, which means it's off to a running start and I didn't give a crap what happens to Gere or anyone else. Occasionally it threatens to get gripping, but instead cops out and bores us some more, lumbering on to the who-cares courtroom revelation.

    This is a really boring and probably unrealistic movie. I don't believe the Chinese authorities would treat a foreign man accused of murder like they do i in this film. They would not refuse him to speak to an official from the US Embassy and they would not refuse him a lawyer from his own country. This is just a typical prejudicial way to represent China in American movies. That having been said I've never seen a movie before with such a promising premise, being made so utterly boring. Geres character is not very likable from the start so as an audience we really don't care what happens to him. We don't get to know him at all before he is arrested and he is acting completely irrational several times during the trial. The worst moment in his movie is when he, after having successfully escaped and gotten to the US embassy, out of some misguided stupid loyalty to his Chinese lawyer,gives himself up again to the Chinese authority, knowing they will shoot him even though he is innocent. At that point I was thinking: this guy is a moron with a death wish, just shoot him already so the movie can end. And during his escape he can outrun and out-bike-ride armed men, some of the on motorcycles. Give me a break. Don't waste time on this crap unless you have trouble sleeping. In that case this movie is the perfect sleeping pill. The

    I have watched this movie many times! When i first watched it, i remember it generating a very sinister atmosphere! There was no flaws in the action, acting, the cinematography, the score or the plot. On another note, I agree it is easy to see it as a negative portrayal of the Chinese, but perhaps not. As many have said, it may actually be quite realistic to what would happen if a foreigner was accused of murdering a native, but not just for China, any country really. I think they make that clear by pointing out quite a few times in the dialogue, that China has a much larger population than America, but a much much lower crime rate. It was made obvious that this was meant to be an isolated incident and not a generalist view of all of China. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

    Jack Moore, a high-profile international lawyer, is in China for business. Moore sleeps with a young woman, and wakes up to find her dead in his bed. Falsely accused of murder, Moore's only chance is his Chinese advocate Yuelin. The rules and laws are different, and Moore must convince Yuelin of his innocence and unravel the chain of events that entrapped him... One cannot deny that Gere is very good in this movie, it's one of his best roles without Julia Roberts being involved, but the whole thing is a little overlong, and very boring. It's not Geres fault, it's the script and the narrative just plods on and focuses too much on him alone and complaining that his earphone/telephone isn't working. But it wouldn't hurt to just have a couple of exciting scenes? The one scenes with him running toward the embassy is a little too late, another case of a deceptive trailer. so all in all, Gere is good, film isn't, and it all has a 'Rising Sun' feel to it

    Recently watched this movie on Netflix, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie and deserves to be rated higher on IMDb. I've watched many movies that are rated in the 6-7 range, and this one does not belong in that category! I am not a Richard Gere fan - as a matter of fact I even rooted for Bruce Willis in the Jackal... but I was definitely impressed with Richard Gere in this one... He is probably far outside his comfort zone in this role, and has done an excellent job. But the real star of the show is Ling Bhai. She has delivered an outstanding performance. I gather that only a few shots were actually shot in China, but you don't get that feeling while watching the film - you feel like the film was actually shot in China... I am not sure of the accuracy of the portrayal of the judicial process in China, but was it was refreshing to see something other than what we are all so used to with Law and Order. Overall, I recommend this movie. While it is not in the same league as "Primal Fear", it is definitely worth a watch... and it will keep you engaged for the entire film.

    You know, many people have been bashing on "Red Corner" saying it's not the real China at all. Whether it's or not, doesn't matter; it's a movie, the spectator has to know the difference between a movie and reality. If you really wanna know how it's like in China, search for it on Internet or ask some of your teachers... watching a movie isn't necessarily showing the truth. For instance, there's been made a film called "Turistas" that shows Brazilian people killing and robbing, and nobody is naive enough to believe that's the real Brazil. The same for "Hostel". "Red Corner" is an entertaining political/juridical film towards an American guy suffering a conspiracy from the Chinese authorities and finds a Chinese attorney who helps him. If you like Law and Sociology you'll probably enjoy it and appreciate the ending. The cast do their best and if you have a strong sense of justice, it will be very tense for you. It's just a shame that nobody has seen this film, I believe it didn't have enough publicity back when released.

    I picked this movie late one night as I was having trouble falling asleep and because of the mostly negative reviews I had read about it, thought it would soon put me to sleep. I am a fan of neither Richard Gere nor Bai Ling but found myself soon being drawn into the unfolding drama and getting more alert and interested, instead of drowsy, as the movie progressed. Both leads turned in solidly strong and very believable performances (Bai Ling really surprised me) and I really loved the handling of the developing relationship between their characters. Instead of taking a turn into romance or eroticism(an easy and tempting directorial path) the focus instead was on how they come to understand and truly appreciate each other for what each is, and isn't, to the point that both don't hesitate to take great risks for the other's sake. The depiction of mainland Chinese bureaucracy and corruption (at the time) is by all accounts, accurate. I found the courtroom drama tense and riveting. The ending is poignant and fitting, though in the end you can't help but wish they stay together. An under-appreciated movie. See it if you get the chance; you could do far, far worse.

    Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is an American TV executive in Beijing trying to put together a deal for supplying material to China. He catches the eye of a Chinese girl and they head off to his hotel room: the next morning he wakes to find himself covered in her blood and taken away by the authorities to face trial for her murder. He discovers that the Chinese justice system works on very different lines to the US system. With the help of a female Chinese advocate he begins to try to make sense of what has happened to him. This film is mostly a cross between a paranoia thriller and a courtroom drama, with some action sequences which don't fit that comfortably, and some interesting overtones about how to find justice in a system which encourages confession to obtain leniency, and a woman's place in a system which is, in some respects, strongly feudal. There is an irritating moment about halfway through where the plot is moved along by an accidental, fortuitous, and completely improbable discovery by Gere (he catches a bit of a TV broadcast filling in a convenient gap in his knowledge). Gere is good as a man whose self-confidence and arrogance is gradually worn away by the reality of a system which simply won't permit them to exist. Bai Ling is better as his Chinese advocate - realistic, dignified, recognising the need to work within the system as it as, and a woman of intelligence in a culture which does not value her qualities in the way they would be valued in the West. The Beijing setting is unusual, atmospheric and convincing. The film is gripping throughout and a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movie.

    Overall, this isn't a bad movie. It's a pretty decent courtroom drama - sort of "Law & Order Beijing." It's got a lot of suspense, and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso, of course, that the star of this movie is Richard Gere, and Gere is known for having a somewhat anti-Chinese (or, more accurately, anti-People's Republic of China) outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one - and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law (thank goodness!) but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you, you know that the basic message (even though you don't speak Chinese) is "get out of the way or we'll trample you!" So, yes, even in completely unthreatening circumstances, there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China. In this movie, Gere plays Jack Moore, an American businessman trying to close a deal in China, who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room, he's the prime suspect and it's clear that "the system" has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously pre-arranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue. All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the "one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China" scenario. Yes, Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer (played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai) who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence, but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom, he essentially takes over the case, questioning witnesses - even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much, and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still, it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.

    This is one of those average films one does not expect to have much substance. Unexpectedly though, director Jon Avnet and a script by Robert King provide the basis for a surprising hit. The essence of this film is called " Red Corner " and tells the story of an American businessman and attorney Jack Moore (Richard Gere) who visits China to broker a satellite communication's deal with up and coming Chinese businessmen. However, Mr. Moore has the unfortunate luck to make enemies out of unscrupulous executives.They set him up with a sexy Chinese girl who returns to his hotel room, where both strip, make love, get drunk and pass out. The following morning, Jack is accosted, arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of the girl. Unaware of Chinese criminal procedures, the accused has little to expect, except that execution is swift if he confesses. Pleading Not Guilty is not an option and is fully explained by his court appointed attorney Shen Yuelin (Ling Bai).

    This is a really boring and probably unrealistic movie. I don't believe the Chinese authorities would treat a foreign man accused of murder like they do i in this film. They would not refuse him to speak to an official from the US Embassy and they would not refuse him a lawyer from his own country. This is just a typical prejudicial way to represent China in American movies. That having been said I've never seen a movie before with such a promising premise, being made so utterly boring. Geres character is not very likable from the start so as an audience we really don't care what happens to him. We don't get to know him at all before he is arrested and he is acting completely irrational several times during the trial. The worst moment in his movie is when he, after having successfully escaped and gotten to the US embassy, out of some misguided stupid loyalty to his Chinese lawyer,gives himself up again to the Chinese authority, knowing they will shoot him even though he is innocent. At that point I was thinking: this guy is a moron with a death wish, just shoot him already so the movie can end. And during his escape he can outrun and out-bike-ride armed men, some of the on motorcycles. Give me a break. Don't waste time on this crap unless you have trouble sleeping. In that case this movie is the perfect sleeping pill. The

    I have watched this movie many times! When i first watched it, i remember it generating a very sinister atmosphere! There was no flaws in the action, acting, the cinematography, the score or the plot. On another note, I agree it is easy to see it as a negative portrayal of the Chinese, but perhaps not. As many have said, it may actually be quite realistic to what would happen if a foreigner was accused of murdering a native, but not just for China, any country really. I think they make that clear by pointing out quite a few times in the dialogue, that China has a much larger population than America, but a much much lower crime rate. It was made obvious that this was meant to be an isolated incident and not a generalist view of all of China. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

    Jack Moore, a high-profile international lawyer, is in China for business. Moore sleeps with a young woman, and wakes up to find her dead in his bed. Falsely accused of murder, Moore's only chance is his Chinese advocate Yuelin. The rules and laws are different, and Moore must convince Yuelin of his innocence and unravel the chain of events that entrapped him... One cannot deny that Gere is very good in this movie, it's one of his best roles without Julia Roberts being involved, but the whole thing is a little overlong, and very boring. It's not Geres fault, it's the script and the narrative just plods on and focuses too much on him alone and complaining that his earphone/telephone isn't working. But it wouldn't hurt to just have a couple of exciting scenes? The one scenes with him running toward the embassy is a little too late, another case of a deceptive trailer. so all in all, Gere is good, film isn't, and it all has a 'Rising Sun' feel to it

    Recently watched this movie on Netflix, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie and deserves to be rated higher on IMDb. I've watched many movies that are rated in the 6-7 range, and this one does not belong in that category! I am not a Richard Gere fan - as a matter of fact I even rooted for Bruce Willis in the Jackal... but I was definitely impressed with Richard Gere in this one... He is probably far outside his comfort zone in this role, and has done an excellent job. But the real star of the show is Ling Bhai. She has delivered an outstanding performance. I gather that only a few shots were actually shot in China, but you don't get that feeling while watching the film - you feel like the film was actually shot in China... I am not sure of the accuracy of the portrayal of the judicial process in China, but was it was refreshing to see something other than what we are all so used to with Law and Order. Overall, I recommend this movie. While it is not in the same league as "Primal Fear", it is definitely worth a watch... and it will keep you engaged for the entire film.

    You know, many people have been bashing on "Red Corner" saying it's not the real China at all. Whether it's or not, doesn't matter; it's a movie, the spectator has to know the difference between a movie and reality. If you really wanna know how it's like in China, search for it on Internet or ask some of your teachers... watching a movie isn't necessarily showing the truth. For instance, there's been made a film called "Turistas" that shows Brazilian people killing and robbing, and nobody is naive enough to believe that's the real Brazil. The same for "Hostel". "Red Corner" is an entertaining political/juridical film towards an American guy suffering a conspiracy from the Chinese authorities and finds a Chinese attorney who helps him. If you like Law and Sociology you'll probably enjoy it and appreciate the ending. The cast do their best and if you have a strong sense of justice, it will be very tense for you. It's just a shame that nobody has seen this film, I believe it didn't have enough publicity back when released.

    I picked this movie late one night as I was having trouble falling asleep and because of the mostly negative reviews I had read about it, thought it would soon put me to sleep. I am a fan of neither Richard Gere nor Bai Ling but found myself soon being drawn into the unfolding drama and getting more alert and interested, instead of drowsy, as the movie progressed. Both leads turned in solidly strong and very believable performances (Bai Ling really surprised me) and I really loved the handling of the developing relationship between their characters. Instead of taking a turn into romance or eroticism(an easy and tempting directorial path) the focus instead was on how they come to understand and truly appreciate each other for what each is, and isn't, to the point that both don't hesitate to take great risks for the other's sake. The depiction of mainland Chinese bureaucracy and corruption (at the time) is by all accounts, accurate. I found the courtroom drama tense and riveting. The ending is poignant and fitting, though in the end you can't help but wish they stay together. An under-appreciated movie. See it if you get the chance; you could do far, far worse.

    Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is an American TV executive in Beijing trying to put together a deal for supplying material to China. He catches the eye of a Chinese girl and they head off to his hotel room: the next morning he wakes to find himself covered in her blood and taken away by the authorities to face trial for her murder. He discovers that the Chinese justice system works on very different lines to the US system. With the help of a female Chinese advocate he begins to try to make sense of what has happened to him. This film is mostly a cross between a paranoia thriller and a courtroom drama, with some action sequences which don't fit that comfortably, and some interesting overtones about how to find justice in a system which encourages confession to obtain leniency, and a woman's place in a system which is, in some respects, strongly feudal. There is an irritating moment about halfway through where the plot is moved along by an accidental, fortuitous, and completely improbable discovery by Gere (he catches a bit of a TV broadcast filling in a convenient gap in his knowledge). Gere is good as a man whose self-confidence and arrogance is gradually worn away by the reality of a system which simply won't permit them to exist. Bai Ling is better as his Chinese advocate - realistic, dignified, recognising the need to work within the system as it as, and a woman of intelligence in a culture which does not value her qualities in the way they would be valued in the West. The Beijing setting is unusual, atmospheric and convincing. The film is gripping throughout and a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movie.

    Overall, this isn't a bad movie. It's a pretty decent courtroom drama - sort of "Law & Order Beijing." It's got a lot of suspense, and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso, of course, that the star of this movie is Richard Gere, and Gere is known for having a somewhat anti-Chinese (or, more accurately, anti-People's Republic of China) outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one - and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law (thank goodness!) but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you, you know that the basic message (even though you don't speak Chinese) is "get out of the way or we'll trample you!" So, yes, even in completely unthreatening circumstances, there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China. In this movie, Gere plays Jack Moore, an American businessman trying to close a deal in China, who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room, he's the prime suspect and it's clear that "the system" has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously pre-arranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue. All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the "one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China" scenario. Yes, Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer (played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai) who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence, but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom, he essentially takes over the case, questioning witnesses - even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much, and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still, it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.

    This is one of those average films one does not expect to have much substance. Unexpectedly though, director Jon Avnet and a script by Robert King provide the basis for a surprising hit. The essence of this film is called " Red Corner " and tells the story of an American businessman and attorney Jack Moore (Richard Gere) who visits China to broker a satellite communication's deal with up and coming Chinese businessmen. However, Mr. Moore has the unfortunate luck to make enemies out of unscrupulous executives.They set him up with a sexy Chinese girl who returns to his hotel room, where both strip, make love, get drunk and pass out. The following morning, Jack is accosted, arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of the girl. Unaware of Chinese criminal procedures, the accused has little to expect, except that execution is swift if he confesses. Pleading Not Guilty is not an option and is fully explained by his court appointed attorney Shen Yuelin (Ling Bai). Together they face an up hill battle to prevent his execution and prove his innocence. Versitle actor (West Wing) Bradley Whitford) plays a U.S. consulate friend. The movie itself is filled with dark drama, exciting realism, scary prison scenes and brutality. Gere is incredible as he portrays a man on the brink of death trying to exonerate himself from a twisted government where friend and foe alike wear the same color hat. Terrific movie. ****

We don't get to know him at all before he is arrested and he is acting completely irrational several times during the trial. The worst moment in his movie is when he, after having successfully escaped and gotten to the US embassy, out of some misguided stupid loyalty to his Chinese lawyer,gives himself up again to the Chinese authority, knowing they will shoot him even though he is innocent. At that point I was thinking: this guy is a moron with a death wish, just shoot him already so the movie can end. And during his escape he can outrun and out-bike-ride armed men, some of the on motorcycles. Give me a break. Don't waste time on this crap unless you have trouble sleeping. In that case this movie is the perfect sleeping pill. The

    I have watched this movie many times! When i first watched it, i remember it generating a very sinister atmosphere! There was no flaws in the action, acting, the cinematography, the score or the plot. On another note, I agree it is easy to see it as a negative portrayal of the Chinese, but perhaps not. As many have said, it may actually be quite realistic to what would happen if a foreigner was accused of murdering a native, but not just for China, any country really. I think they make that clear by pointing out quite a few times in the dialogue, that China has a much larger population than America, but a much much lower crime rate. It was made obvious that this was meant to be an isolated incident and not a generalist view of all of China. THIS IS A MUST WATCH!

    Jack Moore, a high-profile international lawyer, is in China for business. Moore sleeps with a young woman, and wakes up to find her dead in his bed. Falsely accused of murder, Moore's only chance is his Chinese advocate Yuelin. The rules and laws are different, and Moore must convince Yuelin of his innocence and unravel the chain of events that entrapped him... One cannot deny that Gere is very good in this movie, it's one of his best roles without Julia Roberts being involved, but the whole thing is a little overlong, and very boring. It's not Geres fault, it's the script and the narrative just plods on and focuses too much on him alone and complaining that his earphone/telephone isn't working. But it wouldn't hurt to just have a couple of exciting scenes? The one scenes with him running toward the embassy is a little too late, another case of a deceptive trailer. so all in all, Gere is good, film isn't, and it all has a 'Rising Sun' feel to it

    Recently watched this movie on Netflix, and was pleasantly surprised. This is a very good movie and deserves to be rated higher on IMDb. I've watched many movies that are rated in the 6-7 range, and this one does not belong in that category! I am not a Richard Gere fan - as a matter of fact I even rooted for Bruce Willis in the Jackal... but I was definitely impressed with Richard Gere in this one... He is probably far outside his comfort zone in this role, and has done an excellent job. But the real star of the show is Ling Bhai. She has delivered an outstanding performance. I gather that only a few shots were actually shot in China, but you don't get that feeling while watching the film - you feel like the film was actually shot in China... I am not sure of the accuracy of the portrayal of the judicial process in China, but was it was refreshing to see something other than what we are all so used to with Law and Order. Overall, I recommend this movie. While it is not in the same league as "Primal Fear", it is definitely worth a watch... and it will keep you engaged for the entire film.

    You know, many people have been bashing on "Red Corner" saying it's not the real China at all. Whether it's or not, doesn't matter; it's a movie, the spectator has to know the difference between a movie and reality. If you really wanna know how it's like in China, search for it on Internet or ask some of your teachers... watching a movie isn't necessarily showing the truth. For instance, there's been made a film called "Turistas" that shows Brazilian people killing and robbing, and nobody is naive enough to believe that's the real Brazil. The same for "Hostel". "Red Corner" is an entertaining political/juridical film towards an American guy suffering a conspiracy from the Chinese authorities and finds a Chinese attorney who helps him. If you like Law and Sociology you'll probably enjoy it and appreciate the ending. The cast do their best and if you have a strong sense of justice, it will be very tense for you. It's just a shame that nobody has seen this film, I believe it didn't have enough publicity back when released.

    I picked this movie late one night as I was having trouble falling asleep and because of the mostly negative reviews I had read about it, thought it would soon put me to sleep. I am a fan of neither Richard Gere nor Bai Ling but found myself soon being drawn into the unfolding drama and getting more alert and interested, instead of drowsy, as the movie progressed. Both leads turned in solidly strong and very believable performances (Bai Ling really surprised me) and I really loved the handling of the developing relationship between their characters. Instead of taking a turn into romance or eroticism(an easy and tempting directorial path) the focus instead was on how they come to understand and truly appreciate each other for what each is, and isn't, to the point that both don't hesitate to take great risks for the other's sake. The depiction of mainland Chinese bureaucracy and corruption (at the time) is by all accounts, accurate. I found the courtroom drama tense and riveting. The ending is poignant and fitting, though in the end you can't help but wish they stay together. An under-appreciated movie. See it if you get the chance; you could do far, far worse.

    Jack Moore (Richard Gere) is an American TV executive in Beijing trying to put together a deal for supplying material to China. He catches the eye of a Chinese girl and they head off to his hotel room: the next morning he wakes to find himself covered in her blood and taken away by the authorities to face trial for her murder. He discovers that the Chinese justice system works on very different lines to the US system. With the help of a female Chinese advocate he begins to try to make sense of what has happened to him. This film is mostly a cross between a paranoia thriller and a courtroom drama, with some action sequences which don't fit that comfortably, and some interesting overtones about how to find justice in a system which encourages confession to obtain leniency, and a woman's place in a system which is, in some respects, strongly feudal. There is an irritating moment about halfway through where the plot is moved along by an accidental, fortuitous, and completely improbable discovery by Gere (he catches a bit of a TV broadcast filling in a convenient gap in his knowledge). Gere is good as a man whose self-confidence and arrogance is gradually worn away by the reality of a system which simply won't permit them to exist. Bai Ling is better as his Chinese advocate - realistic, dignified, recognising the need to work within the system as it as, and a woman of intelligence in a culture which does not value her qualities in the way they would be valued in the West. The Beijing setting is unusual, atmospheric and convincing. The film is gripping throughout and a thoroughly enjoyable and exciting movie.

    Overall, this isn't a bad movie. It's a pretty decent courtroom drama - sort of "Law & Order Beijing." It's got a lot of suspense, and it provides a fascinating glimpse of the inner workings of the Chinese justice system. I offer that last point with the proviso, of course, that the star of this movie is Richard Gere, and Gere is known for having a somewhat anti-Chinese (or, more accurately, anti-People's Republic of China) outlook. The view of China presented here is an ominous one - and that's not entirely fabricated. I travelled to China a few years ago. I never got in trouble with the law (thank goodness!) but still when you're walking through Tienanmen Square and a column of Chinese soldiers suddenly comes marching right toward you shouting at you, you know that the basic message (even though you don't speak Chinese) is "get out of the way or we'll trample you!" So, yes, even in completely unthreatening circumstances, there are vaguely threatening elements to being in China. In this movie, Gere plays Jack Moore, an American businessman trying to close a deal in China, who picks up a girl at a nightclub. She ends up being murdered in his hotel room, he's the prime suspect and it's clear that "the system" has decided he's guilty before he even goes on trial and the court flat out refuses to hear any evidence that supports him and challenges the obviously pre-arranged verdict. How Moore can triumph over this system is the issue. All that's pretty good. Gere's performance is good. The problem is the "one American man takes on the entire People's Republic of China" scenario. Yes, Moore had a court appointed defence lawyer (played by a young U.S. based Chinese actress named Ling Bai) who becomes increasingly sympathetic to him and wants to prove his innocence, but essentially Moore does it all himself. Even in the courtroom, he essentially takes over the case, questioning witnesses - even when his lawyer is there. That all was a bit too much, and it strained the movie's credibility too far. Still, it's an entertaining and suspenseful if perhaps implausible couple of hours.

    This is one of those average films one does not expect to have much substance. Unexpectedly though, director Jon Avnet and a script by Robert King provide the basis for a surprising hit. The essence of this film is called " Red Corner " and tells the story of an American businessman and attorney Jack Moore (Richard Gere) who visits China to broker a satellite communication's deal with up and coming Chinese businessmen. However, Mr. Moore has the unfortunate luck to make enemies out of unscrupulous executives.They set him up with a sexy Chinese girl who returns to his hotel room, where both strip, make love, get drunk and pass out. The following morning, Jack is accosted, arrested and imprisoned for the brutal murder of the girl. Unaware of Chinese criminal procedures, the accused has little to expect, except that execution is swift if he confesses. Pleading Not Guilty is not an option and is fully explained by his court appointed attorney Shen Yuelin (Ling Bai). Together they face an up hill battle to prevent his execution and prove his innocence. Versitle actor (West Wing) Bradley Whitford) plays a U.S. consulate friend. The movie itself is filled with dark drama, exciting realism, scary prison scenes and brutality. Gere is incredible as he portrays a man on the brink of death trying to exonerate himself from a twisted government where friend and foe alike wear the same color hat. Terrific movie. ****
