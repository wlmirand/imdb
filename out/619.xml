    Extreme Measures is a good, good mystery unraveling thriller. It's a bit bland is all. It's well worth watching, just a tad boring in smaller parts. Extreme Measures is a movie I quite enjoy. Hugh Grant is especially agreeable as Extreme Measure's dominating lead. It's nice seeing Mickey Blue Eyes acting in a quality something outside of his typical romantic-comedies, in fact, I so very well liked Hugh's job in Extreme Measures that I would strongly preference that he do more stout dramas. Dr. Guy Luthan was a great role for Grant, as I hope to see him starring in many more of the same roles in the future, oh wait, it is the future, and he didn't. Sarah Jessica Parker is so wonderful. I love seeing Carrie Bradshaw doing her strong female parts for a change-up, finding them even more appealing than her usually played damsel in delight. SJP is one super hot lady. Gene Hackman is great as Dr. Lawrence Myrick. Lex Luthor lays down a formidable villainous representation in Extreme Measures. Extreme Measures is good, I'm telling ya and I damn near rate it a 7, but it needed more added context to its good, intuitive story. Extreme Measures is a well made multifaceted movie.

    Watchable but ultimately tripe with mis-cast Brit Hugh Grant playing a pre-eminent ER doctor who happens upon an apparent conspiracy when he treats a homeless man whose fatal symptoms are unlike any ever documented. His life is subsequently thrown into disarray as he's framed, fired and facing the prospect of ruin, decides to seek out those responsible and uncover their motives. Strong cast includes Hackman as the eminent professor somehow linked to the mysterious death, David Morse as a shady FBI agent and JK Simmons as a doctor mentored by Hackman. Parker and Grant are out of their depth, and both badly miscast, perhaps courtesy of Liz Hurley's influence as producer. The dialogue is abominable and no matter how hard he might try to convince you he's a fully fledged doctor on the edge, Hugh's anxious f-bombs all miss their target, likely to instead draw howls of laughter from the peanut gallery. It's technically well made, features some moments of genuine tension, but is so clich&eacute;d and contrived that the ethical dilemma proposed by the plot just can't withstand the patent idiocy of the execution. Interesting idea, just lacks the depth, refinement and core casting needed to make it vaguely plausible.

    Absolutely ridiculous (with a few typical Grant wits) and more and more so towards the end where they ramble on for 10 minutes and HG looks like a big fool. Moral dilemma? It just uses the moral dilemma as part of a very badly written plot; don't say that it triggers any deep reflection! Would have given it a 3 - or less - if it wasn't for the few jokes in the beginning that at least made me smile for some minutes. I do not understand how good actors like GH can lend themselves to such nonsense. HG was still relatively young and might have needed the money at this stage. And to see Sarah J P "act" - how on earth would anybody hire here after this - but we know they did. Woody Allen was almost right when he said that in Hollywood they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows. He should have added films. This is garbage!

    This is a pretty good thriller and also a quite original one, for normal '90's standards but yet the movie never manages to become a truly great, tense or exciting one. The story is what's making the movie good but at the same time it's also the thing that is keeping this movie down. It could had turned into an interesting movie, that dealt with the issues of moral and medical ethics but the movie never really does so. It makes clear, pretty much from the start on already, who the good- and the bad guys are. And the good guys are extremely good, while the bad guys are totally evil and immoral. It's making this a very black and white and standardized thriller, that progresses in a mostly predictable manner, while still managing to throw in some good moments as well. But really, when watching this movie you just can't help but think how great it potentially could had been. It seems that all of the right ingredients were there but the film-makers just didn't really had a good idea how to handle them, so they went for a more safe and straight-forward approach. This really feels like a studio thriller, made to cash in on the stars that are all in it. But don't be fooled. Even though Gene Hackman is highly billed, he actually is hardly in the movie at all. Just a couple of scenes at the start of the movie and after that it takes a long while for him to appear again. He's only prominently present during the final minutes of the movie, as if he signed a contract that ensured he only had to appear in no more than 5 sequences with Hugh Grant. During those scenes he of course still outclasses Hugh Grant and makes you want to see more of him in his role. And while it was an overall good genre movie to watch, it still managed to annoy me with a couple of things. It's mostly nitpicking sort of stuff but still, it bugged me. For instance that the fact that the homeless people in this movie, who play an important role, never ever remotely look like an homeless person. All have perfect teeth and they and their clothes look far too clean. It's stuff like this that takes you out of a movie. It's also a movie that in the end is leaving more question than answers, especially when you start thinking back about it. It's actually a very unlikely movie, with a very unlikely story and main premise, that gets only made half believable while watching this movie. But just like everything else, it doesn't really push through and plays things far too standard and safe. A shame, since there was far more potential for this movie really. Definitely watchable but it just never becomes great in any way. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***SPOILERS*** Overlooked at the time of its released back in 1996 the movie "Extreame Measures" like a fine wine seems to get better with each viewing. More then just your average hospital drama the movies thought-provoking premise of sacrificing the few to save the many hunts you as well as its star Hugh Grant, as the overly conscientious Doctor Guy Luthan, long after its shocking and mind numbing ending sequence. Working grueling 90 hours weeks at the Gramancy General Hospitals emergency ward in New York City Dr. Luthan has seen everything there is to see in people being treated there. Thats until one evening when he comes across homeless and naked Claude Minkins, Shaun Austin-Olsen, who was found roaming the streets on NYC with nothing on but a plastic sheet. Minkins seems to have every illness known to medical science and before he can be treated he suffers what's called a complete metabolic meltdown dying right there in his hospital bed! Trying to find out the cause of Minkins death Dr. Luthan hits a stone wall in that his body has mysteriously disappeared, or was stolen, from the hospitals morgue. Told to forget about the now missing Minkins by his boss Dr. Jeff Marko, Paul Guilfoyle, Dr. Luthan instead tries to track down Minkins' fellow homeless friend Teddy Dolson, Andre De Shields, who's name Minkins spurted out just before he suddenly passed away. As things turned out Dr. Luthan finds out that both Minkins and Dolson were treated at the Riverside Neurological Center by non other then the famed and world renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick, Gene Hackman. What's even more puzzling to the curious Dr. Luthan is that both Minkins and Dolson's medical records have completely disappeared from the hospital's record files! As Dr. Luthan gets closer to the truth behind what happened to both Minkins and his friend Dolson, who's still out loose on the streets, strange things start to happen to him. His apartment is broken into by someone who has cocaine planted there to have Dr. Luthan both discredited and disbarred from practicing medicine. Knowing that he's sitting on top of a volcano that's about to blow Dr. Luthan with the help of one of his patients the street wise Bobby, John Toles Bey, tracks down the place where both Minkins and Dolson were staying before they ended up at Riverdale Neurological Center! In the underground tunnels in and around Grand Central Center Station with their fellow homeless known as "Mole People". While all this is happening Dr. Myrick has sent out two of his goons FBI Agent Hare, David Morse, and NYPD Detective Berke, Bill Nunn, to stop Dr. Luthan from finding out the reasons behind Minkins and Dolson medical conditions. If it ever came out what secret experiments Dr. Myrick was preforming at the center it would either put him behind bars for the rest of his life or ironically would save the lives of untold thousands of persons if they, with human beings used as guanine pigs, are proved successful! ***SPOILERS*** Despite being the villain in the movie you just can't be that critical of Dr. Myrick's motives. What Dr. Myrick is doing in his illegal experiments is trying to save lives by implanting the nerve cells of helpless and in many cases terminally ill homeless people into the spines of the cripples patients he's treating at his hospital. Eariler in the movie Dr. Luthan came across the same dilemma that Dr. Myrick faces, in saving one person at the expense of another, and ended up doing in a split second decision the exact same thing that Dr. Myrick has been doing without a second thought for the last couple of years! It's that disturbing fact on Dr. Luthans part that has him, at the end of the film, continue Dr. Myrick's work despite his misgivings about it! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Also in the movie is a homely looking, before she made it big on HBO's Sex in the City, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dr. Luthan's both friend and assistant nurse Jodie Trannel. Jodie as it later turned wasn't exactly as sympathetic to her friend Dr. Luthan's cause as she at first appeared to have been. As Dr. Luthan got closer to what was behind Dr. Myrick's secret experiments he was soon to find out that Jodie was somehow connected to them in a both major and family-like way!

    With twists and turns, this tale of mystery and suspense will push you further into the depth of conspiracy. With raw emotion, this story will hold your heart and question the choices asked and choices made. Through the eyes and soul of two brilliant actors, Gene Hackman and Hugh Grant, we find ourselves torn between two men sworn to protect life, but one man's crusade to save the lives of others at the cost of others clashes with another man's belief to not play God. But would we go to Extreme Measures for the future of a better tomorrow? Would we choose to sacrifice others to save lives? This haunting tale strikes deep and leaves us questioning long after the credits roll.

    Hugh Grant stars a ER doctor that happens upon a patient with complex medical issues (and dies). His tests reveal something quite unusual. Gene Hackman plays a well-respected medical researcher that has a secret research lab using the homeless to find cures to diseases. Thought provoking to say the least. Grant's character is ruined after he starts digging into the mystery of this dead patient's maladies, medical mysteries. He just doesn't know what sinister medical research he stumbled upon and who is involved. Sarah Jessica Parker was okay in the film but Grant made it work. Liz Hurley was actually a Producer of the film. Hackman played his character okay but not excellent as usual. It is a taught medical thriller than will make you think if medical research like the Nazi's is really going on in real life. The movie was ahead of its time. Micheal Apted directed it well. Lots of great supporting actors.

    Extreme Measures constituted the first big attempt by the inflated-ego double act of Grant and Hurley to crack America with their imported production. It was a serious project - Michael Apted directs. But even the middle-of the road reception of Nine and a Half Months in the States (co-star Julianne Moore moved on to become a mainstream and indie darling) couldn't prepare the audience for the square peg in a round hole that Grant produced. His performance is heroic in as much as he soldiers on despite his rather wet screen presence. I think it's the hair. Seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker's an anonymous love interest, Hackman's thinking about renewing his agent... I didn't mind David Morse, who does thinking thugs rather well. A failed experiment. 3/10

    Is it justifiable to kill innocent people to save thousands of lives? What if these people won't be missed by anybody? This fundamental question behind "Extreme Measures" raises the film above the level of a purely forgettable action-adventure story. Two different positions on this issue are represented in the film by doctors played by Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman. Most of the movie focuses on Grants investigation on the nature of the mysterious deaths of several homeless people, an investigation that leaves him to uncover the truth behind research conducted by Gene Hackman. In the meantime there's some routine, below-par chase scenes. It's all been done before, and better. An absolutely endless journey into an underground subway goes on for far too long. Hugh Grant is a surprising choice for his role but fares surprisingly well, despite his simply distracting hair. But what's really worth thinking about is the ethical dilemma. Is Hackman's abduction (and essential murder) of the homeless men a justifiable way to find life-saving cures Hugh's stance, that the men didn't ask to be heroes, perhaps makes the most sense, but the question remains. Unfortunately the film requires and unlikely (but once again competently done) shootout to put an end to the conflict. But the film deserves credit for raising the issue, an issue that could very well become increasingly relevant to life and research. 2/4

    This movie is very relevant in this day and age with the on slot of diseases and people who are searching for the answers. Hugh Grant playing the moral side of this left and right medical thriller. The big question brought up in this film is that of medical morals that have been brought up in many movies and in the thoughts of many people, " Would you kill many people to save lives in the name of medicine?" Hugh Grant is amazing as the hero Doctor Guy Luthan. His character works feverishly to find the truth of," What is going on with this mysterious men that come into his life, why his life is being destroyed and what is "Triphase"?" This is a good movie of Hugh Grant's and shows how he works well as a serious actress which I think he should go back to. Go rent this movie or check HBO for the next time it appears.

Extreme Measures is good, I'm telling ya and I damn near rate it a 7, but it needed more added context to its good, intuitive story. Extreme Measures is a well made multifaceted movie.

    Hugh Grant stars a ER doctor that happens upon a patient with complex medical issues (and dies). His tests reveal something quite unusual. Gene Hackman plays a well-respected medical researcher that has a secret research lab using the homeless to find cures to diseases. Thought provoking to say the least. Grant's character is ruined after he starts digging into the mystery of this dead patient's maladies, medical mysteries. He just doesn't know what sinister medical research he stumbled upon and who is involved. Sarah Jessica Parker was okay in the film but Grant made it work. Liz Hurley was actually a Producer of the film. Hackman played his character okay but not excellent as usual. It is a taught medical thriller than will make you think if medical research like the Nazi's is really going on in real life. The movie was ahead of its time. Micheal Apted directed it well. Lots of great supporting actors.

    Extreme Measures constituted the first big attempt by the inflated-ego double act of Grant and Hurley to crack America with their imported production. It was a serious project - Michael Apted directs. But even the middle-of the road reception of Nine and a Half Months in the States (co-star Julianne Moore moved on to become a mainstream and indie darling) couldn't prepare the audience for the square peg in a round hole that Grant produced. His performance is heroic in as much as he soldiers on despite his rather wet screen presence. I think it's the hair. Seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker's an anonymous love interest, Hackman's thinking about renewing his agent... I didn't mind David Morse, who does thinking thugs rather well. A failed experiment. 3/10

    Is it justifiable to kill innocent people to save thousands of lives? What if these people won't be missed by anybody? This fundamental question behind "Extreme Measures" raises the film above the level of a purely forgettable action-adventure story. Two different positions on this issue are represented in the film by doctors played by Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman. Most of the movie focuses on Grants investigation on the nature of the mysterious deaths of several homeless people, an investigation that leaves him to uncover the truth behind research conducted by Gene Hackman. In the meantime there's some routine, below-par chase scenes. It's all been done before, and better. An absolutely endless journey into an underground subway goes on for far too long. Hugh Grant is a surprising choice for his role but fares surprisingly well, despite his simply distracting hair. But what's really worth thinking about is the ethical dilemma. Is Hackman's abduction (and essential murder) of the homeless men a justifiable way to find life-saving cures Hugh's stance, that the men didn't ask to be heroes, perhaps makes the most sense, but the question remains. Unfortunately the film requires and unlikely (but once again competently done) shootout to put an end to the conflict. But the film deserves credit for raising the issue, an issue that could very well become increasingly relevant to life and research. 2/4

    This movie is very relevant in this day and age with the on slot of diseases and people who are searching for the answers. Hugh Grant playing the moral side of this left and right medical thriller. The big question brought up in this film is that of medical morals that have been brought up in many movies and in the thoughts of many people, " Would you kill many people to save lives in the name of medicine?" Hugh Grant is amazing as the hero Doctor Guy Luthan. His character works feverishly to find the truth of," What is going on with this mysterious men that come into his life, why his life is being destroyed and what is "Triphase"?" This is a good movie of Hugh Grant's and shows how he works well as a serious actress which I think he should go back to. Go rent this movie or check HBO for the next time it appears.

    Extreme Measures is a good, good mystery unraveling thriller. It's a bit bland is all. It's well worth watching, just a tad boring in smaller parts. Extreme Measures is a movie I quite enjoy. Hugh Grant is especially agreeable as Extreme Measure's dominating lead. It's nice seeing Mickey Blue Eyes acting in a quality something outside of his typical romantic-comedies, in fact, I so very well liked Hugh's job in Extreme Measures that I would strongly preference that he do more stout dramas. Dr. Guy Luthan was a great role for Grant, as I hope to see him starring in many more of the same roles in the future, oh wait, it is the future, and he didn't. Sarah Jessica Parker is so wonderful. I love seeing Carrie Bradshaw doing her strong female parts for a change-up, finding them even more appealing than her usually played damsel in delight. SJP is one super hot lady. Gene Hackman is great as Dr. Lawrence Myrick. Lex Luthor lays down a formidable villainous representation in Extreme Measures. Extreme Measures is good, I'm telling ya and I damn near rate it a 7, but it needed more added context to its good, intuitive story. Extreme Measures is a well made multifaceted movie.

    Watchable but ultimately tripe with mis-cast Brit Hugh Grant playing a pre-eminent ER doctor who happens upon an apparent conspiracy when he treats a homeless man whose fatal symptoms are unlike any ever documented. His life is subsequently thrown into disarray as he's framed, fired and facing the prospect of ruin, decides to seek out those responsible and uncover their motives. Strong cast includes Hackman as the eminent professor somehow linked to the mysterious death, David Morse as a shady FBI agent and JK Simmons as a doctor mentored by Hackman. Parker and Grant are out of their depth, and both badly miscast, perhaps courtesy of Liz Hurley's influence as producer. The dialogue is abominable and no matter how hard he might try to convince you he's a fully fledged doctor on the edge, Hugh's anxious f-bombs all miss their target, likely to instead draw howls of laughter from the peanut gallery. It's technically well made, features some moments of genuine tension, but is so clich&eacute;d and contrived that the ethical dilemma proposed by the plot just can't withstand the patent idiocy of the execution. Interesting idea, just lacks the depth, refinement and core casting needed to make it vaguely plausible.

    Absolutely ridiculous (with a few typical Grant wits) and more and more so towards the end where they ramble on for 10 minutes and HG looks like a big fool. Moral dilemma? It just uses the moral dilemma as part of a very badly written plot; don't say that it triggers any deep reflection! Would have given it a 3 - or less - if it wasn't for the few jokes in the beginning that at least made me smile for some minutes. I do not understand how good actors like GH can lend themselves to such nonsense. HG was still relatively young and might have needed the money at this stage. And to see Sarah J P "act" - how on earth would anybody hire here after this - but we know they did. Woody Allen was almost right when he said that in Hollywood they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows. He should have added films. This is garbage!

    This is a pretty good thriller and also a quite original one, for normal '90's standards but yet the movie never manages to become a truly great, tense or exciting one. The story is what's making the movie good but at the same time it's also the thing that is keeping this movie down. It could had turned into an interesting movie, that dealt with the issues of moral and medical ethics but the movie never really does so. It makes clear, pretty much from the start on already, who the good- and the bad guys are. And the good guys are extremely good, while the bad guys are totally evil and immoral. It's making this a very black and white and standardized thriller, that progresses in a mostly predictable manner, while still managing to throw in some good moments as well. But really, when watching this movie you just can't help but think how great it potentially could had been. It seems that all of the right ingredients were there but the film-makers just didn't really had a good idea how to handle them, so they went for a more safe and straight-forward approach. This really feels like a studio thriller, made to cash in on the stars that are all in it. But don't be fooled. Even though Gene Hackman is highly billed, he actually is hardly in the movie at all. Just a couple of scenes at the start of the movie and after that it takes a long while for him to appear again. He's only prominently present during the final minutes of the movie, as if he signed a contract that ensured he only had to appear in no more than 5 sequences with Hugh Grant. During those scenes he of course still outclasses Hugh Grant and makes you want to see more of him in his role. And while it was an overall good genre movie to watch, it still managed to annoy me with a couple of things. It's mostly nitpicking sort of stuff but still, it bugged me. For instance that the fact that the homeless people in this movie, who play an important role, never ever remotely look like an homeless person. All have perfect teeth and they and their clothes look far too clean. It's stuff like this that takes you out of a movie. It's also a movie that in the end is leaving more question than answers, especially when you start thinking back about it. It's actually a very unlikely movie, with a very unlikely story and main premise, that gets only made half believable while watching this movie. But just like everything else, it doesn't really push through and plays things far too standard and safe. A shame, since there was far more potential for this movie really. Definitely watchable but it just never becomes great in any way. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***SPOILERS*** Overlooked at the time of its released back in 1996 the movie "Extreame Measures" like a fine wine seems to get better with each viewing. More then just your average hospital drama the movies thought-provoking premise of sacrificing the few to save the many hunts you as well as its star Hugh Grant, as the overly conscientious Doctor Guy Luthan, long after its shocking and mind numbing ending sequence. Working grueling 90 hours weeks at the Gramancy General Hospitals emergency ward in New York City Dr. Luthan has seen everything there is to see in people being treated there. Thats until one evening when he comes across homeless and naked Claude Minkins, Shaun Austin-Olsen, who was found roaming the streets on NYC with nothing on but a plastic sheet. Minkins seems to have every illness known to medical science and before he can be treated he suffers what's called a complete metabolic meltdown dying right there in his hospital bed! Trying to find out the cause of Minkins death Dr. Luthan hits a stone wall in that his body has mysteriously disappeared, or was stolen, from the hospitals morgue. Told to forget about the now missing Minkins by his boss Dr. Jeff Marko, Paul Guilfoyle, Dr. Luthan instead tries to track down Minkins' fellow homeless friend Teddy Dolson, Andre De Shields, who's name Minkins spurted out just before he suddenly passed away. As things turned out Dr. Luthan finds out that both Minkins and Dolson were treated at the Riverside Neurological Center by non other then the famed and world renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick, Gene Hackman. What's even more puzzling to the curious Dr. Luthan is that both Minkins and Dolson's medical records have completely disappeared from the hospital's record files! As Dr. Luthan gets closer to the truth behind what happened to both Minkins and his friend Dolson, who's still out loose on the streets, strange things start to happen to him. His apartment is broken into by someone who has cocaine planted there to have Dr. Luthan both discredited and disbarred from practicing medicine. Knowing that he's sitting on top of a volcano that's about to blow Dr. Luthan with the help of one of his patients the street wise Bobby, John Toles Bey, tracks down the place where both Minkins and Dolson were staying before they ended up at Riverdale Neurological Center! In the underground tunnels in and around Grand Central Center Station with their fellow homeless known as "Mole People". While all this is happening Dr. Myrick has sent out two of his goons FBI Agent Hare, David Morse, and NYPD Detective Berke, Bill Nunn, to stop Dr. Luthan from finding out the reasons behind Minkins and Dolson medical conditions. If it ever came out what secret experiments Dr. Myrick was preforming at the center it would either put him behind bars for the rest of his life or ironically would save the lives of untold thousands of persons if they, with human beings used as guanine pigs, are proved successful! ***SPOILERS*** Despite being the villain in the movie you just can't be that critical of Dr. Myrick's motives. What Dr. Myrick is doing in his illegal experiments is trying to save lives by implanting the nerve cells of helpless and in many cases terminally ill homeless people into the spines of the cripples patients he's treating at his hospital. Eariler in the movie Dr. Luthan came across the same dilemma that Dr. Myrick faces, in saving one person at the expense of another, and ended up doing in a split second decision the exact same thing that Dr. Myrick has been doing without a second thought for the last couple of years! It's that disturbing fact on Dr. Luthans part that has him, at the end of the film, continue Dr. Myrick's work despite his misgivings about it! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Also in the movie is a homely looking, before she made it big on HBO's Sex in the City, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dr. Luthan's both friend and assistant nurse Jodie Trannel. Jodie as it later turned wasn't exactly as sympathetic to her friend Dr. Luthan's cause as she at first appeared to have been. As Dr. Luthan got closer to what was behind Dr. Myrick's secret experiments he was soon to find out that Jodie was somehow connected to them in a both major and family-like way!

    With twists and turns, this tale of mystery and suspense will push you further into the depth of conspiracy. With raw emotion, this story will hold your heart and question the choices asked and choices made. Through the eyes and soul of two brilliant actors, Gene Hackman and Hugh Grant, we find ourselves torn between two men sworn to protect life, but one man's crusade to save the lives of others at the cost of others clashes with another man's belief to not play God. But would we go to Extreme Measures for the future of a better tomorrow? Would we choose to sacrifice others to save lives? This haunting tale strikes deep and leaves us questioning long after the credits roll.

    Extreme Measures constituted the first big attempt by the inflated-ego double act of Grant and Hurley to crack America with their imported production. It was a serious project - Michael Apted directs. But even the middle-of the road reception of Nine and a Half Months in the States (co-star Julianne Moore moved on to become a mainstream and indie darling) couldn't prepare the audience for the square peg in a round hole that Grant produced. His performance is heroic in as much as he soldiers on despite his rather wet screen presence. I think it's the hair. Seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker's an anonymous love interest, Hackman's thinking about renewing his agent... I didn't mind David Morse, who does thinking thugs rather well. A failed experiment. 3/10

If it ever came out what secret experiments Dr. Myrick was preforming at the center it would either put him behind bars for the rest of his life or ironically would save the lives of untold thousands of persons if they, with human beings used as guanine pigs, are proved successful! ***SPOILERS*** Despite being the villain in the movie you just can't be that critical of Dr. Myrick's motives. What Dr. Myrick is doing in his illegal experiments is trying to save lives by implanting the nerve cells of helpless and in many cases terminally ill homeless people into the spines of the cripples patients he's treating at his hospital. Eariler in the movie Dr. Luthan came across the same dilemma that Dr. Myrick faces, in saving one person at the expense of another, and ended up doing in a split second decision the exact same thing that Dr. Myrick has been doing without a second thought for the last couple of years! It's that disturbing fact on Dr. Luthans part that has him, at the end of the film, continue Dr. Myrick's work despite his misgivings about it! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Also in the movie is a homely looking, before she made it big on HBO's Sex in the City, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dr. Luthan's both friend and assistant nurse Jodie Trannel. Jodie as it later turned wasn't exactly as sympathetic to her friend Dr. Luthan's cause as she at first appeared to have been. As Dr. Luthan got closer to what was behind Dr. Myrick's secret experiments he was soon to find out that Jodie was somehow connected to them in a both major and family-like way!

    With twists and turns, this tale of mystery and suspense will push you further into the depth of conspiracy. With raw emotion, this story will hold your heart and question the choices asked and choices made. Through the eyes and soul of two brilliant actors, Gene Hackman and Hugh Grant, we find ourselves torn between two men sworn to protect life, but one man's crusade to save the lives of others at the cost of others clashes with another man's belief to not play God. But would we go to Extreme Measures for the future of a better tomorrow? Would we choose to sacrifice others to save lives? This haunting tale strikes deep and leaves us questioning long after the credits roll.

    Hugh Grant stars a ER doctor that happens upon a patient with complex medical issues (and dies). His tests reveal something quite unusual. Gene Hackman plays a well-respected medical researcher that has a secret research lab using the homeless to find cures to diseases. Thought provoking to say the least. Grant's character is ruined after he starts digging into the mystery of this dead patient's maladies, medical mysteries. He just doesn't know what sinister medical research he stumbled upon and who is involved. Sarah Jessica Parker was okay in the film but Grant made it work. Liz Hurley was actually a Producer of the film. Hackman played his character okay but not excellent as usual. It is a taught medical thriller than will make you think if medical research like the Nazi's is really going on in real life. The movie was ahead of its time. Micheal Apted directed it well. Lots of great supporting actors.

    Extreme Measures constituted the first big attempt by the inflated-ego double act of Grant and Hurley to crack America with their imported production. It was a serious project - Michael Apted directs. But even the middle-of the road reception of Nine and a Half Months in the States (co-star Julianne Moore moved on to become a mainstream and indie darling) couldn't prepare the audience for the square peg in a round hole that Grant produced. His performance is heroic in as much as he soldiers on despite his rather wet screen presence. I think it's the hair. Seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker's an anonymous love interest, Hackman's thinking about renewing his agent... I didn't mind David Morse, who does thinking thugs rather well. A failed experiment. 3/10

    Is it justifiable to kill innocent people to save thousands of lives? What if these people won't be missed by anybody? This fundamental question behind "Extreme Measures" raises the film above the level of a purely forgettable action-adventure story. Two different positions on this issue are represented in the film by doctors played by Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman. Most of the movie focuses on Grants investigation on the nature of the mysterious deaths of several homeless people, an investigation that leaves him to uncover the truth behind research conducted by Gene Hackman. In the meantime there's some routine, below-par chase scenes. It's all been done before, and better. An absolutely endless journey into an underground subway goes on for far too long. Hugh Grant is a surprising choice for his role but fares surprisingly well, despite his simply distracting hair. But what's really worth thinking about is the ethical dilemma. Is Hackman's abduction (and essential murder) of the homeless men a justifiable way to find life-saving cures Hugh's stance, that the men didn't ask to be heroes, perhaps makes the most sense, but the question remains. Unfortunately the film requires and unlikely (but once again competently done) shootout to put an end to the conflict. But the film deserves credit for raising the issue, an issue that could very well become increasingly relevant to life and research. 2/4

    This movie is very relevant in this day and age with the on slot of diseases and people who are searching for the answers. Hugh Grant playing the moral side of this left and right medical thriller. The big question brought up in this film is that of medical morals that have been brought up in many movies and in the thoughts of many people, " Would you kill many people to save lives in the name of medicine?" Hugh Grant is amazing as the hero Doctor Guy Luthan. His character works feverishly to find the truth of," What is going on with this mysterious men that come into his life, why his life is being destroyed and what is "Triphase"?" This is a good movie of Hugh Grant's and shows how he works well as a serious actress which I think he should go back to. Go rent this movie or check HBO for the next time it appears.

    Extreme Measures is a good, good mystery unraveling thriller. It's a bit bland is all. It's well worth watching, just a tad boring in smaller parts. Extreme Measures is a movie I quite enjoy. Hugh Grant is especially agreeable as Extreme Measure's dominating lead. It's nice seeing Mickey Blue Eyes acting in a quality something outside of his typical romantic-comedies, in fact, I so very well liked Hugh's job in Extreme Measures that I would strongly preference that he do more stout dramas. Dr. Guy Luthan was a great role for Grant, as I hope to see him starring in many more of the same roles in the future, oh wait, it is the future, and he didn't. Sarah Jessica Parker is so wonderful. I love seeing Carrie Bradshaw doing her strong female parts for a change-up, finding them even more appealing than her usually played damsel in delight. SJP is one super hot lady. Gene Hackman is great as Dr. Lawrence Myrick. Lex Luthor lays down a formidable villainous representation in Extreme Measures. Extreme Measures is good, I'm telling ya and I damn near rate it a 7, but it needed more added context to its good, intuitive story. Extreme Measures is a well made multifaceted movie.

    Watchable but ultimately tripe with mis-cast Brit Hugh Grant playing a pre-eminent ER doctor who happens upon an apparent conspiracy when he treats a homeless man whose fatal symptoms are unlike any ever documented. His life is subsequently thrown into disarray as he's framed, fired and facing the prospect of ruin, decides to seek out those responsible and uncover their motives. Strong cast includes Hackman as the eminent professor somehow linked to the mysterious death, David Morse as a shady FBI agent and JK Simmons as a doctor mentored by Hackman. Parker and Grant are out of their depth, and both badly miscast, perhaps courtesy of Liz Hurley's influence as producer. The dialogue is abominable and no matter how hard he might try to convince you he's a fully fledged doctor on the edge, Hugh's anxious f-bombs all miss their target, likely to instead draw howls of laughter from the peanut gallery. It's technically well made, features some moments of genuine tension, but is so clich&eacute;d and contrived that the ethical dilemma proposed by the plot just can't withstand the patent idiocy of the execution. Interesting idea, just lacks the depth, refinement and core casting needed to make it vaguely plausible.

    Absolutely ridiculous (with a few typical Grant wits) and more and more so towards the end where they ramble on for 10 minutes and HG looks like a big fool. Moral dilemma? It just uses the moral dilemma as part of a very badly written plot; don't say that it triggers any deep reflection! Would have given it a 3 - or less - if it wasn't for the few jokes in the beginning that at least made me smile for some minutes. I do not understand how good actors like GH can lend themselves to such nonsense. HG was still relatively young and might have needed the money at this stage. And to see Sarah J P "act" - how on earth would anybody hire here after this - but we know they did. Woody Allen was almost right when he said that in Hollywood they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows. He should have added films. This is garbage!

    This is a pretty good thriller and also a quite original one, for normal '90's standards but yet the movie never manages to become a truly great, tense or exciting one. The story is what's making the movie good but at the same time it's also the thing that is keeping this movie down. It could had turned into an interesting movie, that dealt with the issues of moral and medical ethics but the movie never really does so. It makes clear, pretty much from the start on already, who the good- and the bad guys are. And the good guys are extremely good, while the bad guys are totally evil and immoral. It's making this a very black and white and standardized thriller, that progresses in a mostly predictable manner, while still managing to throw in some good moments as well. But really, when watching this movie you just can't help but think how great it potentially could had been. It seems that all of the right ingredients were there but the film-makers just didn't really had a good idea how to handle them, so they went for a more safe and straight-forward approach. This really feels like a studio thriller, made to cash in on the stars that are all in it. But don't be fooled. Even though Gene Hackman is highly billed, he actually is hardly in the movie at all. Just a couple of scenes at the start of the movie and after that it takes a long while for him to appear again. He's only prominently present during the final minutes of the movie, as if he signed a contract that ensured he only had to appear in no more than 5 sequences with Hugh Grant. During those scenes he of course still outclasses Hugh Grant and makes you want to see more of him in his role. And while it was an overall good genre movie to watch, it still managed to annoy me with a couple of things. It's mostly nitpicking sort of stuff but still, it bugged me. For instance that the fact that the homeless people in this movie, who play an important role, never ever remotely look like an homeless person. All have perfect teeth and they and their clothes look far too clean. It's stuff like this that takes you out of a movie. It's also a movie that in the end is leaving more question than answers, especially when you start thinking back about it. It's actually a very unlikely movie, with a very unlikely story and main premise, that gets only made half believable while watching this movie. But just like everything else, it doesn't really push through and plays things far too standard and safe. A shame, since there was far more potential for this movie really. Definitely watchable but it just never becomes great in any way. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    ***SPOILERS*** Overlooked at the time of its released back in 1996 the movie "Extreame Measures" like a fine wine seems to get better with each viewing. More then just your average hospital drama the movies thought-provoking premise of sacrificing the few to save the many hunts you as well as its star Hugh Grant, as the overly conscientious Doctor Guy Luthan, long after its shocking and mind numbing ending sequence. Working grueling 90 hours weeks at the Gramancy General Hospitals emergency ward in New York City Dr. Luthan has seen everything there is to see in people being treated there. Thats until one evening when he comes across homeless and naked Claude Minkins, Shaun Austin-Olsen, who was found roaming the streets on NYC with nothing on but a plastic sheet. Minkins seems to have every illness known to medical science and before he can be treated he suffers what's called a complete metabolic meltdown dying right there in his hospital bed! Trying to find out the cause of Minkins death Dr. Luthan hits a stone wall in that his body has mysteriously disappeared, or was stolen, from the hospitals morgue. Told to forget about the now missing Minkins by his boss Dr. Jeff Marko, Paul Guilfoyle, Dr. Luthan instead tries to track down Minkins' fellow homeless friend Teddy Dolson, Andre De Shields, who's name Minkins spurted out just before he suddenly passed away. As things turned out Dr. Luthan finds out that both Minkins and Dolson were treated at the Riverside Neurological Center by non other then the famed and world renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick, Gene Hackman. What's even more puzzling to the curious Dr. Luthan is that both Minkins and Dolson's medical records have completely disappeared from the hospital's record files! As Dr. Luthan gets closer to the truth behind what happened to both Minkins and his friend Dolson, who's still out loose on the streets, strange things start to happen to him. His apartment is broken into by someone who has cocaine planted there to have Dr. Luthan both discredited and disbarred from practicing medicine. Knowing that he's sitting on top of a volcano that's about to blow Dr. Luthan with the help of one of his patients the street wise Bobby, John Toles Bey, tracks down the place where both Minkins and Dolson were staying before they ended up at Riverdale Neurological Center! In the underground tunnels in and around Grand Central Center Station with their fellow homeless known as "Mole People". While all this is happening Dr. Myrick has sent out two of his goons FBI Agent Hare, David Morse, and NYPD Detective Berke, Bill Nunn, to stop Dr. Luthan from finding out the reasons behind Minkins and Dolson medical conditions. If it ever came out what secret experiments Dr. Myrick was preforming at the center it would either put him behind bars for the rest of his life or ironically would save the lives of untold thousands of persons if they, with human beings used as guanine pigs, are proved successful! ***SPOILERS*** Despite being the villain in the movie you just can't be that critical of Dr. Myrick's motives. What Dr. Myrick is doing in his illegal experiments is trying to save lives by implanting the nerve cells of helpless and in many cases terminally ill homeless people into the spines of the cripples patients he's treating at his hospital. Eariler in the movie Dr. Luthan came across the same dilemma that Dr. Myrick faces, in saving one person at the expense of another, and ended up doing in a split second decision the exact same thing that Dr. Myrick has been doing without a second thought for the last couple of years! It's that disturbing fact on Dr. Luthans part that has him, at the end of the film, continue Dr. Myrick's work despite his misgivings about it! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Also in the movie is a homely looking, before she made it big on HBO's Sex in the City, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dr. Luthan's both friend and assistant nurse Jodie Trannel. Jodie as it later turned wasn't exactly as sympathetic to her friend Dr. Luthan's cause as she at first appeared to have been. As Dr. Luthan got closer to what was behind Dr. Myrick's secret experiments he was soon to find out that Jodie was somehow connected to them in a both major and family-like way!

    ***SPOILERS*** Overlooked at the time of its released back in 1996 the movie "Extreame Measures" like a fine wine seems to get better with each viewing. More then just your average hospital drama the movies thought-provoking premise of sacrificing the few to save the many hunts you as well as its star Hugh Grant, as the overly conscientious Doctor Guy Luthan, long after its shocking and mind numbing ending sequence. Working grueling 90 hours weeks at the Gramancy General Hospitals emergency ward in New York City Dr. Luthan has seen everything there is to see in people being treated there. Thats until one evening when he comes across homeless and naked Claude Minkins, Shaun Austin-Olsen, who was found roaming the streets on NYC with nothing on but a plastic sheet. Minkins seems to have every illness known to medical science and before he can be treated he suffers what's called a complete metabolic meltdown dying right there in his hospital bed! Trying to find out the cause of Minkins death Dr. Luthan hits a stone wall in that his body has mysteriously disappeared, or was stolen, from the hospitals morgue. Told to forget about the now missing Minkins by his boss Dr. Jeff Marko, Paul Guilfoyle, Dr. Luthan instead tries to track down Minkins' fellow homeless friend Teddy Dolson, Andre De Shields, who's name Minkins spurted out just before he suddenly passed away. As things turned out Dr. Luthan finds out that both Minkins and Dolson were treated at the Riverside Neurological Center by non other then the famed and world renowned neurologist Dr. Lawrence Myrick, Gene Hackman. What's even more puzzling to the curious Dr. Luthan is that both Minkins and Dolson's medical records have completely disappeared from the hospital's record files! As Dr. Luthan gets closer to the truth behind what happened to both Minkins and his friend Dolson, who's still out loose on the streets, strange things start to happen to him. His apartment is broken into by someone who has cocaine planted there to have Dr. Luthan both discredited and disbarred from practicing medicine. Knowing that he's sitting on top of a volcano that's about to blow Dr. Luthan with the help of one of his patients the street wise Bobby, John Toles Bey, tracks down the place where both Minkins and Dolson were staying before they ended up at Riverdale Neurological Center! In the underground tunnels in and around Grand Central Center Station with their fellow homeless known as "Mole People". While all this is happening Dr. Myrick has sent out two of his goons FBI Agent Hare, David Morse, and NYPD Detective Berke, Bill Nunn, to stop Dr. Luthan from finding out the reasons behind Minkins and Dolson medical conditions. If it ever came out what secret experiments Dr. Myrick was preforming at the center it would either put him behind bars for the rest of his life or ironically would save the lives of untold thousands of persons if they, with human beings used as guanine pigs, are proved successful! ***SPOILERS*** Despite being the villain in the movie you just can't be that critical of Dr. Myrick's motives. What Dr. Myrick is doing in his illegal experiments is trying to save lives by implanting the nerve cells of helpless and in many cases terminally ill homeless people into the spines of the cripples patients he's treating at his hospital. Eariler in the movie Dr. Luthan came across the same dilemma that Dr. Myrick faces, in saving one person at the expense of another, and ended up doing in a split second decision the exact same thing that Dr. Myrick has been doing without a second thought for the last couple of years! It's that disturbing fact on Dr. Luthans part that has him, at the end of the film, continue Dr. Myrick's work despite his misgivings about it! ***MAJOR SPOILERS*** Also in the movie is a homely looking, before she made it big on HBO's Sex in the City, Sarah Jessica Parker as Dr. Luthan's both friend and assistant nurse Jodie Trannel. Jodie as it later turned wasn't exactly as sympathetic to her friend Dr. Luthan's cause as she at first appeared to have been. As Dr. Luthan got closer to what was behind Dr. Myrick's secret experiments he was soon to find out that Jodie was somehow connected to them in a both major and family-like way!

    With twists and turns, this tale of mystery and suspense will push you further into the depth of conspiracy. With raw emotion, this story will hold your heart and question the choices asked and choices made. Through the eyes and soul of two brilliant actors, Gene Hackman and Hugh Grant, we find ourselves torn between two men sworn to protect life, but one man's crusade to save the lives of others at the cost of others clashes with another man's belief to not play God. But would we go to Extreme Measures for the future of a better tomorrow? Would we choose to sacrifice others to save lives? This haunting tale strikes deep and leaves us questioning long after the credits roll.

    Hugh Grant stars a ER doctor that happens upon a patient with complex medical issues (and dies). His tests reveal something quite unusual. Gene Hackman plays a well-respected medical researcher that has a secret research lab using the homeless to find cures to diseases. Thought provoking to say the least. Grant's character is ruined after he starts digging into the mystery of this dead patient's maladies, medical mysteries. He just doesn't know what sinister medical research he stumbled upon and who is involved. Sarah Jessica Parker was okay in the film but Grant made it work. Liz Hurley was actually a Producer of the film. Hackman played his character okay but not excellent as usual. It is a taught medical thriller than will make you think if medical research like the Nazi's is really going on in real life. The movie was ahead of its time. Micheal Apted directed it well. Lots of great supporting actors.

    Extreme Measures constituted the first big attempt by the inflated-ego double act of Grant and Hurley to crack America with their imported production. It was a serious project - Michael Apted directs. But even the middle-of the road reception of Nine and a Half Months in the States (co-star Julianne Moore moved on to become a mainstream and indie darling) couldn't prepare the audience for the square peg in a round hole that Grant produced. His performance is heroic in as much as he soldiers on despite his rather wet screen presence. I think it's the hair. Seriously. Sarah Jessica Parker's an anonymous love interest, Hackman's thinking about renewing his agent... I didn't mind David Morse, who does thinking thugs rather well. A failed experiment. 3/10

    Is it justifiable to kill innocent people to save thousands of lives? What if these people won't be missed by anybody? This fundamental question behind "Extreme Measures" raises the film above the level of a purely forgettable action-adventure story. Two different positions on this issue are represented in the film by doctors played by Hugh Grant and Gene Hackman. Most of the movie focuses on Grants investigation on the nature of the mysterious deaths of several homeless people, an investigation that leaves him to uncover the truth behind research conducted by Gene Hackman. In the meantime there's some routine, below-par chase scenes. It's all been done before, and better. An absolutely endless journey into an underground subway goes on for far too long. Hugh Grant is a surprising choice for his role but fares surprisingly well, despite his simply distracting hair. But what's really worth thinking about is the ethical dilemma. Is Hackman's abduction (and essential murder) of the homeless men a justifiable way to find life-saving cures Hugh's stance, that the men didn't ask to be heroes, perhaps makes the most sense, but the question remains. Unfortunately the film requires and unlikely (but once again competently done) shootout to put an end to the conflict. But the film deserves credit for raising the issue, an issue that could very well become increasingly relevant to life and research. 2/4

    This movie is very relevant in this day and age with the on slot of diseases and people who are searching for the answers. Hugh Grant playing the moral side of this left and right medical thriller. The big question brought up in this film is that of medical morals that have been brought up in many movies and in the thoughts of many people, " Would you kill many people to save lives in the name of medicine?" Hugh Grant is amazing as the hero Doctor Guy Luthan. His character works feverishly to find the truth of," What is going on with this mysterious men that come into his life, why his life is being destroyed and what is "Triphase"?" This is a good movie of Hugh Grant's and shows how he works well as a serious actress which I think he should go back to. Go rent this movie or check HBO for the next time it appears.

    Extreme Measures is a good, good mystery unraveling thriller. It's a bit bland is all. It's well worth watching, just a tad boring in smaller parts. Extreme Measures is a movie I quite enjoy. Hugh Grant is especially agreeable as Extreme Measure's dominating lead. It's nice seeing Mickey Blue Eyes acting in a quality something outside of his typical romantic-comedies, in fact, I so very well liked Hugh's job in Extreme Measures that I would strongly preference that he do more stout dramas. Dr. Guy Luthan was a great role for Grant, as I hope to see him starring in many more of the same roles in the future, oh wait, it is the future, and he didn't. Sarah Jessica Parker is so wonderful. I love seeing Carrie Bradshaw doing her strong female parts for a change-up, finding them even more appealing than her usually played damsel in delight. SJP is one super hot lady. Gene Hackman is great as Dr. Lawrence Myrick. Lex Luthor lays down a formidable villainous representation in Extreme Measures. Extreme Measures is good, I'm telling ya and I damn near rate it a 7, but it needed more added context to its good, intuitive story. Extreme Measures is a well made multifaceted movie.

    Watchable but ultimately tripe with mis-cast Brit Hugh Grant playing a pre-eminent ER doctor who happens upon an apparent conspiracy when he treats a homeless man whose fatal symptoms are unlike any ever documented. His life is subsequently thrown into disarray as he's framed, fired and facing the prospect of ruin, decides to seek out those responsible and uncover their motives. Strong cast includes Hackman as the eminent professor somehow linked to the mysterious death, David Morse as a shady FBI agent and JK Simmons as a doctor mentored by Hackman. Parker and Grant are out of their depth, and both badly miscast, perhaps courtesy of Liz Hurley's influence as producer. The dialogue is abominable and no matter how hard he might try to convince you he's a fully fledged doctor on the edge, Hugh's anxious f-bombs all miss their target, likely to instead draw howls of laughter from the peanut gallery. It's technically well made, features some moments of genuine tension, but is so clich&eacute;d and contrived that the ethical dilemma proposed by the plot just can't withstand the patent idiocy of the execution. Interesting idea, just lacks the depth, refinement and core casting needed to make it vaguely plausible.

    Absolutely ridiculous (with a few typical Grant wits) and more and more so towards the end where they ramble on for 10 minutes and HG looks like a big fool. Moral dilemma? It just uses the moral dilemma as part of a very badly written plot; don't say that it triggers any deep reflection! Would have given it a 3 - or less - if it wasn't for the few jokes in the beginning that at least made me smile for some minutes. I do not understand how good actors like GH can lend themselves to such nonsense. HG was still relatively young and might have needed the money at this stage. And to see Sarah J P "act" - how on earth would anybody hire here after this - but we know they did. Woody Allen was almost right when he said that in Hollywood they don't throw their garbage away. They make it into television shows. He should have added films. This is garbage!

    This is a pretty good thriller and also a quite original one, for normal '90's standards but yet the movie never manages to become a truly great, tense or exciting one. The story is what's making the movie good but at the same time it's also the thing that is keeping this movie down. It could had turned into an interesting movie, that dealt with the issues of moral and medical ethics but the movie never really does so. It makes clear, pretty much from the start on already, who the good- and the bad guys are. And the good guys are extremely good, while the bad guys are totally evil and immoral. It's making this a very black and white and standardized thriller, that progresses in a mostly predictable manner, while still managing to throw in some good moments as well. But really, when watching this movie you just can't help but think how great it potentially could had been. It seems that all of the right ingredients were there but the film-makers just didn't really had a good idea how to handle them, so they went for a more safe and straight-forward approach. This really feels like a studio thriller, made to cash in on the stars that are all in it. But don't be fooled. Even though Gene Hackman is highly billed, he actually is hardly in the movie at all. Just a couple of scenes at the start of the movie and after that it takes a long while for him to appear again. He's only prominently present during the final minutes of the movie, as if he signed a contract that ensured he only had to appear in no more than 5 sequences with Hugh Grant. During those scenes he of course still outclasses Hugh Grant and makes you want to see more of him in his role. And while it was an overall good genre movie to watch, it still managed to annoy me with a couple of things. It's mostly nitpicking sort of stuff but still, it bugged me. For instance that the fact that the homeless people in this movie, who play an important role, never ever remotely look like an homeless person. All have perfect teeth and they and their clothes look far too clean. It's stuff like this that takes you out of a movie. It's also a movie that in the end is leaving more question than answers, especially when you start thinking back about it. It's actually a very unlikely movie, with a very unlikely story and main premise, that gets only made half believable while watching this movie. But just like everything else, it doesn't really push through and plays things far too standard and safe. A shame, since there was far more potential for this movie really. Definitely watchable but it just never becomes great in any way. 7/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/
