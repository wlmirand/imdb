    I'm a New York City boy, have what I claim are the whitest legs in America, and I have never surfed, but I love watching Surfer movies (even the hokey ones from the mid-sixties). Endless Summer 2 is beautiful. Great video, and even the obviously staged bits work because we're all in on the staginess. The guys are likable and fun. One Kahuna of a Complaint, however, is--I want to Hear some of those Waves crashing. You've got great video, but the music often gets in the way of the sensory pleasure. I see beautiful waves, but the gift of the Sound all of that powerful water makes is taken away from me. Those beautiful sunsets and sunrises need Natural Sound, not Man-Made music. In Indonesia I wanted to HEAR the noise all of those cars and motor-bikes were making. SOUND puts the viewer there. You took all of the natural sound out, then added little bits around the music in the Edit. Keep the musicians OUT of the Edit Room.

    ENDLESS SUMMER II was written, directed and edited by surfer-filmmaker Bruce Brown with his son Dana 30 years after Bruce created the original. ES2 has much the same "feel" as the original but the technical quality is on a higher level with a much bigger budget, bigger production staff and a studio and sponsors behind it from the get-go. Problem is NEW LINE CINEMA was in a state of transition when the ES2 was coming to market and it never got the promotion that any film needs. Although it was made in 1994, like many people, I never even knew it existed until I was surfing the internet in 2006. This "sequel" is quite comparable to the original and if you enjoyed that, you will definitely want to see this. The photography is absolutely spectacular  much of it actually better than the original - and many of the shots literally take the viewer right INSIDE and UNDER the waves. Fantastic surfing, great action, beautiful scenery, magnificent waves, gorgeous color, good soundtrack  what a treat  like a 2 hour mini-vacation. The original seems more authentic but this film is excellent as well. Pulling off all the necessary logistics and photographing this round-the-world adventure and including some of the best surfers on Earth was a major achievement and an entertaining one at that. There's a little too much real-life risk-taking the film - much of it OUT of the water "playing" with lions and clowning around at the top of a precipice near a waterfall. Nevertheless, the film makes a great armchair adventure for those of us who no longer surf. It also serves as a beautiful inspiration to those who do enjoy surfing or might want to try it. Just don't be as daring as these guys. They've been at it a long time and even with that, they come up with some nasty wounds along the way. Interesting too that one featured champion surfer is smart enough to wear a helmet surfing the big waves over coral reefs. I think there's a good lesson in that.

    I found this sequel much better than the more-famous "Endless Summer" which had been made 30 years before this film. That was good, but this is far better and a big reason is better camera lenses and techniques. The photography in here is spectacular and I'm not a fan of surfing but this is amazing footage....and who isn't awed by huge waves? The camera puts you inside and underneath some of these mammoth waves and they aren't just spectacular; they are beautiful. As in the first film, the narration and the travelogue is interesting and humorous. Bruce Brown, the man who narrated both films, is consistently entertaining in this area as he navigates us to distant countries and islands. We see, for example, the beaches of Australia, France, Fiji, Alaska, Indonesia, Africa, on and on - just magnificent scenery. Also featured are wild animals, poisonous reptiles, a topless beach and assorted other goodies. It also was interesting to see familiar faces from the mid- 1960s movie and see how they've aged. It all makes the 110-minute film interesting for anyone, surfers or not.

    Bruce Brown's sequel, produced nearly 30 years later, is just as good as the first one. Once again, we join two surfers, professional surfer Pat O'Connell (who still surfs to this day) and his pal, longboard pro 'Wingnut' Weaver, as they travel around of the world to chase the summer, enjoying some intense waves, new cultures, and a whole lot of adventure. Brown's movie shows just how much surfing has changed since the first Endless Summer. Whereas in the 1960s, Brown showed the sports immense popularity of the sport for Pacific Coast surfers. But, if you'll recall in the first Endless Summer, some of the places that Mike Hynson and Robert August traveled to, they had never seen a surfboard before. Much has changed since then, as Brown reveals in the sequel. Right from the introduction, we see how crowded the Hawaiian shores are with every kind of surfer imaginable--long boarders, short boarders, males and females both surfing, children surfing, people surfing doubles or triples, people surfing with their dogs, body boarders, and everything else. The sport has come a long way since the first movie in 1966. In the Endless Summer II, O'Connell and Weaver travel to southeast Asia, France, Australia, South Africa, Hawaii, and Coasta Rica. In fact, they were invited to visit Coasta Rica by the original Endless Summer surfer, board designer Robert August. In France, the pair get to surf with world surf champ Tom Curren. I think it was in the islands of Indonesia that they meet up with Laird Hamilton and Gerry Lopez (remember them from 'North Shore'?). This is where Brown gives some focus to what extreme lengths surfing has been taken to as they gang go 'towing' with Hamilton and Garcia into some of the biggest waves surfers have ever known. And in between that, they get to do a whole lot of other great stuff (particularly with the adventurous prankster, Nat Young of Australia). The sequel is not quite authentic as the first one because of a few choreographed sequences. But, everything else is cool (despite the omnipresence of those Sunkist sponsors). The photography is great. The surfing is great. The music is great. If you love surfing, or at least watching surfers, this is still a great movie to watch. It's a lot of fun watching surfers living for what they like to do best: surf.

    A follow-up 30 years later shows how surfing has changed in that time. The same commentary style of Bruce Brown remains entertaining. The production quality is of course improved. And the surfing footage is still excellent. One could sense Brown's disappointment when he revisited Cape St Francis, the location of the "perfect wave" in the original to see that the wave had been spoiled by development - something that one who has observed NSW's North Coast and SE Qld's changes over the past 30 years will identify with. All in all, as interesting as the original, modified for a later era, and almost as good.

    I watched the original a few days ago, and I absolutely fell in love with some of the beaches and scenery that were in that one, as well as Bruce Brown's down-to-earth narration, so I might have put the first one up on a pedestal, but I really didn't like this updated sequel, as it was kinda like watching the Eagles in concert after they are all like 50 years old, or how embarrassing the Beach Boys were back in the '80s. The main sensory problem I got with this movie is the poor Gary Hoey soundtrack. The original had more smooth grooves to go along with the zenlike sport, but the Gary Hoey electric guitar kinda turns surfing into a violent and unsettling experience. The photography is still as beautiful as the original, but fails in the interesting department. Likewise, the movie itself seemed more forced. I noticed Bruce wrote it with his wife, and also there was some talking parts and some dumb staged humor (the original had the same, but they didn't resort to the real people acting and having dialogue, more of pantomimes). The only difference between this movie and somebody's surfing home movies is the better cinematography and the title of "Endless Summer", but other than that, you tend to lose interest in the film if you're not a surfer, whereas the original was about more than surfing; it was about interpersonal relationships and traveling aimlessly with a sense of adventure, not sight gags and a planned itinerary.

    I hate this film. Not because it isn't terrific. It's as good as good gets. My problem has to do with the films results. People all over the place watch Wingnut and Pat rip it up all over the globe and think, "Wow, I'd love to do that!" Next thing you know they're out in the line up trying to stand and getting in my way when it's already crowded enough. So I cannot stress this anymore...DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM. Watch "When Sharks Attack" instead.

    Whether you are a surfing guru or just a grommet, you'll love this film. Following in the footsteps of the friends that travelled the globe in search of the endless summer in Bruce Browns 1966 classic, Pat and Wingnut follow the surf from South America, through Africa, Indonesia and Australia. The photography is exceptional, the people they meet (Laird Hamilton, Jerry Lopez, Robert August to name but a few) fascinating, and the scenery incredible. Bruce Brown brings to the screen like no other can what is essentially an intraverted and elite lifestyle, and for the duration of the film, you feel a part of that life. It will leave you searching frantically on the internet for a longboard and a cheap flight to Fiji.
