    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores.

    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*. Or maybe it really was too subtle: the terrific special effects, gory dismemberments, and gratuitous nudity must have numbed the audience to the movie's message -- they either loved it as a dumb popcorn adventure, or loathed it as a purveyor of precisely the sort of ideology it was attempting to savage.

    The Milky Way is a barred spiral galaxy 100,000120,000 light-years in diameter containing 100400 billion stars. The bug planets are on the other side of it from us, at least 50,000 light-years away. Meaning even with the speed of light those asteroids would have needed to travel 50,000 years before hitting earth (talk about good aim). I think this information was given deliberate in the movie and points to a false flag attack. Also loads of death young people lead to a greater feeling of patriotism and willingness to endure a totalitarian regime which might be why the first assault is as dumb as landing on the most fortified area of the Atlantic coast on d-day was. But maybe that is giving the excellent screenplay too much credit.

    This is not a full review, rather a counter to those that say that this movie is an excellent parody of fascism. To talk about fascism is to talk about the past in a convenient historical way which means we don't have to deal with these concepts in the present. Sorry guys, Robocop and Starship Troopers follow the same narrative at different points in the future of the USA. Both films are squarely aimed warnings at only one country. There are no non-US values or cultures presented in either movie so I don't understand how this is perceived as a broad jab against the dark side of WW2 politics. It's a searing jab at the potential for the US based on its current trajectory. I watched this film when it came out, at the time the media segments seemed outright ludicrous. Now they seem like Fox or CNN is today. The flag waving, monitored, ill-informed people full of righteous anger are sending their children to die in wars they are entirely unprepared for and do not understand. Do we have to go back to WW2 to identify a country like that? It's a good warning. Forget fascism and apply it to now.

    Known as a cheesy b-movie, Starship Troopers is better than I expected. It is a gore-fest, it isn't big on intelligent script or scintillating wit, and is big on action but it has a bigger story to tell about a future utopia threatened and how society fights to save itself. It speaks about equality, it speaks about leadership that does rather than orders, it speaks of earning citizenship for all - not having privilege as a birthright and there are overtones of right wing military propaganda and the ends justifying the means. As Sci-Fi writing it is very good, and I'd like to read the book by Robert A Heinlein. The acting isn't superb, but Dina Meyer was excellent and very committed to her role - I liked her in Johnny Mnemonic - and Casper Van Dien was alright, but much of the acting wasn't superb lots of running around and shouting, except for some of the familiar veterans. It's rather gory and violent but much of the SFX are very good, others are quite shockingly bad. It's a mish-mash. All a bit gung ho and heavy on the propaganda aspects. There is something quite sinister about some of the wardrobe (reminiscent of Nazi/3rd Reich), and Neil Patrick Harris' character. It also highlighted the cruelty towards POW's being considered justified, the "brain" creature's treatment was quite disturbing. As a SFX/CGI sci-fi violent action film it was fair to middling, but as a deeper meaning futuristic sci-fi I'd like to know more and the film has more run in it's tank.

    Bugs! Bugs! Is usually what your internet dweeb Brandon shouts every time he sees a spider. Hola that's right I am back again for another review. If you get that quote then you love this cheesy sci-fi action, war movie as much as I do. This is a cult classic if I have ever seen one and too my surprise that this movie is in fact based off a book. This I never knew because apparently the book promotes fascism and a military style of world. Where the movie doesn't promote it but shows sort of what the world would be like if we did do such a thing. I just have to say one thing if you haven't seen the sequels and you thought this movie was fun, just forget about them because those sequels are terrible, I watched the third one and wow was that bad on so many levels they did not progress well. In case you don't know this movie is about a bunch of dudes that look like they walked right off the set from Aliens in a intergalactic war with a bug race known as Arachnids. These things very from the generic drones to big a** fire breathing monsters of beetles. The movie follows two character Jonny Rico who is this marine who kills the ever loving s*** out of some bugs and Carmen Ibanez who was Rico's ex who is a pilot and that's all she does. There are a couple of things that bug me, yeah I just made that pun. The first thing is in the beginning the aliens are hard to kill it takes almost three of them to take the bastard out. Towards the end of the movie they are dying from a bullet or two. It was very inconsistent in the terms of the plot and such. I also have to point out they "nuke" the bug holes and I have to say call it something else guys. I know I am looking for logic in a Sci-fi movie but if that is a nuke you aren't going to be only 50 yards away from the hole and be OK. It is Sci-fi make up a name for it then I won't question it. Honestly I've just seen this movie too many times I am reading way too into this film. It has a generic plot but I have to say damn they are not afraid to kill anybody off in this film. I won't say who but they cut there cast almost down to a hand full of people so be prepared. This movie for being a B Sci-fi film has some pretty damn good special effects. The Arachnids look pretty well done they don't look as CG as you'd expect. Unlike in the third movie where they look like someone did them on a lap top these are very professional looking. I also have to say the practical gore is just the best and this movie has gore. They aren't afraid to rip a guys face off right in front of the camera there is no shaky cam or cut away to hide what is happening. This movie was directed by Paul Verhoeven who directed two of my favorite 80's movies Total Recall and Robocop. What drives me nuts is most directors if the movie is based off a book will read the book. Not this guy he didn't like the book and made a movie anyways which I think he lucked out that this became a cult classic. I am curious what movie we would've seen if he read the book entirely. Normally I mention the screen writer because they are a lot of what happens in this movie but damn I don't know the lines in this film were bad. When I said it was cheesy this is cheesy, it also doesn't help the only good actor in the movie is everyone's favorite Michael Ironside. This guy is awesome in the movie; while the main character Jonny Rico ( Casper Van Dien) was way over acting. This guy is a big, big straight to DVD, or straight to cable actor and it shows. He over acted the s*** out of his role but I'll hand it to him being it was a B movie the guy was perfectly cast for this film. Overall in the end of the day if you are a film snob and you hate campy fun films then stay the hell away from this. If you are that guy or girl who loves Sci-fi and loves gore and that's all you need in a movie then pick this s*** up it is so worth watching. I have a weird love for this film I am one of its supporters I have to give it a B-. I give it such a high righting for a B movie because you have to see it and if you do and like it you'll want to own it as well. go to bloodyscreen.weebly.com for more reviews sucka.

    In some scenes the arachnids died after being shot a couple times, while others required 100's of shots! Hard to suspend disbelief when there are such glaring inconsistencies. Just a personal preference, but Dizzy was like 10 times hotter and more attractive than Carmen. Also, like most, I believe Carmen's hooker ass should have been the one to die off in the movie. She comes off as a disloyal, ditsy slut. What movie kills the hot chick and leaves the so-so looking chick alive, especially one with such unappealing qualities? That being said, the special effects were fantastic and most of the story line was excellent!! Too bad the sequel films in the series didn't live up to the first. I'm certain it had to do with budgetary concerns.

    Paul Verhoeven has created an unique futuristic world. It's a militaristic world at war with a race of insects from the other side of the galaxy. This is a simple shoot em up violent movie. You have to just enjoy the sex and violence. Casper Van Dien is perfect as the matin&eacute;e idol lead. For the hot action babes quotient, they have the sexy Dina Meyer and Denise Richards. And for their hard nose leader role, they have the perpetually angry Michael Ironside. The cast, the style, the violence, the bugs, all of it makes a great hoot. The CG is pretty good for its times. The spacecrafts could be better but the bugs look scary.

    Starship Troopers has to be one of the dumbest movies I have ever seen in my entire life. There, I said it. I am so goddamn sick of stupid idiots out there calling it "A jaw-dropping experience"(Kenneth Turan, Los Angeles Times) or "Massive, hilarious and thrilling." (Gregory Weinkauf, &Uuml;berCin&eacute;) Those idiot critics are f morons. There ain't nothing deep about this crap pile: it's a dumb sci-fi shoot em' up that only works about a quarter of the time. The story, what little there is, is that a bunch of space marines have to stop a race of fake ass cgi bugs from wiping out humanity. There are those idiots out there that are probably like 'But it has such dark themes such as humans being where they don't belong and questioning whether or not we have the right to exterminate a species" Yes, the movie does carry those themes but they are so poorly executed and used to no effect. If you want to see a deep, mature, dark, science-fiction epic that carries those themes and does them justice, well James Cameron's Avatar is for you (Then again, that movie also has its fair share of problems). Starship Troopers is nothing but a clich&eacute;, dumb as hell meathead war story. The acting in Starship Troopers is wooden, stale, and just bad. These characters are seeing the friends being torn to pieces and suffering gruesome deaths and yet they show no goddamn emotion about it. The dialogue doesn't fare any better. Some of it is so bad that it makes you cringe; it tries to add in some dark humor but fails miserably. The characters are unlikable monkeys that you never grow attached to and you begin to hate their guts over the course of the film. The special effects look like they were created on Windows 87', I mean seriously, this came out in 1997 and this is the best that they could come up with? Seriously? The positives that I have about this movie are the awesome action scenes and that if you can somehow manage to turn your brain off than I can see people enjoying it. Why this has become a cult classic is a mystery to me.

    Mobile infantry with rifles only? In future the air support is used to transport mobile infantry only. The space ships in movie are shown so huge but for what purpose so that Carmen can off dock it with precision and no air support to drop few bombs. Get real. Only couple nukes are used in the entire movie seems to feel like nukes are not readily available in future. There are so many bugs and only soldiers with rifles to kill them where are few bomb drops could have killed all the bugs. The movies is not planned well to depict the real war? The movie has good special effects and I guess that's the only reason I watched the movie. Still fail to understand the reason for this movies other than showing Dina naked but rest is all to good special effects.

    I was reminded of this film when recently watching Pacific Rim. I found many similarities that in comparison I could point out moments where Pacific Rim could have been better. Primarily, there are the scenes as our young protagonists train for battle. Director Verhoeven takes potentially clich&eacute; and dull scenes and makes them edgy. While training, the drill sergeant breaks someone's leg during a fight demonstration. Students dissect a bug and the female lead vomits on screen. The soldiers shower coed. Then there is some dark humour. Verhoeven also pushes the gore to the extreme, including a scene where someone gets his brains sucked out. But once the action kicks in, there are many many huge effects shots that are flawless. This film was released before the new Star Wars prequels, and I distinctly remember thinking that this film has now raised the bar, and that expectations for Phantom Menace would have to be at least comparable to the effects in Starship Troopers (they were). I thought the casting was workable. All good looking, and given some conflicts to resolve. Although there is a scene where Casper Van Dien's math grades are posted on a huge public display. I doubt even in the dystopian future that schools would be allow anyone to look up other student's scores. Other side characters add a lot of humour and thrills, keeping the film interesting as it explores their lives. I was disappointed with the dull character exposition in Pacific Rim, and felt the director should have taken cues from this film. I got the impression when Verhoeven first took on this project, he looked for ways to add excitement, including the character exposition.

    This movie worked on me the first time I saw it, just like a good propaganda movie should. Had there been a recruiting booth in the cinema, I'd have joined the Mobile Infantry. (I was 14, so hopefully they'd have rejected me). As the years passed and I became slightly smarter, I noticed the other ways "Starship Troopers" works. As a jingoistic wartime battle epic, it is pitch-perfect. The shallow characters engaged in their juvenile love triangle are straight out of a 1940's Warner Bros. movie -- except with the genders swapped. The hypotenuse of the triangle is killed off, and the surviving heroes realize that there are bigger, more important things than their measly little lives. Like those old films, "Starship Troopers" depicts heroes whose struggles and sacrifices contribute little or nothing to the big picture, but illustrate what the average citizen can hope to contribute to the great patriotic war. The ending -- "They'll keep fighting, and they'll win!" -- is quoted almost verbatim from the rousing finales of dozens of studio recruitment ads. Along the way little hints are dropped that not all is as it seems -- that we're being carefully conned into rooting for the wrong team. The very beginning of the movie tells us that the war with the bugs was started when Mormon extremists colonized a bug planet: the humans were the aggressors. We are assured that the bugs are mindless creatures, but we're never told how they've settled on so many planets. The asteroid that wipes out Buenos Aires is the icing on the cake: how did the bugs hurl that rock through space, and how did they manage to hit such a tiny target on a planet that's mostly water? Even the scenery throughout makes you scratch your head: why are we fighting over the Badlands and Hell's Half-Acre? In the end it's not at all subtle. It's subversive, but it wields its satire with a sledgehammer. War turns beautiful young people into mindless fascists, *just as it's doing to the audience*.
