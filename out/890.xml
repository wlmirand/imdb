    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

    ."Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is nowhere near an uplifting tear-jerker, or a movie that you can cuddle up with date or a chilling suspense thriller. It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over. "I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot."

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over. "I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot."

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

    ."Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is nowhere near an uplifting tear-jerker, or a movie that you can cuddle up with date or a chilling suspense thriller. It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

    ."Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is nowhere near an uplifting tear-jerker, or a movie that you can cuddle up with date or a chilling suspense thriller. It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over. "I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot."

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over. "I've seen that tattoo before, on a robot."

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

    ."Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is nowhere near an uplifting tear-jerker, or a movie that you can cuddle up with date or a chilling suspense thriller. It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10

    I have always loved the MK games and as I grew older and the games more complex, I also really began to appreciate the storyline. Of course the first movie didn't follow the original story much at all aside from a few nods, it was a decent action movie that left plenty of room for a promising sequel. MKA is an atrocious piece if work, however, and I would've rated it lower had I not wanted to like this film due to its vast (yet ultimately unrealized) scope and its (rather pathetic) attempt at integrating much of the storyline from MK2 and MK3 (along with a mutated and ineffectual pinch of MK4 - "Raiden, I am your father!" said Shinnok.) One major flaw is the sharp decline in acting quality. The first film featured some rather austere performances, but they were punctuated with bits of humor and as much emotion and likability one could expect. Only 2 actors return to MKA and neither are given much of a chance to act due to the endless fights and near complete lack of exposition. The rest of the cast alternates between cheesed out stereotypes and the brainlessly bland. Remar gives an exceptionally terrible performance as Raiden. Instead of the witty, mysterious, and sarcastic god given to us by Lambert, we have a puny weakling who tries to utter profound wisdom to our warriors but generally spits out complete nonsense. And when he's not doing that, he's giving out preschool-level speeches about love and unity and inner strength. Lets not forget the villains that speak with such pomp and bombast that they sound like a 13 year old level 27 dungeon lord of the 5th plane of the abyss. Of course the script is equally to blame. None of the dialog even remotely resembles human speech. I do sort of like how some story elements are used, but the problem is that they play no role in the central plot because that is one thing the writers totally ignores and destroyed. The games take place in such a rich mythology that I can't understand the need for hacking it up so badly. We have a huge number of characters with zero relevance, and big bad Shao Khan was a huge misfire. It's just some bulked up moron, no resemblance to the accomplished warrior, cunning sorcerer, seasoned general, and mysterious god-like being from the games. He's just a goon with other goons absent any clear motivation. I could forgive the murder of the storyline had a compelling film been made but its too full of nonsense to think of anything other than how it might've been made better by the inclusion of key plot points out of the games. It's fun to see characters I love come to life but equally disturbing to see such egregious mistreatment. MKA fails to honor its source and perhaps more importantly fails at being a coherent film. Most of it is one brainless fight after another with zero explanation or context interspersed with Raiden's infantile musings on hope and humanity and atrocities like the animality or, for instance, whenever any character speaks to another. Beloved combatants pop in and out of the film, while others exist only to die unceremoniously, there are far too many maniacal laughs from villains and the good guys are so wooden that you'll be wishing you'd been the victim of a gruesome fatality by the time MKA is over.

    Shao Khan, the Emperor of the Outworld, has illegally opened the portal between that realm and Earth. If it remains open, on the seventh day, all of mankind shall be destroyed. Now the Lightning God Rayden and four mortals - Liu Kang, Sonya Blade, Princess Kitana and Jax, have 6 days to find a way to close this portal and save the Earth. Along the way battling the evil forces of the Outworld and vomit inducing CGI as they proceed.... Yes, the first movie was fun, but in a silly Enter The Dragon on speed sort of way, and obviously a sequel was inevitable. I do not remember this film being that bad though when first released, now I know the error of my ways, and seeing it again, it's easily one of the worst sequels ever made. The fights are lethargic and awfully choreographed, Soto looks embarrassed, and Shou just looks oblivious to what is going on, no wonder he shaved his hair off. And this, being 1997, the CGI is awful, Super Nintendo awful, and it really puts you off the film, its worse than Spawn. There is nothing redeeming to this film, the soundtrack feels forced, and all who were involved should be highly ashamed. I took a girlfriend to see this when released, I haven't seen her in over ten years, and if you are reading this, I am truly sorry....

    ."Mortal Kombat: Annihilation" is nowhere near an uplifting tear-jerker, or a movie that you can cuddle up with date or a chilling suspense thriller. It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

It's the continuation of the 1995 video game adaptation. In the first "Mortal Kombat" instalment, Lord Rayden has appointed three experienced fighters to challenge against the forces of evil. There's the skilled and disciplined Liu Kang, the beautiful, but dangerous SWAT team leader Lt. Sonya Blade and the arrogant but lethal action film star Johnny Cage. These three heroes in defense of planet Earth compete in high profile tournament against competitors from other dimensions. Princess Kitana (Talisa Soto) proved to be worthwhile alliance in helping Rayden's fighters emerge victorious. In the follow-up our fierce heroes are in another perilous situation. Evil Outworld Empire Shao Khan has plotted an initiative to destroy Lord Rayden and his comrades once and for all and to take over the Earth along with another merging dimension. Khan succeeds in destroying Cage, kidnaps Kitana and establishes a death trap for the good guys and plots his worldly takeover accompanied by rocket-propelled ninjas, a zombie-like queen, a monster that resembles a centaur, scorpion manifestations, an army of skilled martial artists and a deadly sibling duo. With Cage out of the equation, Lt. Blade recruits SWAT member Jax and that's when the #$%$-kicking begins. Will good conquer evil? Surely the mature adult demographics will easily dismiss this silly nonsensical action film, but I have news for you adults. This movie is not for adults. It's custom made for adolescents and action junkies to enjoy. If you liked the first "Mortal Kombat" movie with it's rapid-paced high-flying action from the male and female leads, then this movie provides the same adrenaline here. For those who are into the technical features well it's pure eye-candy to say the least. The special-effects are remarkable, the fighting scenarios are vibrant and colourful and and the fight-scenes are brilliantly exhibited. The technical aspects a re triumphant due largely to director John Leonetti who was the cinematographer in the last "Mortal Kombat" movie. The fighting scenes provides a cornucopia of different styles of martial arts kicks and even the CGI characters display some impressive moves too. It's like a Battle of the Titans pitting American action hero fighting against the Hong Kong style of wushu. The production values worked out quite nicely thank mainly to "Terminator 2" producer Lawrence Kasanoff. Robin Shou who starred in the other "Mortal Kombat" movie, has come a long way. From his humble childhood in Hong Kong to migrate in the City of Angels and earned his degree in civil engineering at CSU in Los Angeles. Only to move back to Hong Kong to don his skills as a stuntman and would later show his acting chops by playing villains. Nine years later, he returns to California to attend a friend's BBQ where an agent suggested that he audition for the part of Liu Kang and to showcase his wushu fighting style which is juxtapose of martial arts and cinematic presentation. Shou was so excited he sold his car and skipped the country to China to study the art of wushu.

    I still remember seeing this movie. At the time, I was enamored with all things Mortal Kombat and I greatly enjoyed the first film even though I knew it wouldn't sweep the Oscars. So when the movie theater I worked at put this poster up I just KNEW I had to see it. And I did. Thus it is with great trepidation that I write this reluctant review. I really wanted so much to like this movie but... I just can't. Where to begin? Well, obviously for those who saw the first movie, some key players got Darrined. Sonya, Johnny Cage, and Rayden are all played by different actors. The only problem I had with the new actors was the usual disappointment of getting attached to the originals. Believe it or not, I actually preferred the new Sonya as she seemed more badass and true to the original game character design. Johnny isn't around long enough for you to hate him and James Remar is OK, but he's no Lambert. If only Sandra Hess had been in the first one instead of the lame Bridgette Wilson. The plot is just all over the map in this one. Rules are established then broken without explanation. Plot twists are introduced then forgotten. There's mystic nonsense about elder gods, Kitana having to reunite with her mother to save the world, Shao Khan being able to do whatever he wants because of Kitana's mother, finding your inner animality and Rayden giving up his immortality. Liu Kang is given three tests by a magical Native American but the movie forgets the other two and apparently courageousness means being able to resist a hot woman in a bikini. Sonya rescues Jax who has been given bionic metal arms because... your guess is good as mine. SubZero shows up to offer assistance to the heroes at a later time but later never comes. Kitana gets to play damsel in distress. Motaro and Sheeva hate each other but we have no idea why. Rain gets killed because he didn't make his victims suffer enough. Nobody seems to wonder where the rest of the people on earth disappeared to. Jade turns traitor because the script says so, I guess. Most people also cite that Johnny Cage is unceremoniously killed off at the beginning but his death was actually a plot point in MK3 (the game was on MK4 when the movie came out) so I can understand why they did it. The rest of it, who knows? The dialogue and acting are just bad. It's fitting that Shao Kahn and Sindel are king and queen because in terms of acting, they are made of ham. Musetta Vander gets such awful dialogue that one wonders if she wasn't overacting on purpose and Brian Thompson is impossible to take seriously because of his scene-chewing delivery and less than imposing stature. Both Rayden and Sonya feel the need to comment on new hairstyles and the importance of personal hygiene in the middle of an apocalypse. Jax is another stereotypical black dude with attitude and Irina Pataneva (Jade) once again proves that walking down a runway does not automatically translate into acting ability. I would comment on the other characters' acting ability but therein lies another problem: most of the characters aren't on screen long enough to actually act. Characters are thrown into the middle of the action, most without proper introduction only to be killed or forgotten seconds later, some of them without even fighting. Outsiders to the Mortal Kombat game franchise will have no idea who most of these people are and fans of the games will only see their favorite characters long enough to say "Yep, that's Baraka," "Yep, that's Mileena." The movie ends up being a cavalcade of cameos due to the disproportionally short running time and does the already flimsy plot no favors. Every bad movie, of course, has one area that it excels at in terms of badness, and while the above examples are certainly worthy contenders, the special effects truly get the ultimate razzie here. I'm not one to pick on special effects too much but even I could tell these were bad. Highlights include the laughably bad CGI wall monster, the green screen lab explosion, the shapeshifter showdown between Liu Kang and Shao Kahn that looks straight out of the mind of Ray Harryhausen, and Motaro. Just... Motaro. They say that an actual Sheeva fight was originally planned but scrapped due to budget constraints. Judging by the effects they actually DID keep, that was probably a wise decision. It pains me to have to trash this movie. I wanted so much to like it. I really did. But even as I watched it in the movie theater a week after opening, the whole thing just felt off. It almost played out like a parody or cheap knockoff of the first film. I also couldn't help but noticing that after the first weekend, the audience had all but vanished. Perhaps I should've taken the hint.

    This movie is just terrible but yet so good. The acting is just atrocious the dialouge is very corny the cgi is so bad it looked like a freaking toddler made it.But yet it is one of the most entertaining films I have ever seen. But who could forget such memorable lines such as mother you're alive too bad you will die; suckers; mankind shall rest in peace; destroy everything and I am proud to die a mortal. One of the major flaws in this film was there were way too many characters that had very little screen time and were not even mentioned by name such as rain; mileena; baraka; cyrax; smoke; ermac and noob saibot. Shao Kahn looks like a masked wrestler. I would highly recommend this film if you want a good laugh.

    We have seen some bad sequels and one that comes to mind is Highlander, but this one beats it by a mile. It is so bad that one can wonder how on Earth did it cost 30 million dollars? Starting with the screenplay, if there was one, this movie simply has no continuity whatsoever...no storyline, no development - just a bunch of characters walking around a badly prepared stage fighting. The staging is so terrible, you probably won't see it in a high school play. It leaves you with the impression that the "long journey" is actually happening in a two-bedroom house. The special effects are pathetic and you can actually see the faults in something as simple as shades. Some of the fight scenes are obviously taken in front of a green screen. The acting is beyond tragic. No shocks here as nobody would expect the cast to actually act something that has no purpose and is not really going anywhere. Some of the lines are like written by a 9 year old on two beers. Tens of new characters are presented without any history or connection to anybody or anything. If all that wasn't enough, the director seems like he took a day off as some scenes include awkward pieces of body parts being focused on while the character is saying something. If there was a nomination for the worse 10+ million dollar movie in history, this one will get it for sure!

    I thought the first Mortal Kombat movie was very enjoyable. It is probably one of the best movies adapted from a video game. But this movie is an absolute piece of trash. Most of the actors from the first film were replaced with other actors, there is a different director, and too many plot holes going on. All of the new actors played their roles absolutely badly. What was the director thinking. The direction was just a total disaster. The director of this film does not know how to properly plan a scene. One of the worst movies ever made. Do not bother watching it. It is just going to be a waste of your time and money. An absolute mess.

    There is no redeeming quality to this movie...Its just...Bad, plain and simple. The plot is bad, The acting is terrible, The fight scene's in this movie are among the worst I've ever seen in a Martial Arts movie. The first Mortal Kombat movie had well scripted and choreographed fights...This one relies on fancy camera work and has a whole ''Smoke and Mirrors'' vibe about the fights. Simply put, this movie was made as nothing more than a cash cow, seeing as the first Mortal Kombat did better than expected both at the box office and with fans. They made this movie with no real intent to make it a worthy sequel. Literally within the first 5 minutes of the movie the much loved comic relief from the first movie ''Johnny Cage'' gets into an altercation with Sho-Kahn ''Evil Bad Guy'' in which Sho-Kahn gets the upper hand and after a few tense moments snaps Johnny Cage's neck effectively killing his character out of the movie. It makes no sense than Johnny Cage, The man who single handily defeated Scorpion and Goro ''Two very tough Mortal Kombat opponents'' in the first movie, is so feebly destroyed in the second movie. The movie only goes down hill from there. The fights are stupid and Power Ranger Esq, the acting is sub-par...Even by bad acting standards. This film is also victim of a major cast overhaul...And not for the better. Most likely because the original cast read the pathetic script and said no way am I going to be in this piece of crap movie! And lets not forget the TERRIBLE CGI used in this movie...One of the downsides to the first MK movie was the weak CGI...But MKA takes weak CGI to a whole new level of bad. Overall this movie was SO bad...I wish that I could go back in time to 1996 and save my mom the money it cost to buy two movie tickets for this crap movie AND save her from the offal boredom she must have felt sitting threw this embarrassingly bad piece of trash movie. As far as I am concerned the story of Mortal Kombat ended with the first movie. MKA does not even exists to me.

    No no this can not be described in one word, as a kid I loved to play MK I remember when I spared no money for lunch in order to play MK when I saw MK Anihilation, I asked myself just who gave the money for this garbage that is being recorded. They destroyed the imagination of every child not just children but also adults who enjoy playing the MK, we start from the first Joohny Cage dies at the beginning of film, although knowing that Joohny Cage one of the main characters in MK, Liu Kang has a worse role than in the second the first part of the film, Sonya and that does not exist in the film because you can see her story rather than fight, Jaxx looks like it came out of the rap video, Syrax, Sector look like toys and remote control. Sindel's better not to describe, Night Wolf seems to be wearing makeup for Halloween, it should be one of the main characters in the film but instead it is a minor character who does not even fight, Kabal was killed we do not know how, probably someone did not put a chip, and Shao Kahn is expected to be the strongest character in the film and he looks like a sissy, Sub Zero is poor in contrast to the first part of the movie, Scorpion does not exist, Sheeva became black woman, an actor who starred Motar, is descended from the ship as an emigrant and had to play in the movie to get a green card, Rayden has a new hairstyle and do not fight do not even cast any spells as Lambert in the first part of the movie, Jade does not even want to describe it, and believe me, " Kitana "it is not Kitana from the first part, this is not even mentioned that her mother Sindel, and where Raptile, where the Nub Saibot where Ermac, where the Rain, they threw all the characters from the MK Trlogy and none described . John R. Leonetti who made the mask, and the scorpion king urgently a packed their bags and forget the movies, because this is miserable.

    This picks up exactly where the first one left off. If you didn't watch that one, you won't know what's going on in this at all. Johnny Cage is recast just in time to die, as Earth is invaded by Shao Kahn(portrayed by Brian Thompson, imposing as usual, and unfortunately a less memorable villain than Shang Tsung, though he does go for being as hammy... as does everyone else meant to be evil) whose men enter from the sky(no, really, it literally is raining men... hallelujah). On his side is Sindel(Kitana's mother), who was resurrected(after three days), and our only hope is for the two to be reunited. Yup, that's the entire plot(it's as obvious as they come... and it's got a ton of holes). They must have been very proud of this, as they keep restating it, as if expecting the audience to have an extremely short attention span. This would explain why this is almost all martial arts. And granted, they are well-choreographed, filmed and edited well... and devoid of impact, as we get no backstory on anyone(most don't even get namedropped). In fact, this has at least one new character(none of whom get development... even our leads only get what they had in the predecessor, if that) introduced per scene, and many of them don't stay beyond that sequence. We get no motivations, so they are as anonymous as the nameless henchmen in your average action flick, other than their costumes(some of which are done well). That's unless you're a fan of the games, and if you are, why wouldn't you be playing, instead? Oh, they tend to get to do cool moves, but that's really it, and you won't even know who they are if you didn't already. Is it that much of an attraction to see something on the silver screen that you can already help control? Evidently not, as this deservedly bombed. And the series of face-offs is the one thing this has going for it. Exposition is clumsily handled, the dialog ranges from bad to downright painful, and save for Dexter's adoptive father, no one in this can act. The tone is cheesy, not unlike Power Rangers, seen for example in the FX(of which there are a ton). For how much supposedly happens in this, I was pretty bored watching it. Not like I wanted to be doing other things, just that it never grabbed me, and I frankly doubt I'll remember much of this tomorrow. There is once again next to no blood, violence and gore in this. I recommend this to those wanting to see a bunch of humans and creatures from the MK universe duke it out. Anyone else, don't expect this to tell you what's going on or give you a reason to give a crap about anything you see. 1/10
