    "Bananas" carries the same mix of tender goofiness and self-deprecating romanticism than Woody Allen's first-feature film, confirming what it had already established : the emergence of the most promising comical and comedic talent. I still prefer "Take the Money and Run" because the film was more groundbreaking as the first comedy to exploit the documentary-format, a sub-genre that would be labeled next as 'mockumentary'. However, rediscovering "Bananas" is like an insightful journey into the roots of Allen's talent. Take the title for instance; "Bananas" as a double reference to the slang word meaning 'crazy' and the banana-republics (a derogatory term defining South-American dictatorships) has the same political resonance than the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup". "San Marcos" or "Freedonia"  like "Duck Soup", a fictional setting is the arena allowing to speak the most politically incorrect statements about human nature, and its thirst for power, in the names of such big words as 'freedom' and 'democracy'. But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles. "Annie Hall" would become the consummate -thus the most acclaimed- Woody Allen movie. And in "Bananas", you could tell there were some glimpses of "Annie Hall" through the intellectually engaging romance with Louise Lasser. The Allenian romance would be the director's signature. To close the Woody Allen's influences parenthesis, "Bananas" might borrow many elements from Allen's predecessors, but the film is original and unique in both style and writing. It borrows naturally a lot from "Take the Money and Run", through its clever mix of realistic directing and journalistic format style. The cameos of Howard Cosell commenting on a President's assassination and the aftermath of a honeymoon, with Allen and Lasser's delivery mimicking the way exhausted athletes talk after a match, are ones of the film's highlights. And it's quite an accomplishment to use non-professional actors parodying themselves to such hilarious extremes. This material isn't revolutionary, the parody has already exploited by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, but Woody Allen elevates them to much higher summits by juggling with other forms of humor, without never distracting from the core of the story, and even when it does, it's always redeemed by a hilarious punch-line. Many viewers would look at the film as a series of disjointed sketches, each one working alone but not necessarily making a good film altogether. I would understand the criticism if it wasn't for the pivotal element of the film, which is Fielding Mellish. As the central protagonist, he's both the actor and the victim of all the unfortunate incidents that fill the film with its zany goofiness. He's never too glorious to be a hero, but never passive enough to be a victim. He's just the way he is, and Allen doesn't need many efforts to make us laugh, he's so weird and incomparable that no matter which situation you put him into, it's a laugh-out-loud guarantee. And I can't go on without mentioning one of the funniest break-up scenes ever, when Lasser tries to find out what is missing in her relationship. They enumerate the different aspects of Mellish' personality that could have turned her off, and the list is so long you wonder why he's still trying to find the one reason. Still, the romance is never independent from politics, which are the subject of more mockeries than Mellish' character himself. Most reviewers would try to analyze the film on the basis that it was meant to be a satire and I think this is the best way for disappointment. I love to take the word "Bananas" as the most standard gag of a man slipping on a banana peel, this is what the film is: a big gag. Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

    I am not a big fan of Woody Allen.A lot of it has to do with his persistent slams against Christianity,which I don't find funny.This film does little to change my mind,but I will have to give him some credit here.At least he kept the religious slams to a minimum with this film.He took the basic elements of slapstick comedy that we had known throughout the years and incorporated it into a much racier period in film history quite successfully,but it's not enough to impress me personally.Slapstick is much more appealing to me without all the raunchiness.Give me the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy any day of the week.

    Interiewed by Photoplay Magazine in 1980 about their then-new comedy film 'Airplane!', Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cited Woody Allen's 1971 picture 'Bananas' as a major influence on their work. You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( "I smoke them...HE smokes them!", quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President... As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

    Woody Allen is at the top of his wackiness here as a product tester who after being dumped by his activist girl friend goes over to a South American country, joins the rebels and ends up becoming the president. the starting scene which is a live assassination and the end scene which shows the live broadcast of Allen's honeymoon night is side splitting. there is a one minute un-credited cameo by Sylvester Stallone as a tough guy who roughs up Allen in a train. the farcical situations are numerous and the satire in Allen comes to the fore in the marvelous court scene where he is gagged and bound and then goes on to tear the witness apart. this is vintage Allen and his fans would rejoice seeing this early work as the hand of the master satirist is clearly visible.

    When the aliens in Stardust Memories tell the Woody Allen character they liked his early, funnier movies best, this was the sort of thing to which they referred. The premise here is: what would happen if a coffee house philosopher got caught up in a revolution and wound up running a central American republic as its new dictator. As usual, the Woody character (Fielding Mellish) is a windbag who lacks the conviction of his posturing rhetoric and only gets involved in revolutionary politics because of a woman (Louise Lasser). The audience is taken along for a fun satiric ride through the messy tangle of political idealogies as the Woody dilettante soon finds himself among people with guns and convictions. And craziness...

    In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is killed in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos Montalb&aacute;n). In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him. "Bananas" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine "Orgasm"; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Bananas"

    I have started a Woody Allen month and this is my third movie after Annie Hall and Anything Else with Annie Hall as may favorite so far. Those other movies had philosophy of their own with great dialogs and very sophisticated humorous lines. But on this one Woody Allen just falls, acts clumsily etc.which I don't really appreciate for a comedy.Sure the movie as a whole very clever one with its topic and countless needles on the events of its time. Moreover the absurdity of the movie is incredible, the beginning and the ending sequences just blew my head, I just can't imagine the reaction this picture got in 70s.All in all this is not the best comedy ever but it is sure another piece of art from Woody Allen.

    To impress his political activist girlfriend, a product tester leaves New York to lead a revolution in a South American country. In Allen's third directorial effort, the jokes and sight gags come in rapid fire and of course they are hit and miss, mostly the latter. Watching this movie is like listening to a stand-up comic. It's amusing enough while it happens, but is quickly forgotten after it's over. Of course Allen realized this and turned to a more sophisticated brand of comedy after a few years. Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.

    In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is killed in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos Montalb&aacute;n). In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him. "Bananas" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine "Orgasm"; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Bananas"

    I have started a Woody Allen month and this is my third movie after Annie Hall and Anything Else with Annie Hall as may favorite so far. Those other movies had philosophy of their own with great dialogs and very sophisticated humorous lines. But on this one Woody Allen just falls, acts clumsily etc.which I don't really appreciate for a comedy.Sure the movie as a whole very clever one with its topic and countless needles on the events of its time. Moreover the absurdity of the movie is incredible, the beginning and the ending sequences just blew my head, I just can't imagine the reaction this picture got in 70s.All in all this is not the best comedy ever but it is sure another piece of art from Woody Allen.

    To impress his political activist girlfriend, a product tester leaves New York to lead a revolution in a South American country. In Allen's third directorial effort, the jokes and sight gags come in rapid fire and of course they are hit and miss, mostly the latter. Watching this movie is like listening to a stand-up comic. It's amusing enough while it happens, but is quickly forgotten after it's over. Of course Allen realized this and turned to a more sophisticated brand of comedy after a few years. Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.

    "Bananas" carries the same mix of tender goofiness and self-deprecating romanticism than Woody Allen's first-feature film, confirming what it had already established : the emergence of the most promising comical and comedic talent. I still prefer "Take the Money and Run" because the film was more groundbreaking as the first comedy to exploit the documentary-format, a sub-genre that would be labeled next as 'mockumentary'. However, rediscovering "Bananas" is like an insightful journey into the roots of Allen's talent. Take the title for instance; "Bananas" as a double reference to the slang word meaning 'crazy' and the banana-republics (a derogatory term defining South-American dictatorships) has the same political resonance than the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup". "San Marcos" or "Freedonia"  like "Duck Soup", a fictional setting is the arena allowing to speak the most politically incorrect statements about human nature, and its thirst for power, in the names of such big words as 'freedom' and 'democracy'. But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles. "Annie Hall" would become the consummate -thus the most acclaimed- Woody Allen movie. And in "Bananas", you could tell there were some glimpses of "Annie Hall" through the intellectually engaging romance with Louise Lasser. The Allenian romance would be the director's signature. To close the Woody Allen's influences parenthesis, "Bananas" might borrow many elements from Allen's predecessors, but the film is original and unique in both style and writing. It borrows naturally a lot from "Take the Money and Run", through its clever mix of realistic directing and journalistic format style. The cameos of Howard Cosell commenting on a President's assassination and the aftermath of a honeymoon, with Allen and Lasser's delivery mimicking the way exhausted athletes talk after a match, are ones of the film's highlights. And it's quite an accomplishment to use non-professional actors parodying themselves to such hilarious extremes. This material isn't revolutionary, the parody has already exploited by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, but Woody Allen elevates them to much higher summits by juggling with other forms of humor, without never distracting from the core of the story, and even when it does, it's always redeemed by a hilarious punch-line. Many viewers would look at the film as a series of disjointed sketches, each one working alone but not necessarily making a good film altogether. I would understand the criticism if it wasn't for the pivotal element of the film, which is Fielding Mellish. As the central protagonist, he's both the actor and the victim of all the unfortunate incidents that fill the film with its zany goofiness. He's never too glorious to be a hero, but never passive enough to be a victim. He's just the way he is, and Allen doesn't need many efforts to make us laugh, he's so weird and incomparable that no matter which situation you put him into, it's a laugh-out-loud guarantee. And I can't go on without mentioning one of the funniest break-up scenes ever, when Lasser tries to find out what is missing in her relationship. They enumerate the different aspects of Mellish' personality that could have turned her off, and the list is so long you wonder why he's still trying to find the one reason. Still, the romance is never independent from politics, which are the subject of more mockeries than Mellish' character himself. Most reviewers would try to analyze the film on the basis that it was meant to be a satire and I think this is the best way for disappointment. I love to take the word "Bananas" as the most standard gag of a man slipping on a banana peel, this is what the film is: a big gag. Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

    I am not a big fan of Woody Allen.A lot of it has to do with his persistent slams against Christianity,which I don't find funny.This film does little to change my mind,but I will have to give him some credit here.At least he kept the religious slams to a minimum with this film.He took the basic elements of slapstick comedy that we had known throughout the years and incorporated it into a much racier period in film history quite successfully,but it's not enough to impress me personally.Slapstick is much more appealing to me without all the raunchiness.Give me the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy any day of the week.

    Interiewed by Photoplay Magazine in 1980 about their then-new comedy film 'Airplane!', Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cited Woody Allen's 1971 picture 'Bananas' as a major influence on their work. You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( "I smoke them...HE smokes them!", quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President... As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

    Woody Allen is at the top of his wackiness here as a product tester who after being dumped by his activist girl friend goes over to a South American country, joins the rebels and ends up becoming the president. the starting scene which is a live assassination and the end scene which shows the live broadcast of Allen's honeymoon night is side splitting. there is a one minute un-credited cameo by Sylvester Stallone as a tough guy who roughs up Allen in a train. the farcical situations are numerous and the satire in Allen comes to the fore in the marvelous court scene where he is gagged and bound and then goes on to tear the witness apart. this is vintage Allen and his fans would rejoice seeing this early work as the hand of the master satirist is clearly visible.

    When the aliens in Stardust Memories tell the Woody Allen character they liked his early, funnier movies best, this was the sort of thing to which they referred. The premise here is: what would happen if a coffee house philosopher got caught up in a revolution and wound up running a central American republic as its new dictator. As usual, the Woody character (Fielding Mellish) is a windbag who lacks the conviction of his posturing rhetoric and only gets involved in revolutionary politics because of a woman (Louise Lasser). The audience is taken along for a fun satiric ride through the messy tangle of political idealogies as the Woody dilettante soon finds himself among people with guns and convictions. And craziness...

My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

    Woody Allen is at the top of his wackiness here as a product tester who after being dumped by his activist girl friend goes over to a South American country, joins the rebels and ends up becoming the president. the starting scene which is a live assassination and the end scene which shows the live broadcast of Allen's honeymoon night is side splitting. there is a one minute un-credited cameo by Sylvester Stallone as a tough guy who roughs up Allen in a train. the farcical situations are numerous and the satire in Allen comes to the fore in the marvelous court scene where he is gagged and bound and then goes on to tear the witness apart. this is vintage Allen and his fans would rejoice seeing this early work as the hand of the master satirist is clearly visible.

    When the aliens in Stardust Memories tell the Woody Allen character they liked his early, funnier movies best, this was the sort of thing to which they referred. The premise here is: what would happen if a coffee house philosopher got caught up in a revolution and wound up running a central American republic as its new dictator. As usual, the Woody character (Fielding Mellish) is a windbag who lacks the conviction of his posturing rhetoric and only gets involved in revolutionary politics because of a woman (Louise Lasser). The audience is taken along for a fun satiric ride through the messy tangle of political idealogies as the Woody dilettante soon finds himself among people with guns and convictions. And craziness...

    In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is killed in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos Montalb&aacute;n). In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him. "Bananas" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine "Orgasm"; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Bananas"

    I have started a Woody Allen month and this is my third movie after Annie Hall and Anything Else with Annie Hall as may favorite so far. Those other movies had philosophy of their own with great dialogs and very sophisticated humorous lines. But on this one Woody Allen just falls, acts clumsily etc.which I don't really appreciate for a comedy.Sure the movie as a whole very clever one with its topic and countless needles on the events of its time. Moreover the absurdity of the movie is incredible, the beginning and the ending sequences just blew my head, I just can't imagine the reaction this picture got in 70s.All in all this is not the best comedy ever but it is sure another piece of art from Woody Allen.

    To impress his political activist girlfriend, a product tester leaves New York to lead a revolution in a South American country. In Allen's third directorial effort, the jokes and sight gags come in rapid fire and of course they are hit and miss, mostly the latter. Watching this movie is like listening to a stand-up comic. It's amusing enough while it happens, but is quickly forgotten after it's over. Of course Allen realized this and turned to a more sophisticated brand of comedy after a few years. Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.

    "Bananas" carries the same mix of tender goofiness and self-deprecating romanticism than Woody Allen's first-feature film, confirming what it had already established : the emergence of the most promising comical and comedic talent. I still prefer "Take the Money and Run" because the film was more groundbreaking as the first comedy to exploit the documentary-format, a sub-genre that would be labeled next as 'mockumentary'. However, rediscovering "Bananas" is like an insightful journey into the roots of Allen's talent. Take the title for instance; "Bananas" as a double reference to the slang word meaning 'crazy' and the banana-republics (a derogatory term defining South-American dictatorships) has the same political resonance than the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup". "San Marcos" or "Freedonia"  like "Duck Soup", a fictional setting is the arena allowing to speak the most politically incorrect statements about human nature, and its thirst for power, in the names of such big words as 'freedom' and 'democracy'. But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles. "Annie Hall" would become the consummate -thus the most acclaimed- Woody Allen movie. And in "Bananas", you could tell there were some glimpses of "Annie Hall" through the intellectually engaging romance with Louise Lasser. The Allenian romance would be the director's signature. To close the Woody Allen's influences parenthesis, "Bananas" might borrow many elements from Allen's predecessors, but the film is original and unique in both style and writing. It borrows naturally a lot from "Take the Money and Run", through its clever mix of realistic directing and journalistic format style. The cameos of Howard Cosell commenting on a President's assassination and the aftermath of a honeymoon, with Allen and Lasser's delivery mimicking the way exhausted athletes talk after a match, are ones of the film's highlights. And it's quite an accomplishment to use non-professional actors parodying themselves to such hilarious extremes. This material isn't revolutionary, the parody has already exploited by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, but Woody Allen elevates them to much higher summits by juggling with other forms of humor, without never distracting from the core of the story, and even when it does, it's always redeemed by a hilarious punch-line. Many viewers would look at the film as a series of disjointed sketches, each one working alone but not necessarily making a good film altogether. I would understand the criticism if it wasn't for the pivotal element of the film, which is Fielding Mellish. As the central protagonist, he's both the actor and the victim of all the unfortunate incidents that fill the film with its zany goofiness. He's never too glorious to be a hero, but never passive enough to be a victim. He's just the way he is, and Allen doesn't need many efforts to make us laugh, he's so weird and incomparable that no matter which situation you put him into, it's a laugh-out-loud guarantee. And I can't go on without mentioning one of the funniest break-up scenes ever, when Lasser tries to find out what is missing in her relationship. They enumerate the different aspects of Mellish' personality that could have turned her off, and the list is so long you wonder why he's still trying to find the one reason. Still, the romance is never independent from politics, which are the subject of more mockeries than Mellish' character himself. Most reviewers would try to analyze the film on the basis that it was meant to be a satire and I think this is the best way for disappointment. I love to take the word "Bananas" as the most standard gag of a man slipping on a banana peel, this is what the film is: a big gag. Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

    I am not a big fan of Woody Allen.A lot of it has to do with his persistent slams against Christianity,which I don't find funny.This film does little to change my mind,but I will have to give him some credit here.At least he kept the religious slams to a minimum with this film.He took the basic elements of slapstick comedy that we had known throughout the years and incorporated it into a much racier period in film history quite successfully,but it's not enough to impress me personally.Slapstick is much more appealing to me without all the raunchiness.Give me the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy any day of the week.

    Interiewed by Photoplay Magazine in 1980 about their then-new comedy film 'Airplane!', Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cited Woody Allen's 1971 picture 'Bananas' as a major influence on their work. You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( "I smoke them...HE smokes them!", quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President... As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

    I am not a big fan of Woody Allen.A lot of it has to do with his persistent slams against Christianity,which I don't find funny.This film does little to change my mind,but I will have to give him some credit here.At least he kept the religious slams to a minimum with this film.He took the basic elements of slapstick comedy that we had known throughout the years and incorporated it into a much racier period in film history quite successfully,but it's not enough to impress me personally.Slapstick is much more appealing to me without all the raunchiness.Give me the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy any day of the week.

    Interiewed by Photoplay Magazine in 1980 about their then-new comedy film 'Airplane!', Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cited Woody Allen's 1971 picture 'Bananas' as a major influence on their work. You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( "I smoke them...HE smokes them!", quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President... As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

    Woody Allen is at the top of his wackiness here as a product tester who after being dumped by his activist girl friend goes over to a South American country, joins the rebels and ends up becoming the president. the starting scene which is a live assassination and the end scene which shows the live broadcast of Allen's honeymoon night is side splitting. there is a one minute un-credited cameo by Sylvester Stallone as a tough guy who roughs up Allen in a train. the farcical situations are numerous and the satire in Allen comes to the fore in the marvelous court scene where he is gagged and bound and then goes on to tear the witness apart. this is vintage Allen and his fans would rejoice seeing this early work as the hand of the master satirist is clearly visible.

    When the aliens in Stardust Memories tell the Woody Allen character they liked his early, funnier movies best, this was the sort of thing to which they referred. The premise here is: what would happen if a coffee house philosopher got caught up in a revolution and wound up running a central American republic as its new dictator. As usual, the Woody character (Fielding Mellish) is a windbag who lacks the conviction of his posturing rhetoric and only gets involved in revolutionary politics because of a woman (Louise Lasser). The audience is taken along for a fun satiric ride through the messy tangle of political idealogies as the Woody dilettante soon finds himself among people with guns and convictions. And craziness...

    In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is killed in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos Montalb&aacute;n). In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him. "Bananas" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine "Orgasm"; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Bananas"

    I have started a Woody Allen month and this is my third movie after Annie Hall and Anything Else with Annie Hall as may favorite so far. Those other movies had philosophy of their own with great dialogs and very sophisticated humorous lines. But on this one Woody Allen just falls, acts clumsily etc.which I don't really appreciate for a comedy.Sure the movie as a whole very clever one with its topic and countless needles on the events of its time. Moreover the absurdity of the movie is incredible, the beginning and the ending sequences just blew my head, I just can't imagine the reaction this picture got in 70s.All in all this is not the best comedy ever but it is sure another piece of art from Woody Allen.

    To impress his political activist girlfriend, a product tester leaves New York to lead a revolution in a South American country. In Allen's third directorial effort, the jokes and sight gags come in rapid fire and of course they are hit and miss, mostly the latter. Watching this movie is like listening to a stand-up comic. It's amusing enough while it happens, but is quickly forgotten after it's over. Of course Allen realized this and turned to a more sophisticated brand of comedy after a few years. Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.

    "Bananas" carries the same mix of tender goofiness and self-deprecating romanticism than Woody Allen's first-feature film, confirming what it had already established : the emergence of the most promising comical and comedic talent. I still prefer "Take the Money and Run" because the film was more groundbreaking as the first comedy to exploit the documentary-format, a sub-genre that would be labeled next as 'mockumentary'. However, rediscovering "Bananas" is like an insightful journey into the roots of Allen's talent. Take the title for instance; "Bananas" as a double reference to the slang word meaning 'crazy' and the banana-republics (a derogatory term defining South-American dictatorships) has the same political resonance than the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup". "San Marcos" or "Freedonia"  like "Duck Soup", a fictional setting is the arena allowing to speak the most politically incorrect statements about human nature, and its thirst for power, in the names of such big words as 'freedom' and 'democracy'. But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles. "Annie Hall" would become the consummate -thus the most acclaimed- Woody Allen movie. And in "Bananas", you could tell there were some glimpses of "Annie Hall" through the intellectually engaging romance with Louise Lasser. The Allenian romance would be the director's signature. To close the Woody Allen's influences parenthesis, "Bananas" might borrow many elements from Allen's predecessors, but the film is original and unique in both style and writing. It borrows naturally a lot from "Take the Money and Run", through its clever mix of realistic directing and journalistic format style. The cameos of Howard Cosell commenting on a President's assassination and the aftermath of a honeymoon, with Allen and Lasser's delivery mimicking the way exhausted athletes talk after a match, are ones of the film's highlights. And it's quite an accomplishment to use non-professional actors parodying themselves to such hilarious extremes. This material isn't revolutionary, the parody has already exploited by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, but Woody Allen elevates them to much higher summits by juggling with other forms of humor, without never distracting from the core of the story, and even when it does, it's always redeemed by a hilarious punch-line. Many viewers would look at the film as a series of disjointed sketches, each one working alone but not necessarily making a good film altogether. I would understand the criticism if it wasn't for the pivotal element of the film, which is Fielding Mellish. As the central protagonist, he's both the actor and the victim of all the unfortunate incidents that fill the film with its zany goofiness. He's never too glorious to be a hero, but never passive enough to be a victim. He's just the way he is, and Allen doesn't need many efforts to make us laugh, he's so weird and incomparable that no matter which situation you put him into, it's a laugh-out-loud guarantee. And I can't go on without mentioning one of the funniest break-up scenes ever, when Lasser tries to find out what is missing in her relationship. They enumerate the different aspects of Mellish' personality that could have turned her off, and the list is so long you wonder why he's still trying to find the one reason. Still, the romance is never independent from politics, which are the subject of more mockeries than Mellish' character himself. Most reviewers would try to analyze the film on the basis that it was meant to be a satire and I think this is the best way for disappointment. I love to take the word "Bananas" as the most standard gag of a man slipping on a banana peel, this is what the film is: a big gag. Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles. "Annie Hall" would become the consummate -thus the most acclaimed- Woody Allen movie. And in "Bananas", you could tell there were some glimpses of "Annie Hall" through the intellectually engaging romance with Louise Lasser. The Allenian romance would be the director's signature. To close the Woody Allen's influences parenthesis, "Bananas" might borrow many elements from Allen's predecessors, but the film is original and unique in both style and writing. It borrows naturally a lot from "Take the Money and Run", through its clever mix of realistic directing and journalistic format style. The cameos of Howard Cosell commenting on a President's assassination and the aftermath of a honeymoon, with Allen and Lasser's delivery mimicking the way exhausted athletes talk after a match, are ones of the film's highlights. And it's quite an accomplishment to use non-professional actors parodying themselves to such hilarious extremes. This material isn't revolutionary, the parody has already exploited by Mel Brooks and Monty Python, but Woody Allen elevates them to much higher summits by juggling with other forms of humor, without never distracting from the core of the story, and even when it does, it's always redeemed by a hilarious punch-line. Many viewers would look at the film as a series of disjointed sketches, each one working alone but not necessarily making a good film altogether. I would understand the criticism if it wasn't for the pivotal element of the film, which is Fielding Mellish. As the central protagonist, he's both the actor and the victim of all the unfortunate incidents that fill the film with its zany goofiness. He's never too glorious to be a hero, but never passive enough to be a victim. He's just the way he is, and Allen doesn't need many efforts to make us laugh, he's so weird and incomparable that no matter which situation you put him into, it's a laugh-out-loud guarantee. And I can't go on without mentioning one of the funniest break-up scenes ever, when Lasser tries to find out what is missing in her relationship. They enumerate the different aspects of Mellish' personality that could have turned her off, and the list is so long you wonder why he's still trying to find the one reason. Still, the romance is never independent from politics, which are the subject of more mockeries than Mellish' character himself. Most reviewers would try to analyze the film on the basis that it was meant to be a satire and I think this is the best way for disappointment. I love to take the word "Bananas" as the most standard gag of a man slipping on a banana peel, this is what the film is: a big gag. Belonging to Woody Allen's goofy period, the film is not to be taken seriously. Like in "Duck Soup", it's all about the gags. If one scene puzzles you, wait for the punch line and you're going to get its reason to be. The gags are unequally funny, but as a whole, we spend a great moment watching "Bananas". Last but not least the film is served by a catchy score and a love song signed by Marvin Hamlisch, who'd win an Oscar two years later for "The Way We Were". And this is the way Woody was, not to be taken seriously is one thing, but when it came to comedic film-making, Allen was the most serious talent emerging in the 70's, the rest is history  (PS: the titular quote is from Plato)

    I am not a big fan of Woody Allen.A lot of it has to do with his persistent slams against Christianity,which I don't find funny.This film does little to change my mind,but I will have to give him some credit here.At least he kept the religious slams to a minimum with this film.He took the basic elements of slapstick comedy that we had known throughout the years and incorporated it into a much racier period in film history quite successfully,but it's not enough to impress me personally.Slapstick is much more appealing to me without all the raunchiness.Give me the Marx Brothers or Laurel and Hardy any day of the week.

    Interiewed by Photoplay Magazine in 1980 about their then-new comedy film 'Airplane!', Jim Abrahams, Jerry and David Zucker cited Woody Allen's 1971 picture 'Bananas' as a major influence on their work. You can see why. Several gags, such as the spoof television commercial for 'Old Testament' cigarettes ( "I smoke them...HE smokes them!", quips a priest, glancing upwards ), the honeymoon consummation scene which is shot like a televised boxing match, the trial scene which involves Miss America and J.Edgar Hoover disguised as a black woman, could have fitted into any one of the gang's pictures. 'Bananas' was only Woody's second film as director, the first being the seminal spoof documentary - yes, the genre existed before 'This Is Spinal Tap' - 'Take The Money & Run'. It stars our bespectacled hero as 'Fielding Mellish', a products tester who is incredibly unlucky when it comes to girls. Nobody wants to go out with him. He meets and falls for 'Nancy' ( Louise Lasser, Allen's real-wife wife at the time ), a political activist keen to end American aid to the banana republic of San Marcos in South America. They have had a revolution there, and the country is now being run by a dictator called 'Vargas'. When Nancy breaks off the relationship, Mellish flies to San Marcos to find her, only to get caught up in the counter-revolution, ultimately becoming its new President... As was the case with 'Run', this picture contains all of Allen's usual preoccupations - sex, death, human relationships. The gags come at you like bullets from a Gatling gun, some work better than others. My favourites include Mellish trying to buy a porno magazine, dealing with thugs on a subway train ( one of whom is played by a young Sylvester Stallone ), falling down a manhole as he gets out of his car, hurting his back during training with the rebels and being forced to crouch as he joins the queue for food, President Vargas thinking he has enlisted aid from the C.I.A. when in fact it is a Jewish organisation ( suddenly the streets of San Marcos are teeming with rabbis ), and Nancy telling Mellish that 'someone is missing' from their relationship. He asks what it is, and she does not know. He replies that if she does not know what it is, how does she know its missing? Woody has never made a secret of his love for the Marx Brothers' pictures, and their influence is evident. This hails from what what we might term his 'golden age' when, along with Mel Brooks, he was the best American comedy film maker around. Three films in similar vein followed - 'Everything You Always Wanted To Know About Sex But Were Afraid To Ask' ( 1972 ), 'Sleeper' ( 1973 ), and 'Love & Death' ( 1974 ) - before Allen decided to reinvent himself with 'Annie Hall' ( 1977 ).

    Woody Allen is at the top of his wackiness here as a product tester who after being dumped by his activist girl friend goes over to a South American country, joins the rebels and ends up becoming the president. the starting scene which is a live assassination and the end scene which shows the live broadcast of Allen's honeymoon night is side splitting. there is a one minute un-credited cameo by Sylvester Stallone as a tough guy who roughs up Allen in a train. the farcical situations are numerous and the satire in Allen comes to the fore in the marvelous court scene where he is gagged and bound and then goes on to tear the witness apart. this is vintage Allen and his fans would rejoice seeing this early work as the hand of the master satirist is clearly visible.

    When the aliens in Stardust Memories tell the Woody Allen character they liked his early, funnier movies best, this was the sort of thing to which they referred. The premise here is: what would happen if a coffee house philosopher got caught up in a revolution and wound up running a central American republic as its new dictator. As usual, the Woody character (Fielding Mellish) is a windbag who lacks the conviction of his posturing rhetoric and only gets involved in revolutionary politics because of a woman (Louise Lasser). The audience is taken along for a fun satiric ride through the messy tangle of political idealogies as the Woody dilettante soon finds himself among people with guns and convictions. And craziness...

    In the Republic of San Marcos, in Latin America, the president is killed in a Coup d'&Eacute;tat promoted by General Emilio M. Vargas (Carlos Montalb&aacute;n). In New York, the products tester Fielding Mellish (Woody Allen) meets the political activist Nancy (Louise Lasser) and they have a love affair. Fielding has an unrequited love with Nancy, who believes that he is immature and without leadership. Fielding decides to travel to San Marcos and General Vargas plots a scheme the assassination of Fielding to be supported by the USA against the rebels led by Esposito (Jacobo Morales). However the rebels save Fielding and train him in guerrilla warfare. General Vargas flees to the United States. Esposito deranges with the power and Fielding becomes the President of San Marcos. He wears a long beard and travels to USA seeking financial support to the country and he meets Nancy again, who falls in love with him. "Bananas" is a witty joke with the US- sponsored dictatorships in Latin America in the 60's by Woody Allen. The story has hilarious situations, like when Fielding Mellish is buying the porn magazine "Orgasm"; or with the two subway thugs (one of them the uncredited Sylvester Stallone); or having dinner with the junta; or training with the rebels. My vote is eight. Title (Brazil): "Bananas"

    I have started a Woody Allen month and this is my third movie after Annie Hall and Anything Else with Annie Hall as may favorite so far. Those other movies had philosophy of their own with great dialogs and very sophisticated humorous lines. But on this one Woody Allen just falls, acts clumsily etc.which I don't really appreciate for a comedy.Sure the movie as a whole very clever one with its topic and countless needles on the events of its time. Moreover the absurdity of the movie is incredible, the beginning and the ending sequences just blew my head, I just can't imagine the reaction this picture got in 70s.All in all this is not the best comedy ever but it is sure another piece of art from Woody Allen.

    To impress his political activist girlfriend, a product tester leaves New York to lead a revolution in a South American country. In Allen's third directorial effort, the jokes and sight gags come in rapid fire and of course they are hit and miss, mostly the latter. Watching this movie is like listening to a stand-up comic. It's amusing enough while it happens, but is quickly forgotten after it's over. Of course Allen realized this and turned to a more sophisticated brand of comedy after a few years. Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.

    "Bananas" carries the same mix of tender goofiness and self-deprecating romanticism than Woody Allen's first-feature film, confirming what it had already established : the emergence of the most promising comical and comedic talent. I still prefer "Take the Money and Run" because the film was more groundbreaking as the first comedy to exploit the documentary-format, a sub-genre that would be labeled next as 'mockumentary'. However, rediscovering "Bananas" is like an insightful journey into the roots of Allen's talent. Take the title for instance; "Bananas" as a double reference to the slang word meaning 'crazy' and the banana-republics (a derogatory term defining South-American dictatorships) has the same political resonance than the Marx Brothers' "Duck Soup". "San Marcos" or "Freedonia"  like "Duck Soup", a fictional setting is the arena allowing to speak the most politically incorrect statements about human nature, and its thirst for power, in the names of such big words as 'freedom' and 'democracy'. But like in "Duck Soup", politics are the vehicles for gags, not the opposite. "Bananas" has the texture of a satire, but when you realize that no drop of blood is shed, even during executions, you know the comedy is to be seen in a lighthearted way. Take now the main protagonist, with the perfect name for a neurotic loser: Fielding Mellish. Mellish is a machine-tester for a General Equipment firm. The majority of movie lovers would recognize in his first entrance the clever wink to another comical milestone: Charlie Chaplin, during the famous eating-machine scene in "Modern Times"  and the mayhem caused by the Execusizer (a gym built into office desk) is even funnier because it goes unnoticed by the firm executives. Other bits of silent humor are used in "Bananas", a confrontation with two thugs in the subway (one is played by a young Sylvester Stallone), a training-montage in San Marcos' jungle. The legacy of Chaplin is so present I wondered if the grotesque sight of Allen with a false beard parodying Fidel Castro wasn't a reference to Chaplin as Hynkel  all things being relative, of course. However, Allen never imitates but rather uses his writing talent to plant the seeds of his comical inspiration, that would finally bloom with his first mature comedy : "Love and Death", the film that would reveal another major influence : Ingmar Bergman. Woody Allen would reveal himself as the unlikely center of a wide cinematic universe, reconciling even the most different genres and directing styles.

Lasser, Woody's wife at the time, is pretty good in the kind of role that would go to Diane Keaton and Mia Farrow in later films.

    I suppose this was very funny when it was new. And I do get it, how fresh and new and different this humor was at the time. But this is not that time, and this film has not aged well. All of the funny things that had some (or a lot) of originality back then, have now been done to death. Like the Howard Cosell scenes. I'm sure that was a scream, then, but now it's old hat. I suppose I should judge the film from its own time, but I didn't see it then, I saw it now. Woody Allen's tiresome New York angst shtick has palled over the decades, and that's not new, or fresh, or funny anymore. I would probably suggest taking a pass on this film, unless you have some interest in it as film history. It won't work as comedy.

    Incredibly funny, broad, slapstick political satire as Woody takes over a Latin American country to impress a girl. A few bits feel dated, and it didn''t make me laugh quite as much as 'Take the Money and Run' when I recently re-watched Allen's 'early funny' films, but still has more than it share of great comic moments. The whole lengthy trial sequence is genius worthy of the best of the Marx Brothers or W.C. Fields. (Or, in a slightly more modern context Monty Python). The score bugged me a bit, feeling a bit on-the-nose, and like it was underlining jokes and comic moments too literally. For me, Allen took a major step forward towards finding his voice when he switched from having scores written to using existing tracks.
