 <sinopse>
  Epic tale of three brothers and their father living in the remote wilderness of 1900s USA and how their lives are affected by nature, history, war, and love.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Set in the Rocky Mountains of Montana in the early 1900s, this is a tale of love, betrayal, and brotherhood. After being discharged, Colonel Ludlow decides to raise his three sons in the wilds of Montana, where they can grow up away from the government and society he has learned to despise. The three brothers mature and seem to have an unbreakable bond, until Susanna enters their lives. When Samuel, the youngest of the three, returns from college he brings with him his beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susanna. The eldest son, Alfred, soon finds himself in love with his brother's fianc&eacute;e, and things get worse when he discovers a growing passion between Susanna and Tristan. Colonel Ludlow's favorite son, Tristan is willful and as wild as the mountains. As the brothers set out to fight a war in Europe, suspicion and jealousy threatens to tear apart their once indestructible bond.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward.

And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe.

The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt.

But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.

    Anthony Hopkins does the repressed Englishman (and "American") so well that I find him a pleasure to watch. I have seen 'Remains of The Day' several times and find it absolutely riveting. Although set in the USA I was hoping for something similar from 'Legends'. But, Oh-dear. I knew there was trouble from the outset. All those violins going full blast - this was going to be an emotional workout. But not in the understated minutely-observed Merchant Ivory style. Nope; this was Hollywood. Emotions must be in-yer-face. And so it went. Towering chords of high-string excess, bursting over your eardrums like waves on a flat beach. Endless backdrops of rugged American wilderness - seemingly always filmed in a mellow sunlit evening, a solid all-American family of 3 strapping sons & their father, all pitted against the changing times and star-crossed destiny. And if that were not enough; an American-Indian voice-over, righteously moralising about life and family. After you with the peace-pipe. But its early 20th century and the lads fancy a bit of adventure in it'll-all-be-over-by-Christmass's famous WW1 mudfest. You know what's coming; high-spirits turned to disillusionment. Adventure dissolved in slaughter. The recreation of WW1 conflict was the most unresearched piece of twaddle I've even seen. Its directors had evidently never explored the effects of mustard gas. The last episode of 'Blackadder Goes Forth' was streets ahead of this in accuracy, poignancy and hilarious too. After watching two Germans busily setting-up a machine gun to shoot just one bloke (a brother) trapped on barbed wire, instead of just popping him with a rifle, whilst another brother went dashing about the battlefield, ranting like a maniac, but apparently immune to gunfire - I gave it up. The photography of the great American outdoors was splendid. But the rest? Frankly: garbage. Dunno how it ended, couldn't care less.

    The sweeping, melodramatic saga of three brothers, their powerful father, and a beautiful woman, the popular period drama Legends of the Fall presents a romanticized view of rugged masculinity against lush Montana scenery. Based on a novel by Jim Harrison, the film covers decades in the lives of Alfred, Tristan, and Samuel Ludlow, the sons of retired military man William Ludlow. Legends of the Fall is an epic film based on the 1979 novella of the same title by Jim Harrison.It stars Brad Pitt, Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn together with Julia Ormond,Henry Thomas,and Karina Lombard.The movie was directed by Edward Zwick. Raised by the unorthodox Ludlow after the departure of their mother, the boys grow up close, sharing an appreciation of the land and a pioneering spirit. The family becomes divided, however, when young Sam enlists in World War I over his father's objections, and his brothers follow suit to protect him. Despite these efforts, Sam dies in battle, leaving Alfred and Tristan to return home and deal with the lingering torment. Further complicating matters is the presence of Sam's beautiful fianc&eacute;e, Susannah. After Sam's death, she attracts the romantic attention of both the responsible Alfred and the brooding Tristan, a conflict that threatens to drive the brothers apart. Aspiring to epic status, the film utilizes period detail and attractive landscapes as a backdrop for tragic, doomed romance. This is a magnificent melodrama that has a combination of emotion and grand historical scale similar to the James Dean 1956 classic,The Giant.Aside from that,it has brilliant performances from its cast especially Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins.Although it lacks an emotional punch to become a compelling and absorbing film,it is far from being a classic but it still is an above average film.

    According to the ancient lore of Native Americans, there is a story within each of us; the story of a life often guided by some inner voice, which some hear with great clearness. Some live by what they hear-- and such people become crazy. They become legend. And so it was destined to be for a young man named Tristan Ludlow, who was born toward the end of the Nineteenth Century and grew up in the wide open spaces of Montana, where his father, Colonel William Ludlow, had taken his family to escape the imperfections of a society ruled by a government he could no longer respect. The background is the west of America in 1910. We could see how the people live in the west, their relation with American Indian, how they hunt the wild game. Tristan is a typical western hero and his whole life is full of passion and romantic. His soul connects with a bear, in an old proverb that everyone has a beast in their soul. Tristan's bear is always awake that is the misfortune of his family and himself. Hopkins anchors the film with a brilliantly understated performance, creating a three-dimensional character who personifies the very iconoclastic ideals and principles he espouses. And Pitt gives one of the best performances of his career as Tristan; watching him, you feel that restlessness and conflict raging within his soul, and you can sense his passion as he seeks his direction in life. Quinn is also extremely effective as Alfred, the older brother, delivering an emotional and convincing performance, as does Julia Ormond, as Susannah, a young woman conflicted inside as she tries to sort out her feelings for the Ludlow brothers. Zwick knew exactly what he needed from his actors to tell the story he wanted to tell, and he managed to get it all, from the principals to the least of the supporting players; and it's all there on the screen-- the passion, the intensity, the love and the care. It's quite simply a beautiful piece of filmmaking by all concerned.

    This movie is not, as advertised on the video cover, one of the best movies released. There are far better ones out there. Legend of the Fall is not a bad movie though; in fact it is quite a good and well constructed movie. There is a lot in this movie if one looks closely, the major theme being a criticism on civilisation. The movie is set on a ranch in Dakota and goes from the late 1800's to the mid 1920's and chronicles the life of three brothers: Samuel, Tristan, and Matthew. These three brothers symbolise three things: Samuel is naivety; Tristan is the wild; and Matthew is the civilised. Samuel's naivety kills him pretty quickly when World War I breaks outs. Matthew, an officer, is discharged after an injury, while Tristan goes wild after his brother's death and is discharged soon after. This aspect of the movie is very anti-war; the brothers leave seeking glory, all except Tristan who goes to look after his brothers, but all return in an unglorious manner. Matthew is wounded, Tristan is wild, Samuel is dead. There is a very strong animosity towards war in this movie, especially from the boys' father, Colonel Ludlow. Right at the opening he throws his sword down and walks away from an Indian Village. He has seen the truth of war and is very much against it and the government after this. The Colonel, as well as being against war and the government, has come to an understanding that the Indians are real suffering people and becomes a sympathiser. The ranch is on the border of civilisation and a number of times people come and go from the ranch and there is a symbolisation with the way that they leave. The mother, Isabella, is the first to leave and she leaves in a carriage, her destination is the cities of the east. When Samuel returns with his fianc&eacute; Suzanna, they come in by car. When the brothers leave to war they leave on horseback, and they return on horseback. When Tristan leaves to travel the world, he leaves on horseback. It seems that the horse symbolises travelling into the wild and the unknown. Even though the war is in Europe, the war is uncivilised, as Colonel Ludlow says, and is wild. The authorities arrive at the ranch in two ways, first they come on horseback, later they come by car and this seems to be merging the civilised with the uncivilised. As the movie moves on, we begin to see that what we once considered to be civilsed is really not. There is a large distinction at the beginning, but as we see with Europe, the centre of civilisation, plunging into war, so we see urban United States also plunging into a state of barbarism. This comes out with the prohibition act and how the authorities begin to use standover tactics to intimidate Tristan. When he is arrested, it is not for smuggling, rather it is for beating up a police officer. The corruption of the government is clearly seen in the congressman's party where the upperclass are drinking champagne even though alcohol is illegal. The point of Legend of the Fall is that there is no such thing as civilisation. Though we sit on the borderlands, everywhere we go is wilderness, even in the heart of urban America. The beast that is with Tristan is in all others, it is only that they have learnt to control that beast. The only truly civilised person in the movie is the Indian storyteller who never speaks a word of English (the narrative has been translated, the Indian is narrating it in his own language). He refuses to sink so low.

    Like the instincts of a sad puppy dog, "Legends of the Fall" is likely enough to manipulate the audience by staring at you in the eyes, jump at you and salivate at you with their big red tongues. It's an unsettling story that's way too oratorical for my tastes and seems more dependent on style over substance, but for some reason I can't explain, it still lured me because it was very entertaining. I could rattle on for hours of all the flaws in this movie, and yet after all the ranting I still find something that made this movie at least worthwhile. And the main element that made this film worthy to view comes in one person and his name's Brad Pitt. Just Pitt's performance alone eradicates all the flaws that have materialized in the entire movie alone. Situated in the great state of Montana in the early 20th century, it tells the tale of the Ludlow family as Col. William Ludlow (Anthony Hopkins) decides to resign from military life after getting frustrated over the government's neglecting the policies over Native People. The story begins in the year 1914 when the youngest of the three Ludlow brothers Samuel (Henry Thomas) introduces his family towards his new fianc&eacute;e, Susannah (Julia Ormond). But her welcoming has quite a chain reaction because the oldest Ludlow brother Alfred (Aidan Quinn) is also smitten by her presence, but she has her eyes set on the middle son, Tristan (Brad Pitt). Soon the three brothers follow their father's legacy and go off to fight in the First World War. Sadly one of the brothers gets killed and a love triangle ensues between the surviving two brothers and leaving poor Susannah in the middle. For the opening half hour I actually was glued to the seat. At first I was given the impression that this movie was going to be a good, wholesome family drama with tons of positive issues going for it. All the performances were quite brilliant and the exchange in dialogues by the Ludlow Brothers felt natural like they really were brothers and the pacing was perfect in a way that it was neither rushed or lagging, but right in the middle. But once the brothers journey off to Europe, the movie starts to fall apart and never has time to recover. One minute I'm enjoying this confidently made movie and then next thing you know it falls off the tracks and like a bumpy ride you feel yourself relived that it's finally over. What transpires in this rubble is Tristan travelling the globe with a guilty conscious while he's selling alcohol to the Irish and we're treated to three funerals. And by making the story feel like a Native American legend, we see Tristan mysteriously befriending a bear, which not only looks comical, but contrived. Though the script and the performances may have looked awkward, I would have to say that the technical features. In 1989, director Edward Zwick created a brilliant atmosphere when he made "Glory" and he follows this flow with him in "Legends of the Fall". The war scenes look identical to "Glory" with only contrasting uniforms. John Toll's photography located in Alberta and British Columbia (passing off as Montana) is picturesque and that one scene where Susannah is reading a note as she walks through the coniferous trees was absolutely stunning. The musical score by James Horner is as smooth to the ears that you might hum to easily. As the story seems to progressively lack, the sights and sounds of "Legends of the Fall" get better through time. In spite of all that the best casting choice Zwick provides for us is the performance of Brad Pitt. From the early start, Pitt grabs our attention Sure he has to carry himself through the bloated melodramatic moments, but it's that intensity that plays a pivotal part in this role and is voided from being overdone and his tearful moments don't look superficial like crocodile tears that some of the male performers provide. The letdown here is that Pitt fades away from the narrative in substantial periods of time as the other Ludlow brothers and Susannah become the central characters. Which is too bad because the characters lack the panache to keep the audience from drifting off. The last fifteen minutes wraps up quite nicely with a retribution message similar to that in "The Godfather", but it hits the spot in this movie. All I can say now is that "Legends of the Fall" lacks originality and at times becomes a bit awkward. However, if you could put a mega-star in a Western film, it can only come across as satisfying enough to just be almost like a guilty pleasure.

    Legends of the Fall is a sweeping romantic western that is one to remember for the ages. I love when they make these kind of films because they bring out the inner western solitude from me. This film reminded me deeply of Dance With Wolves which of course is better, but this is still a strong-willed film. This film is not only a showcase of great acting, but it features sweeping, gorgeous cinematography and just stunning landscape shots which are always necessary in movies like this. Edward Zwick's film is about the bond of three brothers and their powerful father who is a retired colonel. This film follows the storyline of the kids growing up to the time of World War One and Prohibition. As I said before, this film is a showcase for acting. It features top-notch performances from everyone in the film but Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins carry the film. Hopkins has one of his better roles as the retired colonel and he is just so good. Brad Pitt proves here why he has the makings of being a star. He had a few emotional scenes where he struggled to find his inner self. Overall, this is a glorious, sweeping epic that does not take itself too seriously. It has a few central themes about family and friendship and this movie does a good job on getting those points across. This film may not have much action, but the western aspect is done well as that is why I'm reminded of Dance with Wolves. I rate this film 9/10.

    There's a lot about this movie, that obviously would get you involved, especially, if you're a woman. I wouldn't argue about this movie with a woman, that is for granted. But if you really open your eyes, the central plot is about a selfish guy who doesn't care enough about his father (and the younger brother whom the movie claims he loves more than his life), and others who have been around him all his life. And about a Susannah, who just can't seem to "get enough", if you know what I mean, even after she's long married to the elder brother. While I've loved almost all of the drama movies out there that are rated good by the average IMDb user, I felt this one was a rotten apple. Most of what the movie highlights as subtle emotions felt cheap to me, as Tristian's selfishness for one, and Susannah's questionable frailty in moral character, for another. While a movie doesn't have to be true to socially/morally accepted values, I felt that the movie was trying to portray the ugly sides of these two characters in good light, which is where it failed for me, or rather should I say, irritating. It was like "these two need a good lesson of the whip". And yes, the war scenes left a lot to beg for.

    I love the fact that because they lived with an American Indian they lived forever. The whole film seems really spiritual. Hopkins, by my calculations, is about 250yo. Although he does actually grow old. The others though, don't Other than a bit of hair growth. Saying all that. I love that bear. He's brilliant, a real talent. Old timers are hilarious in this. Especially the bear. Where did you get him from? I can't believe I have never seen him before. He must come from a really good drama school in either London or New York. Anyway, highly recommend 10/10. One of the best bear films I have seen. And, mind you, I have seen a few. Better than The Note Book.

    It took me a while before I finally sat down to watch this movie. Something just told me that this was just another drama with few surprises and a sad ending. Holly sh!t I was mistaken. Legends of the fall is without a doubt, one of the best movies I have ever seen. The directing, scenery and movie plot is absolutely amazing. The acting in this movie is terrific. Aidan Quinn, Julia Armond and Henry Thomas is brilliant in their supporting roles. I think Anthony Hopkins performance in this movie is absolutely breathtaking, I liked him before I saw this movie, and afterwards, liking became loving. And last but not least, Brad Pitt, delivers as he always does. This was maybe the best performance I have seen him do, and if you are a Brad Pitt fan, and have seen some of his movies, you know that it saying a lot. I won't say anything about the movie plot, because I am afraid to ruin just a little part of the feeling I got when I saw this. But Legends of the fall is excellent. I cried three or four times during this movie, and I laughed at myself because that is something that I never do. I recommend that you watch this and I can (almost) guarantee that you are going to enjoy it. And even tough the duration time of this movie is over two hours, I wasn't bored, not even for a second.

    ATTENTION: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! This is one of those movies that aim at a specific target audience. Only women really love this movie because it's about love and tragedy and what not. But seriously this movie is completely pointless. I mean half of the characters die for no apparent reason. The problems that the characters have they themselves create. And the thing that I hated about this movie is that I predicted more than half of the events in it. The moment the three brothers went to war I knew that the youngest would get killed. OK that wasn't too hard to guess. But it wasn't just that. When Tristan left and Susannah told him she'd wait for him forever I just knew that she'd wait like a year tops and then run after Alfred. I predicted that Tristan would marry the young Indian girl, I predicted that she'd get killed. But when it came to the final scene where the Mafia and the Sheriff came to kill Tristan and when after two of the guys were shot and a bullet flew in out of nowhere and shot the Sheriff I was like "ok, if this is Alfred that shot that last one then this is definitely the lamest movie I've ever seen". And what do you know, it was Alfred. But I still give this movie a 3 instead of a 1 because I can't say that it was completely uninteresting. There were some exciting moments however there were very few of them. And the only reason that this movie has such a high rating is because chicks are suckers for this kind of movies.
