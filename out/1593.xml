    A fairly mediocre film with three wasted talents. That's wasted as in not used to their full potentials, not what you might think. This movie could have been so much more, but seemed to just "get-by". Neil is wooden, really wooden, he makes an old growth forest look like it's made of PVC and polycarbonates. Clarke is his usual self but doesn't have much to work with and Zoe does a good job. Especially given that she got her assets out in a scene. Aside from that it feels dated, and boring. The "ethnic" Australian angle wasn't used to it's best potential. Although other reviewers comment on the "nastier" aspects of this movie it's really very tame and the nastiest thing about it is the horrible 80's leather pants. Straight to DVD stuff.

    A funny, dark comedy about a life changing episode of a 34 year old single man. Coming from a posh upbringing but a complete slacker, or so you are lead to believe. The confused man seems to aspire to more and meets a young (19) bar girl at his work where he has just become the struggling head cook. The clue to the twist is in the title, from being a romantic comedy with lovely little moments that echo your own ways in the early stages of dating. It then spins on it's head as an offbeat thriller, still just as funny though. The darker side to the film gives it's funniest moments, notably after paralysing his mother, he then controls her wheelchair with a remote control to get about. Also his best friend deserves a mention, great deadpan calmness, especially when burying the body. Maybe it is a little long for the story at hand but still well worth watching even if romance or thrillers aren't your thing as it has many other layers.

    In Death in Brunswick Sam Neill plays a cook who's having a particularly bad week - his mother's moved in for a visit, he's got on the wrong side of his new boss's psychotic minder and he accidentally kills his kitchen helper. What may look on the surface to be another disposing of the body comedy (just what the world needs) in fact goes off in various weird and sometimes wonderful directions, constantly catching you off guard. Certainly tasteless (the cockroach anchovies on a pizza are one of the minor outrages) but never disgusting, although it's not laugh-a-minute it is very funny in its details and it works because the characters are there. With Neil and John Clarke's long-suffering best friend a great double-act, it's definitely a diamond in the rough.

    This all Australian production is both original and darkly funny. Sam Neill plays a dopey cook who, after meeting an attractive night-club waitress, has an incredible run of bad luck. Zoe Carides is very sexy as Neill's nineteen year old love, while John Clarke provides great support as his best friend Dave. "Death in Brunswick" is a fine debut from writer-director John Ruane (co-written with Boyd Oxley), as he brings us many moments of hilarity. Last but not least, Sam Neill himself makes a likable, if very non-directional hero, as Carl Fitzgerald. Fantastic to see home grown humour done as well as this. Friday, January 17, 1992 - Video

    Great film. I worked with John a few years back on a short film that never got made. We had a great time and I really wish my movie went further. He was a great director to work with, had some odd ideas, but hey, that's awesome, and Death in Brunswick was a great Australian film. I reckon you , JOHN, should go all out and make that ideal dream film. The one with all your crazy, whacked out ideas. Like the one with the kids that buried their principle under the oval. That was seriously cool. Cant wait to see some more Ruane films. Hope you're still at it John. You kicked butt back then and I'm sure you still can. Well I'm running out of lines cause this thing says I need ten lines to submit it. OK I think that's enough. TySe

    Dave is the hero of the movie. &iquest;Who would squash the head of a dead and rotting body just to make a favor to his/her friend? I would not have the guts. The cemetery scenes are both absolute hilarious and insane: 2 friends dragging a dead and farting body into an open grave to create the perfect crime. The Police haven't found the corpse yet. They will never do. And Dave's family complaining because he stinks death Priceless. Cookie is a loser but he has &iquest;some sex appeal maybe? He also creates all the trouble. I think that Cookie has suffered a lobotomy, and Dave helps him to overcome the problem. You would love these guys. Brunswick is a very horrible place. I visited this suburb in Melbourne and the only missing thing is the Adam's family house. 9/10.

    ...now that's rich!! THAT would have to be the best joke I have heard in years. Sighting the words "USA" & "Comedy" together in reference to a film or television show guides me to steer way clear - WARNING!!! OBVIOUS, UNSUBTLE GARBAGE MASQUERADING AS HUMOUR IS NIGH!!! When they published the dictionary in the States I'm sure they MUST have excluded words such as "irony" and "satire". For those of you who wonder how they tempted Sam Neill to be in such a small film - he's a good mate of John Clarke (they are partners in a film production company - he also appeared in one episode of The Games). He serves our film industry well. Between 2000 & 2005 he made approx 20 films - half of those were made for the local film industry (including one in New Zealand). Compare that to Nicole Kidman - 17 films in the same period and only 2 for the local film industry (and squeezing Moulin Rouge into that is pushing it - at least it used local crew & extras).

    Death in Brunswick is a smashing wee film. It comes from that venerable antipodean tradition of the "cooky" movie - see: almost anything by Baz Luhrmann or films like The Team, Goodbye Pork Pie, Don's Party, Cars that ate Paris etc etc. Off beat doesn't describe this kind of film - so talk about refreshing. Just when you think the narrative is heading along in a "I-sort-of-get-this" direction - some new character or plot device comes up and wryly calls you over and says: nah that would be too boring. Fear not though this isn't laboured zaniness or posturing surreality - this is clever, clever, clever stuff - character driven, funny as...and basically something to get you thinking. And get this: someone actually sat in a room somewhere and thought: "Right we'll get that handsome Sam Neill guy and make him a play a weedy loser who lives with his mum." ???Only in Oz. No wonder the man himself ranks this gem among his favourite movies.

    From the moment the film opens, depicting aluminium cans rolling ceaselessly (and noisily) in the wind, along with the elderly Greek ladies putting this year's Christmas trees into the wrecked Austin 1800 (stuffed next to previous year's Christmas trees), you know that this film is going to be a little different. Melbourne, one of the most multi-cultural metropolis's in the world (should that be metropoli?) is the setting for this rather dark comedy drama. Carl, an unemployed and very much down on his luck chef, gets a job at a less than reputable nightclub in the Melbourne suburb of Brunswick. He falls in love with one of the Greek barmaids, much to the consternation of the owner of the bar who has been betrothed to the barmaid. Not helping matters much is a Turkish kitchen hand, who appears to want to spend more time trading in stolen goods and drugs than actually working as a kitchen hand. When matters escalate out of hand, Carl needs the specialist help that only his friend, Dave can provide. If it can be said that a good friend will help you move (house), it's fair to say that only a true friend will help you move - a body, and as a gravedigger at the local cemetery Dave is in the ideal position to help "dispose" of one of Carl's kitchen disasters. Along the way, Dave is pestered by his Feminist-rights movement wife who spends most of her on-screen time berating Dave for his pathetic life, while Carl spends his time being roughed up by the nightclub bouncer, roughed up by a Turkish crime syndicate, or, more worryingly, being berated and belittled by his mother. A truly enjoyable Australian film from the early 1990's, though apparently not available in Australia - I had to get my copy from the UK, though fortunately the UK release is region free.

    Funny how two Kiwis (John Clarke & Sam Neill) have made one of the best and most keenly observed films ever made about the inner suburbs of Melbourne and sad how the only reviewers who couldn't appreciate its humour came from the southern states of the USA. Perhaps the humour came out of references that were a little too specific for people who haven't experienced post second war Melbourne and the effect that the large influx of southern European migrants had on both the city and the migrants themselves over the second half of the twentieth century. John Clarke, who another reviewer rightly said could be funny reading a phone book, steals the movie as the laconic friend of Sam Neill, the weak but likable hero of the story. Clarke played a significant part in the writing of the movie, which has a much lighter touch than the book upon which it its based, and his character gets many of the best lines. Sam Neill is terrific as the hapless hero of the piece, Ms Carides has an appeal that no "thirty something" male could resist, and the supporting characters including "Cookie's" domineering mother, Sophies' fearsome father, Clarke's no-nonsense wife, the club's sleazy owner and his dopey flunkies, and the drug dealing Turk and his associates are all just flawless. There may be parts of the world that contain people sufficiently insular to not appreciate this movie's humour or the way it shows a weak man dealing with and coming to terms with the forces that have oppressed him and one can but feel sorry for them. For the rest of us its a both a movie to bring a wry smile to our faces and a warning against eating crunchy pizzas.
