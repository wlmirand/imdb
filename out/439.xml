    (Plot) An old mirror winds up being bought by a photographer, and it ends up causing a whole lot of problems. Is the Mirror possessing some sort of evil? Of course Sherlock! I had one thought that kept recurring through my mind as I was watching this. How did this DTV piece of junk managed to assemble such a great cast? Were they in need of work that badly? David Naughton (who has a thankless role) Julia Nickson (of Rambo II fame) Richard Roundtree, Lin Shaye, Robert Rusler, and Terry O'Quinn (Stepfather I & II) You would think it would be better off served for a film worthy of their talents My problem with this movie is the same problem I have with a lot of the Amityville movies. They stay near trouble especially in Julia Nickson's case. The way her character is written made my head spin. It also lacks suspense or even the slightest amounts of entertainment. I enjoy low budget movies when they are fun, but this is derived of fun completely and it just gets increasingly sillier throughout the film Final Thoughts: It's a DTV sequel to a movie that shouldn't have spawned so many sequels to begin with, but it sure beats the heck out of watching this movie. Stay away 2/10

    At the rate these movies are rummaging through the artifacts from the Amityville house it won't be long before they get down to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth instalment. A homeless man hands the mirror over to artist Ross Partridge and his huge hair, which leads to strange visions, and unpleasant revelations about his past, and some truly ropey performances. This is a mundane horror film that plods along at a dull pace, leaving us waiting for an atmospheric build-up that never comes as the movie instead offers a variety of supposedly spooky events that lead clumsily to a silly finale. Bland and lifeless, a long way from the genuinely unsettling original.

    Mirror Mirror On The Wall: Who Is The Worst Amityville Of Them All Oh the horror! The streak of rotten "Amityville Horror" sequels continues in "Amityville: A New Generation." In the direct-to-video affair, an up-and-coming photographer (Ross Partridge, whose credentials include (1) episode of "In Living Color" as well as playing "Businessman" in the "Prom Night" remake) brings a haunted mirror back to his hip and happening pad. It's not long before the mirror starts distorting reality, shedding some light on the wannabe-artist's past as well as threatening his circle of friends which includes Shaft and Asian-Shannon Doherty in its ranks. Yet another "Amityville" flick where the "Horror" happens outside of the iconic house from the Margot Kidder/James Brolin original, it's no surprise to find "A New Generation" deviating even further from the original formula than before. Not that twisting the formula is such a bad thing -- it sort of worked in "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (sort of) -- but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. For those keeping score, "Amityville: A New Generation" is the seventh installment in the shockingly long-winded and consistently mediocre "Amityville Horror" franchise. It's to be expected that the film isn't exactly top-notch material, but even judging it as a b-movie doesn't do it justice. The plot, if you can call it that, is really just an excuse for the presence of some admittedly cool paintings and softcore nudity (its only redeeming features, really). The horror in this "Amityville Horror" is in its banality. There is simply no tension to be found, and the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. Add this to the fact that hardly anybody in the film (save for Roundtree and Terry O'Quinn, cashing a check in an otherwise thankless role) can act to save their lives, and you have one very tepid experience. Even those who lapped up the schlock served up in the silly movie-of-the-week "Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes" or even the aforementioned 1992 affair will be hard-pressed to find anything redeeming about "A New Generation." To be quite frank, it's a chore to sit through and even when the film tries to twist things in an effort to re-connect itself to its roots, it just doesn't work. Whatever thrills were to be had with this premise were squeezed out by the anemic sequels that came before. Even if you enjoy cinematic junk food like this, approach with caution. This is not only the "Amityville" franchise at its worst, but also bottom-of-the-barrel even as far as '90s horror and DTV fare go.

    The plot A man in talking to a trap, who end up giving him this mirror, this time is mirror that has the evil force in it. This guy then gives the mirror to the next door neighbours and soon anyone who look into the mirror will die. It was good idea but they could have done so much more thing with it and better, this is a stand alone movie so it not connected to any of the other in series, saying that this is third stand alone movie in the series The acting in this movie was not that bad but the movie it self was way to predicable and can be really, really boring at time, i wish there was a lot more gore then there was, it did enjoy one or two so what gory scene that had in this movie, which really well shot. This is the weakest of them of all, it not the worse one in the series as The Amityville Curse is still the worse of the series, this movie in the second worse but still watchable unlike The Amityville Curse. I going to give this movie 3 out of 10

    'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood. This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*. There's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? Which is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen. The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all. 'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'The Possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

    Oh dear. This sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville home. The mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes(Ross Partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as Keyes' painter pal Suki, portrayed by Julia Nickson-Soul)where he lives when they look into it. Soon Keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him. Pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as David Naughton(American Werewolf in London)as the proprietor of the loft with which Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held Keyes' father) soon to be closed down. Rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supportive girlfriend, Barbara Howard(Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter)as Naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler(A Nightmare on Elm Street 2:Freddy's Revenge)as a rejected lover(..of Nickson-Soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal. This film is a poor special effects movie merely using the Amityville title as a cash-in. The franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. The cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. All's not lost, you get to see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE:A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! Coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.

    After 'Amityville 1992: It's About Time' breathed some much needed life into this dying franchise it was no surprise that another sequel was on the way. A year later the writers of the previous film produced this installment, which like it's predecessor and 1989s 'Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes' was inspired by John G. Jone's book 'Amityville: The Evil Escapes' in that it involves a possessed object from the infamous Long Island house. But after such a winner could they really hit again? In this case they did for the most part. Won't go down as one of the best horror sequels in history, but for a seventh film in a series that went directly to video it's a heck of a lot better and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pros: Well-written. Nice work from the cast. Daniel Licht who scored the previous sequel returns with a very different, but equally memorable and even beautiful score. Some decent supernatural deaths. Moves at kind of a slow, but steady pace. Some respectable twists and turns. One really creepy chase sequence involving a demon. A pretty powerful ending. Cons: Mediocre direction. Not really very scary. Some cheap and unscary looking monster make-up. Final thoughts: Sure none of these sequels to the original will be remembered for being great, but you could find ones that are far more unwatchable and that make you feel bad for those involved. All things considered, 'A New Generation' is an above average continuation of the legacy that is Amityville. My rating: 3.5/5

    Struggling artist Keyes Terry, (Ross Partridge) wife Llanie, (Lala Sloatman) and friend Suki, (Julia Nickson-Soul) try to make it with an art show, and manage to take a mystical mirror home. The rest of their friends, Dick, (David Naughton) and Janet Cutler, (Barbara Howard) think it's a useless purchase until a series of accidents plague them and their friends. As the strange occurrences begin to mount, Keyes begins to suspect that the mirror might be responsible. Doing a little digging into it's past, he discovers a startling secret that puts him and his loved ones in grave danger. Really only guilty of being a rather boring film with no real action at all, and it does have enough other moments to really give fans of the series a couple of rather interesting scenes. Take a shot on it, there's worse films out there than this one. Rated R for Violence, Brief Nudity and Profanity.

    Not a good one. -Not at all. This installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the Amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of Amityville itself. It's basically nothing. My bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... Thankfully, it doesn't kill or ruin the series, but it just has no effect on the series at all. I'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".

    The short synopsis of "Amityville:A New Generation" goes like that:a young photographer Terry Keyes receives a mirror as a gift and sees in its reflection a link to murders committed in Amityville decades before.And slowly the artists loft he shares with friends Suki,Dick and Pauli is turned into a living chamber of horrors,as they too fall prey to the dark seductive powers of the mirror."Amityville:A New Generation" is an average horror flick at its best.There is a little bit of suspense and the characters are surprisingly likable,but the plot is slow-moving and the finale is laughable.I'm not an enthusiast of "Amityville" series,however this seventh installment is actually passable,if you are in the right mood.6 out of 10.

    (Plot) An old mirror winds up being bought by a photographer, and it ends up causing a whole lot of problems. Is the Mirror possessing some sort of evil? Of course Sherlock! I had one thought that kept recurring through my mind as I was watching this. How did this DTV piece of junk managed to assemble such a great cast? Were they in need of work that badly? David Naughton (who has a thankless role) Julia Nickson (of Rambo II fame) Richard Roundtree, Lin Shaye, Robert Rusler, and Terry O'Quinn (Stepfather I & II) You would think it would be better off served for a film worthy of their talents My problem with this movie is the same problem I have with a lot of the Amityville movies. They stay near trouble especially in Julia Nickson's case. The way her character is written made my head spin. It also lacks suspense or even the slightest amounts of entertainment. I enjoy low budget movies when they are fun, but this is derived of fun completely and it just gets increasingly sillier throughout the film Final Thoughts: It's a DTV sequel to a movie that shouldn't have spawned so many sequels to begin with, but it sure beats the heck out of watching this movie. Stay away 2/10

    Mirror Mirror On The Wall: Who Is The Worst Amityville Of Them All Oh the horror! The streak of rotten "Amityville Horror" sequels continues in "Amityville: A New Generation." In the direct-to-video affair, an up-and-coming photographer (Ross Partridge, whose credentials include (1) episode of "In Living Color" as well as playing "Businessman" in the "Prom Night" remake) brings a haunted mirror back to his hip and happening pad. It's not long before the mirror starts distorting reality, shedding some light on the wannabe-artist's past as well as threatening his circle of friends which includes Shaft and Asian-Shannon Doherty in its ranks. Yet another "Amityville" flick where the "Horror" happens outside of the iconic house from the Margot Kidder/James Brolin original, it's no surprise to find "A New Generation" deviating even further from the original formula than before. Not that twisting the formula is such a bad thing -- it sort of worked in "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (sort of) -- but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. For those keeping score, "Amityville: A New Generation" is the seventh installment in the shockingly long-winded and consistently mediocre "Amityville Horror" franchise. It's to be expected that the film isn't exactly top-notch material, but even judging it as a b-movie doesn't do it justice.

    'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood. This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*. There's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? Which is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen. The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all. 'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'The Possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

    Oh dear. This sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville home. The mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes(Ross Partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as Keyes' painter pal Suki, portrayed by Julia Nickson-Soul)where he lives when they look into it. Soon Keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him. Pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as David Naughton(American Werewolf in London)as the proprietor of the loft with which Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held Keyes' father) soon to be closed down. Rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supportive girlfriend, Barbara Howard(Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter)as Naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler(A Nightmare on Elm Street 2:Freddy's Revenge)as a rejected lover(..of Nickson-Soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal. This film is a poor special effects movie merely using the Amityville title as a cash-in. The franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. The cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. All's not lost, you get to see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE:A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! Coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.

    After 'Amityville 1992: It's About Time' breathed some much needed life into this dying franchise it was no surprise that another sequel was on the way. A year later the writers of the previous film produced this installment, which like it's predecessor and 1989s 'Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes' was inspired by John G. Jone's book 'Amityville: The Evil Escapes' in that it involves a possessed object from the infamous Long Island house. But after such a winner could they really hit again? In this case they did for the most part. Won't go down as one of the best horror sequels in history, but for a seventh film in a series that went directly to video it's a heck of a lot better and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pros: Well-written. Nice work from the cast. Daniel Licht who scored the previous sequel returns with a very different, but equally memorable and even beautiful score. Some decent supernatural deaths. Moves at kind of a slow, but steady pace. Some respectable twists and turns. One really creepy chase sequence involving a demon. A pretty powerful ending. Cons: Mediocre direction. Not really very scary. Some cheap and unscary looking monster make-up. Final thoughts: Sure none of these sequels to the original will be remembered for being great, but you could find ones that are far more unwatchable and that make you feel bad for those involved. All things considered, 'A New Generation' is an above average continuation of the legacy that is Amityville. My rating: 3.5/5

    Struggling artist Keyes Terry, (Ross Partridge) wife Llanie, (Lala Sloatman) and friend Suki, (Julia Nickson-Soul) try to make it with an art show, and manage to take a mystical mirror home. The rest of their friends, Dick, (David Naughton) and Janet Cutler, (Barbara Howard) think it's a useless purchase until a series of accidents plague them and their friends. As the strange occurrences begin to mount, Keyes begins to suspect that the mirror might be responsible. Doing a little digging into it's past, he discovers a startling secret that puts him and his loved ones in grave danger. Really only guilty of being a rather boring film with no real action at all, and it does have enough other moments to really give fans of the series a couple of rather interesting scenes. Take a shot on it, there's worse films out there than this one. Rated R for Violence, Brief Nudity and Profanity.

    Not a good one. -Not at all. This installment revolves around a descent of the original murderer inside the Amityville home who must face his past to rid himself of the nightmarish terror of Amityville itself. It's basically nothing. My bet is that this film was made for some extra fast-cash to buy a boat or something... because this one's just ridiculous... Thankfully, it doesn't kill or ruin the series, but it just has no effect on the series at all. I'd have to say that just the fact that it is constantly referenced to the old, infamous house is probably the only thing that makes this one slightly more bearable than "The Amityville Curse".

    The short synopsis of "Amityville:A New Generation" goes like that:a young photographer Terry Keyes receives a mirror as a gift and sees in its reflection a link to murders committed in Amityville decades before.And slowly the artists loft he shares with friends Suki,Dick and Pauli is turned into a living chamber of horrors,as they too fall prey to the dark seductive powers of the mirror."Amityville:A New Generation" is an average horror flick at its best.There is a little bit of suspense and the characters are surprisingly likable,but the plot is slow-moving and the finale is laughable.I'm not an enthusiast of "Amityville" series,however this seventh installment is actually passable,if you are in the right mood.6 out of 10.

    (Plot) An old mirror winds up being bought by a photographer, and it ends up causing a whole lot of problems. Is the Mirror possessing some sort of evil? Of course Sherlock! I had one thought that kept recurring through my mind as I was watching this. How did this DTV piece of junk managed to assemble such a great cast? Were they in need of work that badly? David Naughton (who has a thankless role) Julia Nickson (of Rambo II fame) Richard Roundtree, Lin Shaye, Robert Rusler, and Terry O'Quinn (Stepfather I & II) You would think it would be better off served for a film worthy of their talents My problem with this movie is the same problem I have with a lot of the Amityville movies. They stay near trouble especially in Julia Nickson's case. The way her character is written made my head spin. It also lacks suspense or even the slightest amounts of entertainment. I enjoy low budget movies when they are fun, but this is derived of fun completely and it just gets increasingly sillier throughout the film Final Thoughts: It's a DTV sequel to a movie that shouldn't have spawned so many sequels to begin with, but it sure beats the heck out of watching this movie. Stay away 2/10

    At the rate these movies are rummaging through the artifacts from the Amityville house it won't be long before they get down to the floorboards, but for now it's a mirror that's causing problems for more cardboard characters in this sixth instalment. A homeless man hands the mirror over to artist Ross Partridge and his huge hair, which leads to strange visions, and unpleasant revelations about his past, and some truly ropey performances. This is a mundane horror film that plods along at a dull pace, leaving us waiting for an atmospheric build-up that never comes as the movie instead offers a variety of supposedly spooky events that lead clumsily to a silly finale. Bland and lifeless, a long way from the genuinely unsettling original.

    Mirror Mirror On The Wall: Who Is The Worst Amityville Of Them All Oh the horror! The streak of rotten "Amityville Horror" sequels continues in "Amityville: A New Generation." In the direct-to-video affair, an up-and-coming photographer (Ross Partridge, whose credentials include (1) episode of "In Living Color" as well as playing "Businessman" in the "Prom Night" remake) brings a haunted mirror back to his hip and happening pad. It's not long before the mirror starts distorting reality, shedding some light on the wannabe-artist's past as well as threatening his circle of friends which includes Shaft and Asian-Shannon Doherty in its ranks. Yet another "Amityville" flick where the "Horror" happens outside of the iconic house from the Margot Kidder/James Brolin original, it's no surprise to find "A New Generation" deviating even further from the original formula than before. Not that twisting the formula is such a bad thing -- it sort of worked in "Amityville 1992: It's About Time" (sort of) -- but the execution leaves quite a bit to be desired. For those keeping score, "Amityville: A New Generation" is the seventh installment in the shockingly long-winded and consistently mediocre "Amityville Horror" franchise. It's to be expected that the film isn't exactly top-notch material, but even judging it as a b-movie doesn't do it justice. The plot, if you can call it that, is really just an excuse for the presence of some admittedly cool paintings and softcore nudity (its only redeeming features, really). The horror in this "Amityville Horror" is in its banality. There is simply no tension to be found, and the bloodshed is kept to a minimum. Add this to the fact that hardly anybody in the film (save for Roundtree and Terry O'Quinn, cashing a check in an otherwise thankless role) can act to save their lives, and you have one very tepid experience. Even those who lapped up the schlock served up in the silly movie-of-the-week "Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes" or even the aforementioned 1992 affair will be hard-pressed to find anything redeeming about "A New Generation." To be quite frank, it's a chore to sit through and even when the film tries to twist things in an effort to re-connect itself to its roots, it just doesn't work. Whatever thrills were to be had with this premise were squeezed out by the anemic sequels that came before. Even if you enjoy cinematic junk food like this, approach with caution. This is not only the "Amityville" franchise at its worst, but also bottom-of-the-barrel even as far as '90s horror and DTV fare go.

    The plot A man in talking to a trap, who end up giving him this mirror, this time is mirror that has the evil force in it. This guy then gives the mirror to the next door neighbours and soon anyone who look into the mirror will die. It was good idea but they could have done so much more thing with it and better, this is a stand alone movie so it not connected to any of the other in series, saying that this is third stand alone movie in the series The acting in this movie was not that bad but the movie it self was way to predicable and can be really, really boring at time, i wish there was a lot more gore then there was, it did enjoy one or two so what gory scene that had in this movie, which really well shot. This is the weakest of them of all, it not the worse one in the series as The Amityville Curse is still the worse of the series, this movie in the second worse but still watchable unlike The Amityville Curse. I going to give this movie 3 out of 10

    'A New Generation' is the third Amityville entry to base its plot around writer John G. Jones's premise of an item taken from the Long Island house that causes spectral misery and death for its new owners. First a lamp, then a clock, and now a mirror. However, this is also the first Amityville since 'The Possession' to directly tie in to the real- life events that started the whole series. This time around, Keyes Terry (Robert Partridge), an artist, is given a macabre-looking mirror by a homeless man one day. Soon enough, people around him start to die, eventually leading to his discovery that the mirror once hung in the Amityville house - indeed on the very night a man named Franklin Bronner (Sonny Montelli in 'Amityville II') murdered his entire family. Unfortunately for Terry, his discovery of the mirror isn't entirely coincidental, and he soon learns the truth about his past a truth he's kept buried since childhood. This 7th installment in the often worn-out franchise is something of a disappointment for me. Things were starting to pick up with the silly and uneven, yet entertaining 'It's About Time', and given how much this film tries to draw upon its roots - not the first episode, but the source material itself - it should have been better than it was. However, three trips to the same well with yet another evil artifact from the Amityville house with yet another explanation for the malign paranormal visitations is wearing on me, to say the least. One of the biggest weaknesses of the Amityville franchise is the steadfast determination by each set of producers to completely ignore every other episode in the series. On the one hand, it's perfectly reasonable that they don't want to be tied to someone else's continuity, but at the very least, they could maybe acknowledge story lines that have already been done and just possibly *not repeat them over and over again*. There's also something rather plodding about the way in which the story unfolds, doubtless due to the inevitability this repetition-fest brings. Since you already know what's going to happen, the carefully-paced build-up is simply slow and tedious. Or maybe it's just tedious anyway. Director John Murlowski probably could have done more to heighten the tense atmosphere associated with the mirror rather than simply having it flash red and emit chattering 'evil' voices, which lacks any kind of subtlety. There were times when characters seemed fairly unfazed by its otherworldly qualities. If they don't take it too seriously, why should we? Which is a shame, because 'A New Generation' has a more-than-capable cast. I was going to hold off on watching this until I saw the name 'Julia Nickson' in the credits. She captivated my attention just as she always does, and if anything, I was annoyed her part wasn't more extensive. Terry O'Quinn was equally charismatic and again, underused. Partridge himself in the lead role clearly fits the early 90s over-coiffed lumberjack-shirted square-jawed hero type, and while I'm not sure he really gave it the gravitas needed, it's not as if anyone here is performing Ibsen. The sets are also worthy of note, from the dramatic artwork filling Suki's room, to the claustrophobic corridors featured in flashback/supernatural sequences. Getting the look of these right is especially important given how certain sequences are repeated throughout the film to simulated fragmented memories. Clearly, Murlowski is more of a visual director rather than either an actor's director or one of horror. Unfortunately, it is meant to be a horror film, after all. 'A New Generation' sees the same race being run for the third time in 4 years. Add to this the lack of direction where it was really needed and the whole effort fails to stand as tall as it should. However, it should be acknowledged for its strong ties with the source material and some good actors in not necessarily their finest hours. Honestly, the ideal person for this is someone who hasn't seen any of the sequels past 'The Possession', for whom the story won't be such a massive deja-vu trip.

    Oh dear. This sequel has a mirror, this time, which houses the evil spirit of a psychopath which murdered an entire family with a shotgun in the Amityville home. The mirror captured the entire ugly incident of the horrified family who had no time to prepare for their uninvited guest. The mirror is given to a photographer, Keyes(Ross Partridge)by a bum(..who just so happens to be his lunatic father, and the man responsible for killing the family)and it's evil soon terrorizes those in a loft(..such as Keyes' painter pal Suki, portrayed by Julia Nickson-Soul)where he lives when they look into it. Soon Keyes is having nightmares, looking through the eyes of his father as he guns down the family in cold blood, worried that he might follow in his footsteps. Soon he sees other occurrences through his father's eyes like that terrible day pops bashed his mother's head against the floor of an institution or experiencing a moment inside the cell as doctor's administered a drug to immobilize him. Pretty solid supporting cast who deserve better than being stuck in junk like this, such as David Naughton(American Werewolf in London)as the proprietor of the loft with which Keyes lives, Richard Roundtree as an eccentric sculptor/artist, Terry O'Quinn as a psychologist-detective, and especially Lin Shaye as a hilarious ditsy, rather strange secretary-nurse in the asylum(..the one which held Keyes' father) soon to be closed down. Rounding out the film, the sexy, leggy Lala Sloatman as Keyes' supportive girlfriend, Barbara Howard(Friday the 13th:The Final Chapter)as Naughton's betrayed wife(..he was on the verge of starting an affair with Nickman-Soul), Jack Orend as the sadistic fiend who attempts to provoke his son into killing innocent people as he did, and Robert Rusler(A Nightmare on Elm Street 2:Freddy's Revenge)as a rejected lover(..of Nickson-Soul)who meets an unfortunate demise while ripping apart paintings as a revenge for his dismissal. This film is a poor special effects movie merely using the Amityville title as a cash-in. The franchise has never been that great to begin with, but as each sequel was green-lit, it grew worse and worse. After the third film, furniture from the infamous house become "possessed" items tormenting folks. The cast try hard, though, but the material(..a mirror causing chaos and murder through supernatural means)is lacking in quality..and the rather mediocre special effects don't help matters. O'Quinn, as little as he has to work with, shows why he's such a great actor, he can even shine in excrement such as this. All's not lost, you get to see Sloatman always wearing super short skirts(..or her man's shirt in panties), showing off her legs throughout..hey, you have to find a silver lining somewhere. Believe it or not, AMITYVILLE:A NEW GENERATION was the seventh film in the franchise! Coolest part of the film were the portraits of demons painted by Nickson-Soul's artist, perhaps inspired by the evil mirror after looking into it.

    After 'Amityville 1992: It's About Time' breathed some much needed life into this dying franchise it was no surprise that another sequel was on the way. A year later the writers of the previous film produced this installment, which like it's predecessor and 1989s 'Amityville 4: The Evil Escapes' was inspired by John G. Jone's book 'Amityville: The Evil Escapes' in that it involves a possessed object from the infamous Long Island house. But after such a winner could they really hit again? In this case they did for the most part. Won't go down as one of the best horror sequels in history, but for a seventh film in a series that went directly to video it's a heck of a lot better and enjoyable than it has any right to be. Pros: Well-written. Nice work from the cast. Daniel Licht who scored the previous sequel returns with a very different, but equally memorable and even beautiful score. Some decent supernatural deaths. Moves at kind of a slow, but steady pace. Some respectable twists and turns. One really creepy chase sequence involving a demon. A pretty powerful ending. Cons: Mediocre direction. Not really very scary. Some cheap and unscary looking monster make-up. Final thoughts: Sure none of these sequels to the original will be remembered for being great, but you could find ones that are far more unwatchable and that make you feel bad for those involved. All things considered, 'A New Generation' is an above average continuation of the legacy that is Amityville. My rating: 3.5/5
