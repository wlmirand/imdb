    A seemingly home-spun boxer gets accused of a murder he didn't commit and goes on the run. Fortunately for him, he's believed to be dead so he blends right in with the Dead End Kids, picking dates on an Arizona farm. Unfortunately for him, a determined detective spots him in a newspaper photo, and his cover is endangered. Another imitator of Fury, the classic early film noir with a very similar set-up, this one suffers slightly from both predictability and a generic structure. Where it succeeds is with the superb Warner Brothers technology and a dream cast of contract players. John Garfield plays a media darling, so perfect with public relations that he publicly thanks his mother, whom we never even see. His phoniness is exposed the minute the camera is off and the booze flows. Ann Sheridan is wasted as his floozy moll, the real leading lady the lesser known Gloria Dickson who works on the date farm supervising the Dead End Kids. Claude Rains is, as always, impressive as the desperate detective, a much more low-key variation of Les Miserables' Javert, albeit one with a soft touch and cynical sense of humor. He's been beaten by life and empathizes with Garfield. A true scene-stealing performance comes from May Robson who combines love, no-nonsense and a thrilling love of boxing that creates a lot of humor. Being a remake of an earlier pre-code film with elements of film noir thrown in, the result is a noble try that doesn't completely come off but isn't a dud, either. The fact that this is directed by veteran choreographer Busby Berkley without any of his famous over-the-head camera shots of chorus girls makes this even more interesting.

    A compact drama about redemption. John Garfield, always a powerful screen presence, makes a strong impression in the lead as an initially corrupt boxer who sees the error of his ways. The Dead End Kids are well used and the sassy May Robson brightens any movie in which she appeared. Be aware that Ann Sheridan, although prominently billed, is in and out of the movie in about 5 minutes, however Gloria Dickson makes a fine showing. At this point she was considered an actress on the way up but ended up spending most of her brief career in low budget films before her death in a fire at 28. The one small problem is the casting of Claude Rains as a dogged detective. He was always a fantastic actor and gives a professional performance but the part doesn't play to his strengths of urbanity and wit. Berkeley, taking a break from musicals, maintains a brisk pace in the direction making this one of the better programmers to come out of the Warners factory.

    A mix of comedy and crime that doesn't quite work and is woefully dated. But there is some charm that remains and it is an entertaining, if somewhat forced, blend that may suffer from a bit too much of some things and not enough of others. The first half of a deadly serious frame up and setup is effective as an innocent man is sent on the lam. Then the films switches tone and locales and the combination of slapstick and over the top acting does not fare as well. To be kind it is a good effort but the parts don't do the whole justice. There are some exciting scenes and some funny and tender ones, the problem is that they don't always make a satisfying connection. John Garfield is always a force on screen and delivers, as usual, a knockout performance, but Claude Raines is miscast to the point of distraction. The Dead End Kids do their usual routines and the Director is competent enough, although competent would hardly describe his excellent, eye-popping, ground-breaking musicals.

    This was John Garfield's second film following hard on the heels of his debut in Four Daughters (in which Claude Rains was much better cast as a father than he is here as Javert with an American accent). Inexplicably Ann Sheridan, a natural foil for Garfield and an actress who revelled in low-key dialog ("you couldn't even afford the headlights" was her come- back to the diner who observed 'some chassis' in They Drive By Night) and would certainly have matched Garfield crack for crack, is written out in the second reel leaving Gloria Dickson - a fine actress but no match for Sheridan in trading dialog - as the love interest. The plot's a tad predictable but this was 1939 and audiences were more than happy with a mixture of clich&eacute; and sentiment provided it was pacey and punchy and this delivers on both counts.

    It's a Warner Bros. production, in spadesfrom Garfield to the gritty subject matter to the seedy surroundings. If MGM was the glamour studio, Warner's was the no-nonsense Plain Jane. Here boxing champ Johnnie (Garfield) hobos it to the California desert to escape a New York murder rap. There he hooks up with tough blonde (Dickson) and her juvenile delinquent date pickers (Gorcey, et. al.). Trouble is that Detective Phelin (Rains) won't give up the chase, and now Johnnie's in a pickle he can't fight his way out of. Okay, nothing unusual about the plot, except maybe the setting. Nevertheless, director Busby Berkeley manages to blend the elements into a good gritty little tale. Well, that's except for the fight scenes, which prove Berkeley was better at arranging dancers than boxers. Even so, he makes maybe the best use of that ragamuffin outfit that would become the Bowery Boys that I've seen. Even the usually buffoonish Huntz Hall is under firm control. But maybe the biggest challenge was getting aristocratic Claude Rains to impersonate a street wise New York cop, of all things. Fortunately, that excellent actor pulls it off better than expected. And, of course, there's the great Garfield showing why his brand of feisty urban grit was so perfect for the times. Then there's the one scene that still has me sweating. Johnnie and the boys are cooling off inside a big water-filled irrigation tank. Okay, no problem. Except, farmer somebody decides his date trees need water, and before they know it, the boys are clawing at the bare metal sides, trying to escape the ten feet of water he's left in the bottom. Sure, they're okay, but only so long as they keep swimming and swimming, trapped like flotsam in a fish bowl. It's a sweaty doomsday setup that comes out of nowhere. Anyway, this is the type of film that made me a fan of hardscrabble Warner Bros. of the 1930's. So catch up with it if you can.

    This movie started out for me on the upside. John Garfield was such an attractive actor at this stage in his career, and the part he played here showed promise -- a shady boxer who had an undeservedly positive reputation. Then, instead of living with his mother (as he projects to the public), he is carousing with a sleazy girlfriend (a young Ann Sheridan), punches someone, and accidentally kills him. Sheridan and the boxer's doctor speed away out of fear, crash their car, and are burned to death, and the police assume Garfield burned up in the car (due to circumstantial evidence). Garfield realizes he can be accused of murder, so he heads west on little money and ends up in a date grove. Okay up till that point...but who is working in the date grove but the Dead End Kids...really??? The Dead End Kids working in a date grove in Arizona? Hisses and boos. Garfield is taken in by the funny mix of people living here -- May Robson is great as the mother figure, Gloria Dickson excellent as the romantic interest (too bad she had such a short life and career due to burning alive in a house fire), Claude Rains in a remarkably offbeat performance as a police investigator, and Ward Bond as a fight promoter. Ironically, to avoid being caught by Claude Rains, Garfield tries to get out of a public fight by saying the doctor turned down his participation due to a "bad ticker"...exactly what killed Garfield 13 years later at the age of 39. I'd give it a "7" without the Dead End Kids.

    John Garfield is a promising but dissolute boxer in New York. He gets boozed up at one of his parties, takes a swing at a guest, and passes out. His treacherous manager hits the offending guest with a bottle and kills him. Then he arranges things so that it looks as if Garfield has killed the man in a drunken rage. The manager takes off and is killed in a car accident. Result, Garfield is about to be arrested for the crime and instead takes to the road with only $250 in his pocket, with a police detective, Claude Raines, keeping a keen lookout for his whereabouts. Garfield becomes a bum, riding the rails, looking for work, hiding the fact that he's a boxer because any popularity along those lines might lead to Raines' attention. He winds up at a cozy reform school for boys in Palm Desert, California, run by a warm blond, Gloria Dixon, and her oh-so-Irish mother. Their only consignment is half a dozen kids from the New York slums, the Dead End Kids, who pick dates from the groves and sell them to the few passers by in this isolated little farm. The problem is that the place is going broke and they're cut off from any outside financial help. One of the kids has a dream of opening a gas station. They are the only house on a 60-mile stretch of empty road so the prospects are good, but a gas pump costs $2000. They don't have $2000. Dixon, grandma, and the kids have barely enough to live on. Then, through the seasonable interposition of a gracious Providence, a big brute of a fighter, Gaspar Rutchek by name, comes to town offering a couple of grand to anyone who can stay in the ring with him for three rounds. At first, Garfield is excited because, after all, he's a professional fighter himself, though far outweighed by the much larger Rutchek. He signs up for the contest and goes into training, but a photo of him alerts Claude Raines and brings him to Palm Desert. Garfield knows this, but gets into the ring anyway. He's clobbered by Rutchek but gets through three rounds and wins enough to buy the pump and open the gas station. The moment he recovers, he's placed under arrest, but Garfield's parting scene with Dixon convinces Raines that Garfield is kewl and Raines lets him go back to his sere paradise and his juicy blond. Well -- "they" didn't make him a criminal. He made himself a criminal by acting like one after having been labeled a "murderer" by Claude Raines. After all, instead of running away, he COULD have gone to the police and hired a good defense counsel. In real life, I expect he would have been convicted anyway, but not in movies like this. It's a near-perfect illustration of labeling theory in sociology. Anybody interested can Google it, but I'll give one example taken from a study of wounded veterans. Many were in pain and given morphine, to which they became somewhat addicted. Their withdrawal was distressing. Some were never told the reason for their distress, and they went on to normal lives. Those who were told that they were addicted to morphine went on to careers as drug addicts because they'd been "labelled" as such by the authorities. (I'm simplifying, but you can understand why.) The general idea is that if everyone treats you as a rat, then eventually you come to believe that you're a no-good skank and you act appropriately. We derive our identities from the way others treat us. That's what happens to Garfield in New York, with his manager and Raines telling him he's a murderer. So he acts like one and becomes a fugitive. I'll skip any further details. Garfield is as good as he usually is, which is to say he's professional. I understand there are viewers who like him a lot, and indeed he was in real life a stand-up guy, but as an actor he's no better and no worse than most others in the Warner Brothers' stable -- Alan Hale, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and the rest. Gloria Dixon doesn't make much of an impression. Grandma is a comic stereotype. The Dead End kids still were integral to a serious plot -- not yet part of a formula -- and aren't bad, especially in a scene in which they're about to drown in a water tank in the desert. Busby Berkeley, of all people, is responsible for the direction of this depression-era story. He's pretty much functional, no more than that. His innovative impulses seem to be reserved for expression during fantasmic shots of multitudes of girls shaping themselves into roses and signs displaying the benign features of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It's an interesting story, though, without much in the way of ambition or style. Not memorable, but not insultingly corny either.

    After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is blamed. When the manager dies in a car crash, wearing Garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. Still a WANTED man, Garfield changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as T.B.), and Bernard Punsly (as Milt). Garfield bonds with the young "Dead End" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids make beautiful (Max Steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form. Garfield and the "Dead End" kids are a winning combination; although Garfield made no further movies with the "East Side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost immediately, for "Dust Be My Destiny". The boxing scenes are nicely staged. But, the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the New York "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall, and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. Other, more brief, highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), boozy Barbara Pepper (as Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) losing at strip poker. ******** They Made Me a Criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Claude Rains

    This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent film experience. It wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.

    John Garfield...The "Dead End" Kids...Claude Rains...and a wrong-man-fingered theme. Not likely ingredients for director Busby Berkeley, the master of the gaudy musical showstopper. Still, this Warner Bros. remake of 1933's "The Life Of Jimmy Dolan" is satisfying on a minor scale, despite the feeling these disparate talents could have certainly come up with something more intriguing than your average "B" programmer. Prize-fighter takes the fall when his weaselly manager accidentally kills a reporter; hiding out on a date farm in Arizona, one doesn't have wait too long before the good guy tips his hand (to a morgue worker playing amateur detective!). There are interesting asides (Garfield and the Kids finding trouble while swimming in a water tank), dumb/funny ones (the Kids bilking a twelve-year-old cadet out of his clothes and movie camera), as well as excruciating scenes (all of which involve Rains' detective with his meathead boss back in New York). The romance subplot between Garfield and rancher Gloria Dickson just squeaks by, and Garfield's wise-guy cadence is tiresome to listen to (probably because it's so artificial). However, the film looks handsome enough, is given a lively pace, and the general overacting is agreeable within this context--the slim plot being so preconceived, all we have left to respond to are the characters. **1/2 from ****

    John Garfield is a promising but dissolute boxer in New York. He gets boozed up at one of his parties, takes a swing at a guest, and passes out. His treacherous manager hits the offending guest with a bottle and kills him. Then he arranges things so that it looks as if Garfield has killed the man in a drunken rage. The manager takes off and is killed in a car accident. Result, Garfield is about to be arrested for the crime and instead takes to the road with only $250 in his pocket, with a police detective, Claude Raines, keeping a keen lookout for his whereabouts. Garfield becomes a bum, riding the rails, looking for work, hiding the fact that he's a boxer because any popularity along those lines might lead to Raines' attention. He winds up at a cozy reform school for boys in Palm Desert, California, run by a warm blond, Gloria Dixon, and her oh-so-Irish mother. Their only consignment is half a dozen kids from the New York slums, the Dead End Kids, who pick dates from the groves and sell them to the few passers by in this isolated little farm. The problem is that the place is going broke and they're cut off from any outside financial help. One of the kids has a dream of opening a gas station. They are the only house on a 60-mile stretch of empty road so the prospects are good, but a gas pump costs $2000. They don't have $2000. Dixon, grandma, and the kids have barely enough to live on. Then, through the seasonable interposition of a gracious Providence, a big brute of a fighter, Gaspar Rutchek by name, comes to town offering a couple of grand to anyone who can stay in the ring with him for three rounds. At first, Garfield is excited because, after all, he's a professional fighter himself, though far outweighed by the much larger Rutchek. He signs up for the contest and goes into training, but a photo of him alerts Claude Raines and brings him to Palm Desert. Garfield knows this, but gets into the ring anyway. He's clobbered by Rutchek but gets through three rounds and wins enough to buy the pump and open the gas station. The moment he recovers, he's placed under arrest, but Garfield's parting scene with Dixon convinces Raines that Garfield is kewl and Raines lets him go back to his sere paradise and his juicy blond. Well -- "they" didn't make him a criminal. He made himself a criminal by acting like one after having been labeled a "murderer" by Claude Raines. After all, instead of running away, he COULD have gone to the police and hired a good defense counsel. In real life, I expect he would have been convicted anyway, but not in movies like this. It's a near-perfect illustration of labeling theory in sociology. Anybody interested can Google it, but I'll give one example taken from a study of wounded veterans. Many were in pain and given morphine, to which they became somewhat addicted. Their withdrawal was distressing. Some were never told the reason for their distress, and they went on to normal lives. Those who were told that they were addicted to morphine went on to careers as drug addicts because they'd been "labelled" as such by the authorities. (I'm simplifying, but you can understand why.) The general idea is that if everyone treats you as a rat, then eventually you come to believe that you're a no-good skank and you act appropriately. We derive our identities from the way others treat us. That's what happens to Garfield in New York, with his manager and Raines telling him he's a murderer. So he acts like one and becomes a fugitive. I'll skip any further details. Garfield is as good as he usually is, which is to say he's professional. I understand there are viewers who like him a lot, and indeed he was in real life a stand-up guy, but as an actor he's no better and no worse than most others in the Warner Brothers' stable -- Alan Hale, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and the rest. Gloria Dixon doesn't make much of an impression. Grandma is a comic stereotype. The Dead End kids still were integral to a serious plot -- not yet part of a formula -- and aren't bad, especially in a scene in which they're about to drown in a water tank in the desert. Busby Berkeley, of all people, is responsible for the direction of this depression-era story. He's pretty much functional, no more than that. His innovative impulses seem to be reserved for expression during fantasmic shots of multitudes of girls shaping themselves into roses and signs displaying the benign features of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It's an interesting story, though, without much in the way of ambition or style. Not memorable, but not insultingly corny either.

    After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is blamed. When the manager dies in a car crash, wearing Garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. Still a WANTED man, Garfield changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as T.B.), and Bernard Punsly (as Milt). Garfield bonds with the young "Dead End" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids make beautiful (Max Steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form. Garfield and the "Dead End" kids are a winning combination; although Garfield made no further movies with the "East Side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost immediately, for "Dust Be My Destiny". The boxing scenes are nicely staged. But, the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the New York "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall, and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. Other, more brief, highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), boozy Barbara Pepper (as Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) losing at strip poker. ******** They Made Me a Criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Claude Rains

    This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent film experience. It wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.

    John Garfield...The "Dead End" Kids...Claude Rains...and a wrong-man-fingered theme. Not likely ingredients for director Busby Berkeley, the master of the gaudy musical showstopper. Still, this Warner Bros. remake of 1933's "The Life Of Jimmy Dolan" is satisfying on a minor scale, despite the feeling these disparate talents could have certainly come up with something more intriguing than your average "B" programmer. Prize-fighter takes the fall when his weaselly manager accidentally kills a reporter; hiding out on a date farm in Arizona, one doesn't have wait too long before the good guy tips his hand (to a morgue worker playing amateur detective!). There are interesting asides (Garfield and the Kids finding trouble while swimming in a water tank), dumb/funny ones (the Kids bilking a twelve-year-old cadet out of his clothes and movie camera), as well as excruciating scenes (all of which involve Rains' detective with his meathead boss back in New York). The romance subplot between Garfield and rancher Gloria Dickson just squeaks by, and Garfield's wise-guy cadence is tiresome to listen to (probably because it's so artificial). However, the film looks handsome enough, is given a lively pace, and the general overacting is agreeable within this context--the slim plot being so preconceived, all we have left to respond to are the characters. **1/2 from ****

    A seemingly home-spun boxer gets accused of a murder he didn't commit and goes on the run. Fortunately for him, he's believed to be dead so he blends right in with the Dead End Kids, picking dates on an Arizona farm. Unfortunately for him, a determined detective spots him in a newspaper photo, and his cover is endangered. Another imitator of Fury, the classic early film noir with a very similar set-up, this one suffers slightly from both predictability and a generic structure. Where it succeeds is with the superb Warner Brothers technology and a dream cast of contract players. John Garfield plays a media darling, so perfect with public relations that he publicly thanks his mother, whom we never even see. His phoniness is exposed the minute the camera is off and the booze flows. Ann Sheridan is wasted as his floozy moll, the real leading lady the lesser known Gloria Dickson who works on the date farm supervising the Dead End Kids. Claude Rains is, as always, impressive as the desperate detective, a much more low-key variation of Les Miserables' Javert, albeit one with a soft touch and cynical sense of humor. He's been beaten by life and empathizes with Garfield. A true scene-stealing performance comes from May Robson who combines love, no-nonsense and a thrilling love of boxing that creates a lot of humor. Being a remake of an earlier pre-code film with elements of film noir thrown in, the result is a noble try that doesn't completely come off but isn't a dud, either. The fact that this is directed by veteran choreographer Busby Berkley without any of his famous over-the-head camera shots of chorus girls makes this even more interesting.

    A compact drama about redemption. John Garfield, always a powerful screen presence, makes a strong impression in the lead as an initially corrupt boxer who sees the error of his ways. The Dead End Kids are well used and the sassy May Robson brightens any movie in which she appeared. Be aware that Ann Sheridan, although prominently billed, is in and out of the movie in about 5 minutes, however Gloria Dickson makes a fine showing. At this point she was considered an actress on the way up but ended up spending most of her brief career in low budget films before her death in a fire at 28. The one small problem is the casting of Claude Rains as a dogged detective. He was always a fantastic actor and gives a professional performance but the part doesn't play to his strengths of urbanity and wit. Berkeley, taking a break from musicals, maintains a brisk pace in the direction making this one of the better programmers to come out of the Warners factory.

    A mix of comedy and crime that doesn't quite work and is woefully dated. But there is some charm that remains and it is an entertaining, if somewhat forced, blend that may suffer from a bit too much of some things and not enough of others. The first half of a deadly serious frame up and setup is effective as an innocent man is sent on the lam. Then the films switches tone and locales and the combination of slapstick and over the top acting does not fare as well. To be kind it is a good effort but the parts don't do the whole justice. There are some exciting scenes and some funny and tender ones, the problem is that they don't always make a satisfying connection. John Garfield is always a force on screen and delivers, as usual, a knockout performance, but Claude Raines is miscast to the point of distraction. The Dead End Kids do their usual routines and the Director is competent enough, although competent would hardly describe his excellent, eye-popping, ground-breaking musicals.

    This was John Garfield's second film following hard on the heels of his debut in Four Daughters (in which Claude Rains was much better cast as a father than he is here as Javert with an American accent). Inexplicably Ann Sheridan, a natural foil for Garfield and an actress who revelled in low-key dialog ("you couldn't even afford the headlights" was her come- back to the diner who observed 'some chassis' in They Drive By Night) and would certainly have matched Garfield crack for crack, is written out in the second reel leaving Gloria Dickson - a fine actress but no match for Sheridan in trading dialog - as the love interest. The plot's a tad predictable but this was 1939 and audiences were more than happy with a mixture of clich&eacute; and sentiment provided it was pacey and punchy and this delivers on both counts.

    It's a Warner Bros. production, in spadesfrom Garfield to the gritty subject matter to the seedy surroundings. If MGM was the glamour studio, Warner's was the no-nonsense Plain Jane. Here boxing champ Johnnie (Garfield) hobos it to the California desert to escape a New York murder rap. There he hooks up with tough blonde (Dickson) and her juvenile delinquent date pickers (Gorcey, et. al.). Trouble is that Detective Phelin (Rains) won't give up the chase, and now Johnnie's in a pickle he can't fight his way out of. Okay, nothing unusual about the plot, except maybe the setting. Nevertheless, director Busby Berkeley manages to blend the elements into a good gritty little tale. Well, that's except for the fight scenes, which prove Berkeley was better at arranging dancers than boxers. Even so, he makes maybe the best use of that ragamuffin outfit that would become the Bowery Boys that I've seen. Even the usually buffoonish Huntz Hall is under firm control. But maybe the biggest challenge was getting aristocratic Claude Rains to impersonate a street wise New York cop, of all things. Fortunately, that excellent actor pulls it off better than expected. And, of course, there's the great Garfield showing why his brand of feisty urban grit was so perfect for the times. Then there's the one scene that still has me sweating. Johnnie and the boys are cooling off inside a big water-filled irrigation tank. Okay, no problem. Except, farmer somebody decides his date trees need water, and before they know it, the boys are clawing at the bare metal sides, trying to escape the ten feet of water he's left in the bottom. Sure, they're okay, but only so long as they keep swimming and swimming, trapped like flotsam in a fish bowl. It's a sweaty doomsday setup that comes out of nowhere. Anyway, this is the type of film that made me a fan of hardscrabble Warner Bros. of the 1930's. So catch up with it if you can.

    This movie started out for me on the upside. John Garfield was such an attractive actor at this stage in his career, and the part he played here showed promise -- a shady boxer who had an undeservedly positive reputation. Then, instead of living with his mother (as he projects to the public), he is carousing with a sleazy girlfriend (a young Ann Sheridan), punches someone, and accidentally kills him. Sheridan and the boxer's doctor speed away out of fear, crash their car, and are burned to death, and the police assume Garfield burned up in the car (due to circumstantial evidence). Garfield realizes he can be accused of murder, so he heads west on little money and ends up in a date grove. Okay up till that point...but who is working in the date grove but the Dead End Kids...really??? The Dead End Kids working in a date grove in Arizona? Hisses and boos. Garfield is taken in by the funny mix of people living here -- May Robson is great as the mother figure, Gloria Dickson excellent as the romantic interest (too bad she had such a short life and career due to burning alive in a house fire), Claude Rains in a remarkably offbeat performance as a police investigator, and Ward Bond as a fight promoter. Ironically, to avoid being caught by Claude Rains, Garfield tries to get out of a public fight by saying the doctor turned down his participation due to a "bad ticker"...exactly what killed Garfield 13 years later at the age of 39. I'd give it a "7" without the Dead End Kids.

    A compact drama about redemption. John Garfield, always a powerful screen presence, makes a strong impression in the lead as an initially corrupt boxer who sees the error of his ways. The Dead End Kids are well used and the sassy May Robson brightens any movie in which she appeared. Be aware that Ann Sheridan, although prominently billed, is in and out of the movie in about 5 minutes, however Gloria Dickson makes a fine showing. At this point she was considered an actress on the way up but ended up spending most of her brief career in low budget films before her death in a fire at 28. The one small problem is the casting of Claude Rains as a dogged detective. He was always a fantastic actor and gives a professional performance but the part doesn't play to his strengths of urbanity and wit. Berkeley, taking a break from musicals, maintains a brisk pace in the direction making this one of the better programmers to come out of the Warners factory.

    A mix of comedy and crime that doesn't quite work and is woefully dated. But there is some charm that remains and it is an entertaining, if somewhat forced, blend that may suffer from a bit too much of some things and not enough of others. The first half of a deadly serious frame up and setup is effective as an innocent man is sent on the lam. Then the films switches tone and locales and the combination of slapstick and over the top acting does not fare as well. To be kind it is a good effort but the parts don't do the whole justice. There are some exciting scenes and some funny and tender ones, the problem is that they don't always make a satisfying connection. John Garfield is always a force on screen and delivers, as usual, a knockout performance, but Claude Raines is miscast to the point of distraction. The Dead End Kids do their usual routines and the Director is competent enough, although competent would hardly describe his excellent, eye-popping, ground-breaking musicals.

    This was John Garfield's second film following hard on the heels of his debut in Four Daughters (in which Claude Rains was much better cast as a father than he is here as Javert with an American accent). Inexplicably Ann Sheridan, a natural foil for Garfield and an actress who revelled in low-key dialog ("you couldn't even afford the headlights" was her come- back to the diner who observed 'some chassis' in They Drive By Night) and would certainly have matched Garfield crack for crack, is written out in the second reel leaving Gloria Dickson - a fine actress but no match for Sheridan in trading dialog - as the love interest. The plot's a tad predictable but this was 1939 and audiences were more than happy with a mixture of clich&eacute; and sentiment provided it was pacey and punchy and this delivers on both counts.

    It's a Warner Bros. production, in spadesfrom Garfield to the gritty subject matter to the seedy surroundings. If MGM was the glamour studio, Warner's was the no-nonsense Plain Jane. Here boxing champ Johnnie (Garfield) hobos it to the California desert to escape a New York murder rap. There he hooks up with tough blonde (Dickson) and her juvenile delinquent date pickers (Gorcey, et. al.). Trouble is that Detective Phelin (Rains) won't give up the chase, and now Johnnie's in a pickle he can't fight his way out of. Okay, nothing unusual about the plot, except maybe the setting. Nevertheless, director Busby Berkeley manages to blend the elements into a good gritty little tale. Well, that's except for the fight scenes, which prove Berkeley was better at arranging dancers than boxers. Even so, he makes maybe the best use of that ragamuffin outfit that would become the Bowery Boys that I've seen. Even the usually buffoonish Huntz Hall is under firm control. But maybe the biggest challenge was getting aristocratic Claude Rains to impersonate a street wise New York cop, of all things. Fortunately, that excellent actor pulls it off better than expected. And, of course, there's the great Garfield showing why his brand of feisty urban grit was so perfect for the times. Then there's the one scene that still has me sweating. Johnnie and the boys are cooling off inside a big water-filled irrigation tank. Okay, no problem. Except, farmer somebody decides his date trees need water, and before they know it, the boys are clawing at the bare metal sides, trying to escape the ten feet of water he's left in the bottom. Sure, they're okay, but only so long as they keep swimming and swimming, trapped like flotsam in a fish bowl. It's a sweaty doomsday setup that comes out of nowhere. Anyway, this is the type of film that made me a fan of hardscrabble Warner Bros. of the 1930's. So catch up with it if you can.

    This movie started out for me on the upside. John Garfield was such an attractive actor at this stage in his career, and the part he played here showed promise -- a shady boxer who had an undeservedly positive reputation. Then, instead of living with his mother (as he projects to the public), he is carousing with a sleazy girlfriend (a young Ann Sheridan), punches someone, and accidentally kills him. Sheridan and the boxer's doctor speed away out of fear, crash their car, and are burned to death, and the police assume Garfield burned up in the car (due to circumstantial evidence). Garfield realizes he can be accused of murder, so he heads west on little money and ends up in a date grove. Okay up till that point...but who is working in the date grove but the Dead End Kids...really??? The Dead End Kids working in a date grove in Arizona? Hisses and boos. Garfield is taken in by the funny mix of people living here -- May Robson is great as the mother figure, Gloria Dickson excellent as the romantic interest (too bad she had such a short life and career due to burning alive in a house fire), Claude Rains in a remarkably offbeat performance as a police investigator, and Ward Bond as a fight promoter. Ironically, to avoid being caught by Claude Rains, Garfield tries to get out of a public fight by saying the doctor turned down his participation due to a "bad ticker"...exactly what killed Garfield 13 years later at the age of 39. I'd give it a "7" without the Dead End Kids.

    John Garfield is a promising but dissolute boxer in New York. He gets boozed up at one of his parties, takes a swing at a guest, and passes out. His treacherous manager hits the offending guest with a bottle and kills him. Then he arranges things so that it looks as if Garfield has killed the man in a drunken rage. The manager takes off and is killed in a car accident. Result, Garfield is about to be arrested for the crime and instead takes to the road with only $250 in his pocket, with a police detective, Claude Raines, keeping a keen lookout for his whereabouts. Garfield becomes a bum, riding the rails, looking for work, hiding the fact that he's a boxer because any popularity along those lines might lead to Raines' attention. He winds up at a cozy reform school for boys in Palm Desert, California, run by a warm blond, Gloria Dixon, and her oh-so-Irish mother. Their only consignment is half a dozen kids from the New York slums, the Dead End Kids, who pick dates from the groves and sell them to the few passers by in this isolated little farm. The problem is that the place is going broke and they're cut off from any outside financial help. One of the kids has a dream of opening a gas station. They are the only house on a 60-mile stretch of empty road so the prospects are good, but a gas pump costs $2000. They don't have $2000. Dixon, grandma, and the kids have barely enough to live on. Then, through the seasonable interposition of a gracious Providence, a big brute of a fighter, Gaspar Rutchek by name, comes to town offering a couple of grand to anyone who can stay in the ring with him for three rounds. At first, Garfield is excited because, after all, he's a professional fighter himself, though far outweighed by the much larger Rutchek. He signs up for the contest and goes into training, but a photo of him alerts Claude Raines and brings him to Palm Desert. Garfield knows this, but gets into the ring anyway. He's clobbered by Rutchek but gets through three rounds and wins enough to buy the pump and open the gas station. The moment he recovers, he's placed under arrest, but Garfield's parting scene with Dixon convinces Raines that Garfield is kewl and Raines lets him go back to his sere paradise and his juicy blond. Well -- "they" didn't make him a criminal. He made himself a criminal by acting like one after having been labeled a "murderer" by Claude Raines. After all, instead of running away, he COULD have gone to the police and hired a good defense counsel. In real life, I expect he would have been convicted anyway, but not in movies like this. It's a near-perfect illustration of labeling theory in sociology. Anybody interested can Google it, but I'll give one example taken from a study of wounded veterans. Many were in pain and given morphine, to which they became somewhat addicted. Their withdrawal was distressing. Some were never told the reason for their distress, and they went on to normal lives. Those who were told that they were addicted to morphine went on to careers as drug addicts because they'd been "labelled" as such by the authorities. (I'm simplifying, but you can understand why.) The general idea is that if everyone treats you as a rat, then eventually you come to believe that you're a no-good skank and you act appropriately. We derive our identities from the way others treat us. That's what happens to Garfield in New York, with his manager and Raines telling him he's a murderer. So he acts like one and becomes a fugitive. I'll skip any further details. Garfield is as good as he usually is, which is to say he's professional. I understand there are viewers who like him a lot, and indeed he was in real life a stand-up guy, but as an actor he's no better and no worse than most others in the Warner Brothers' stable -- Alan Hale, George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and the rest. Gloria Dixon doesn't make much of an impression. Grandma is a comic stereotype. The Dead End kids still were integral to a serious plot -- not yet part of a formula -- and aren't bad, especially in a scene in which they're about to drown in a water tank in the desert. Busby Berkeley, of all people, is responsible for the direction of this depression-era story. He's pretty much functional, no more than that. His innovative impulses seem to be reserved for expression during fantasmic shots of multitudes of girls shaping themselves into roses and signs displaying the benign features of Franklin Delano Roosevelt. It's an interesting story, though, without much in the way of ambition or style. Not memorable, but not insultingly corny either.

    John Garfield Gets in the Ring for Billy Halop and "The Dead End Kids"

    After winning a championship fight, boxer John Garfield (as Johnnie Bradfield) celebrates with a drinking binge, which leads to the manslaughter of a pushy reporter. Although his manager killed the man, Mr. Garfield is blamed. When the manager dies in a car crash, wearing Garfield's stolen watch, authorities think the boxer is dead. Still a WANTED man, Garfield changes his identity to "Jack Dorney" and moves to an Arizona ranch. There, Garfield meets "The Dead End Kids": Billy Halop (as Tommy), Bobby Jordan (as Angel), Leo Gorcey (as Spit), Huntz Hall (as Dippy), Gabriel Dell (as T.B.), and Bernard Punsly (as Milt). Garfield bonds with the young "Dead End" lads, who were sent to stay with sweet "Grandma Rafferty" (May Robson) as an alternative to reform school, courtesy of her brother, deceased priest "Father Rafferty". Garfield falls in love with Halop's sister, pretty "Peggy" (Gloria Dickson), who is there to keep any eye on the kids. Of course, Garfield's past comes back to haunt him John Garfield and The 'Dead End' Kids make beautiful (Max Steiner) music together, thanks to effective direction and photography, by Busby Berkeley and James Wong Howe. The story is predictably comfortable, with the Warner Brothers support team in fine form. Garfield and the "Dead End" kids are a winning combination; although Garfield made no further movies with the "East Side" gang, the studio had him re-team with both Billy Halop and Bobby Jordan, almost immediately, for "Dust Be My Destiny". The boxing scenes are nicely staged. But, the most exciting sequence has Garfield and four of the New York "Kids" (Halop, Jordan, Hall, and Punsly) climbing into a giant water tank for a swim - which unexpectedly puts their lives in danger. Other, more brief, highlights include floozy Ann Sheridan (as Goldie), boozy Barbara Pepper (as Budgie), and young Ronald Sinclair (as Douglas) losing at strip poker. ******** They Made Me a Criminal (1/21/39) Busby Berkeley ~ John Garfield, Billy Halop, Bobby Jordan, Claude Rains

    This is a poor excuse for a movie. A film noir done by Busbee Berkeley? Please! First, let's forget about the plot, a truly simple-minded version of a cynical tough guy turned into a saint by the love of a pretty blonde. Yechh. So what turns her from despising him to loving him? Along with a group of other guys, he helps keep a kid from drowning as they all swim in a water tower and try to survive as the water is siphoned off, stranding them. It isn't exactly heroics, but she's suddenly smitten. It's truly painful to watch Claude Rains trying to portray a hard-bitten, tough-talking, noir-type cop. A crooked grimace is his main and rather pathetic acting tool, along with a growling voice. Most of his energy seems to go into trying to hide the intelligence that shines in all his other roles. How he ever got talked into taking this job I'll never understand. Enjoy it, if you can, for a few period details, the old cars and gas pumps, but don't expect a decent film experience. It wasted 1-1/12 hours of my life.

    John Garfield...The "Dead End" Kids...Claude Rains...and a wrong-man-fingered theme. Not likely ingredients for director Busby Berkeley, the master of the gaudy musical showstopper. Still, this Warner Bros. remake of 1933's "The Life Of Jimmy Dolan" is satisfying on a minor scale, despite the feeling these disparate talents could have certainly come up with something more intriguing than your average "B" programmer. Prize-fighter takes the fall when his weaselly manager accidentally kills a reporter; hiding out on a date farm in Arizona, one doesn't have wait too long before the good guy tips his hand (to a morgue worker playing amateur detective!). There are interesting asides (Garfield and the Kids finding trouble while swimming in a water tank), dumb/funny ones (the Kids bilking a twelve-year-old cadet out of his clothes and movie camera), as well as excruciating scenes (all of which involve Rains' detective with his meathead boss back in New York). The romance subplot between Garfield and rancher Gloria Dickson just squeaks by, and Garfield's wise-guy cadence is tiresome to listen to (probably because it's so artificial). However, the film looks handsome enough, is given a lively pace, and the general overacting is agreeable within this context--the slim plot being so preconceived, all we have left to respond to are the characters. **1/2 from ****
