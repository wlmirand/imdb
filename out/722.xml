    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

    This movie was a huge good surprise to me. I didn't see the reviews before watching it, but just after when I decided to read more about it. This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

    This movie was a huge good surprise to me. I didn't see the reviews before watching it, but just after when I decided to read more about it. This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

    This movie was a huge good surprise to me. I didn't see the reviews before watching it, but just after when I decided to read more about it. This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?

    What is right is to produce 4 of incredibly annoying, rude, out of control brats and become the kind of people everyone find annoying because they are nothing but parents anymore. At least this is the message of this movie. This movie is all about clich&eacute; gender stereotypes which are equally insulting to both men and women. Men are the ones who act like little babies staring fights in toy stores and be all terrified about pregnancy. And women are annoying bitches with a stick up their bum who don't like fun and are incredibly baby crazy. This is all they want, babies!!! And of course if you want to have a baby you have to "grow up". This means abandon your 16 year old cat. Very disgusting to see a movie promoting such thing, treating animals as objects that can be given away whenever you don't feel like it. I know some reading this will say: "But this is just a mooooooviiiiiieeee.". Well, yes it is, and i am aware that no cat was harmed while filming it. But at the same time: how many hysterical preggos got rid of their poor pets because they watched it and got scared about a "disease". When it comes to what i discussed before: gender stereotyping. Some comedies can get away with it, when they are funny. But this one can't even be qualified as a real comedy. Way too much cheese in it to be funny. And when they get funny sometimes they go way too far and become more than a comedy but some slapstick. Which doesn't have to be bad, actually my favorite part of this movie is the trip to the hospital. But a slapstick is good when it is a slapstick, and not mainly a child promoting, non-parents shaming melodrama. I think the actors are good, but this didn't help the fact that I hated the characters and all the movie. The only exception could be Robin Williams. Can't really give this movie a good rating. A good cast and 2 scenes which I liked can't make it up for the fact that the rest of the movie was very bad.

    This is not an original movie. The story is very common and very simple: a man is told that he is going to be a father. At first, he is very ambivalent. He feels trapped into something he never wanted. But in time (of course...) he comes around, marries his girl-friend, and becomes a wonderful, loving father and husband. *yawn* It is too obvious, predictable, and simple, and that goes for the humour as well. I think it was a waste to have such a great and handsome actor as Hugh Grant in it. But still... this is a story that very many people can relate to. Lots and lots of families the world over have started just like this, with a woman who wants to become a mother, even if she has to do it all alone - and a man who is very reluctant at first. For everybody who can recognize this story from his/her own life, it can be well worth watching. Once.

    Hugh Grant, Juliane Moore could be a knocking couple for this movie, but the lines and the action makes it an average film, which respects the typical comedy story. It could be much more, but Chris Columbus (the director) didn't manage to take an ordinary story to an extraordinary extent, even though he had the material (and here i refer to the actors which are first class). I don't know what it is your opinion, but i am fed up with this kind of soft movies, made just to be made. I think a movie should be more than laughter and good time for the viewer; it should have a strong idea and make you think about the world you live in. And it definitely should not be too optimistic because life is not. I don't recommend this movie, not even if you want to laugh and have a good time. If that is what you expect from a movie than you'd better watch American Pie or other like that one, which you know from the start they don't have any hidden theme or idea to think about.

    As A Comedy It Fails, But It's Still Not A Bad Movie Overall

    This is a strange movie in a lot of ways. It's supposed to be a comedy except that it really isn't very funny, there are some issues involved with the casting and the characters, and while it's a comedy that isn't all that funny (or, for that matter, a romance that isn't all that romantic) there are parts of it that actually work reasonably well. Hugh Grant (who plays Samuel) is not someone I consider to be an "A" list actor. He's pretty one dimensional - always seeming to play variations on the same character: the lost and confused romantic, whose life just isn't working out the way he wants. As Samuel, he's a guy who has it pretty good. He's a successful child psychologist, he's living with a beautiful woman (Rebecca, played by Julianne Moore) and everything's great until the day Rebecca tells him that she's pregnant. Samuel has no dreams of being a father, and his life and relationship with Rebecca go downhill from there. The most interesting part of the movie to me was watching Samuel's evolution from a guy who was totally uninterested in fatherhood to being a guy desperate to hold on to his new family. Grant did well with the role. He didn't overwhelm - he never does; he's just not that type of actor - but he was solid. The weaknesses in this movie revolved around the comedic elements. Yes, there were some funny moments, but there weren't enough truly funny moments for this to qualify as a really solid comedy. The real problem was that the movie often tried too hard to be funny. It went way overboard. That was, in part, a problem with the cast. Tom Arnold was cast as Marty Dwyer. He and his wife meet Samuel and Rebecca at the start of the movie. His wife Gail is also having a baby, and the two couples enter into a sometimes reluctant relationship. I've never been a big fan of Arnold, and once again he grates on me a little bit here, and his character comes across as irritating rather than funny. Then there was Robin Williams as Dr. Kosevich, the obstetrician who has just arrived from Russia and has never delivered a human baby before. Williams puts on a pretty typical, slapstick Robin Williams performance in the role - but this character was way too over the top and added very little to the movie except a real feeling of total unbelievability. And yet, watching Samuel grow in his level of comfort with pending fatherhood is satisfying. He makes a difficult evolution from a character at the start of the movie for whom you have very little sympathy, to a character who becomes very sympathetic, and who you end up rooting for as he tries to put the pieces of his life back together. You expect that a degree of comedy might come from the idea that Samuel is a child psychologist who doesn't want children, but that really isn't central to the movie (and, all things considered, I can actually see why a child psychologist might not want children - after all, he's going to see all the problems!) It's just watching him grow from a guy who's part selfish and part frightened to a guy increasingly comfortable and then even enthusiastic about fatherhood. The ending is perhaps a bit sappy, but also very appropriate to the story. It's not a great comedy. If you want something to give you a lot of laughs - look elsewhere. But it's not a bad movie really, if you can get past the excesses of Arnold and Williams. (6/10)

    This movie was a huge good surprise to me. I didn't see the reviews before watching it, but just after when I decided to read more about it. This movie made me laugh and enjoy all the funniest moments and also the romantic moments in its story. I love comedies and this one is one of the funniest I ever saw. Robin Williams did a great job. And Hugh Grant cause me a great good impression in this movie. After watching him in Nothing Hill, I kinda disliked his work as actor. But he caused me a good impression with this one. I am glad I didn't read any reviews before watching the movie. So I highly encourage you to watch Nine Months and be prepared to have fun and laugh a lot.

    NINE MONTHS is about an expectant couple. To borrow a tagline from a Jeff Goldblum movie: Be afraid. Be very afraid. If the inanity doesn't kill you, the stupidity will. NINE MONTHS opens with Samuel and Rebecca (Hugh Grant and Julianne Moore) on a beach, assessing their couplehood, Samuel deciding he is happy, Rebecca intimating she is dissatisfied. (So what's new? She's a woman in a relationship - synonymous with "dissatisfied.") She speaks of her biological clock and other subjects men Do Not Hear - and we brace ourselves for a dull romantic comedy. Suddenly - Tom Arnold! With three spoiled brat kids and Joan Cusack screeching not far behind as his harridan wife. And we realize we're in for a dull, STUPID romantic comedy. Women are always complaining that men cannot know the pain of childbirth. By watching NINE MONTHS, each of us insensitive men can at last feel such pain. Based on a film written and directed by Patrick Braoud&eacute;, NEUF MOIS, Chris Columbus writes and directs NINE MONTHS like a brainless farce rooted in wrong: the wrong way to raise kids, the wrong way to behave during pregnancy, the wrong way to assess morality and the wrong way to medically process a birth (Robin Williams makes an embarrassing cameo as a Russian obstetrician who seems to have his accent confused with his asshole). Marty's (Arnold's) kids are such horrible snots that this movie shoots itself in the womb as it is trying to send the message that kids are precious. Jeff Goldblum is Sean, Samuel's best friend and sworn bachelor. And the high point of the movie - he's the B-character, but his presence is magnetic; it's like a professional has been called in to work amateurs. When he calls Marty's kids "monsters" - even though they are portrayed that way - he is regarded as perverse as a guy who turns into a human fly. When Sean describes how he dumped his girlfriend when she wanted to get pregnant, he is again painted as hilariously crazy, even though he is the most balanced character in the movie: "She chewed up my manhood, swallowed my youth... She wanted my seed, so I closed the iron door, denied her my essence!" And he left out the part about his baby being a maggot. When Rebecca falls pregnant, she tells Samuel she gets a kick out of "something living inside her." (Was she talking about Samuel's English pinewood during intercourse? Maybe she should talk to Geena Davis during that dream sequence birth.) For the record, girly, nothing is "living inside you" - your baby is a part of your metabolism. It IS you until it is birthed. If you want to talk about things living inside you with a sovereign metabolism, think about the billions of bacteria in your mouth or the bacteria that helps digest food in your villi. Got tapeworm? Why not a gerbil? Message comes through loud and stupid: Pregnant mothers are the best people in the world. The expectant father is Always Wrong. And getting to the hospital during labor is always going to be riddled with idiocy. And the sworn Monster Bachelor can't possibly be happy with a 25-year-old blond on his arm with "breasts like spongecake, calves like calzones and crazy about sex," because bachelors are men and Men Are Pigs. And though it is happening naturally in billions of organisms around the Earth, though the process of birth is no more outside the natural order of life than breathing, though there is nothing about pregnancy that defies logic or biology, whenever a women plops out an infant human being, it is somehow always - a Miracle. And then there's the other subliminal message that because the mother is pregnant, she HAS to get married to her live-in boyfriend before the birth, because heaven forfend if they're not married when the baby is born - it might be the anti-Christ or a maggot or something... Give her nine more months cleaning up vomit and cack - she'll miraculously be dissatisfied all over again.

    I can't love this movie, I can't hate it either. It just exists, and does very little more than that. As usual Hugh Grant plays Hugh Grant, but his heart doesn't really seem in it this time. He has no chemistry whatsoever with Julianne Moore, both stars seem satisfied with merely remembering their lines. They look more like brother and sister than anything else, that can't be what they were going for. Most of the fun is supposed to come from zany secondary characters, but only Robin Williams manages to really get some laughs. His scenes are the highlights of the movie, I'll let you decide whether or not that's a good thing. Just thinking of this movie sorta tires me really, it's that bland. I don't really find it bad, it just leaves me so completely indifferent, which in a way is even worse. "Nine Months" will not change anyone's life, but it's watchable when you have absolutely nothing useful to do.

    As a kid, after returning from School and wrapping up home-work, I remember watching 'Nine Months' a number of times. It was my favorite film then. Now when I look at this film, and when I think about the memories attached to it, I still kinda love it. Director Chris Columbus made my day as a kid. 'Nine Months' was not a path-breaking, $300 million rich film, nor was it liked by the pseudo critics. It was a story that wanted an audience, which fortunately it got! The entire idea of a would-be-dad freaking out to his pregnant partner is an interesting thought for a romantic-comedy. Chris Columbus's direction was good. Another aspect that worked big time in here, were it's simply weird characters. Tom Arnold & Joan Cusack were the memorable characters and performers, while Hugh Grant & Julianne Moore managed as the lead performers. Jeff Goldblum did his part well, while Robin Williams was lovable and wild as an Obstetrician and Gynaecologist. I love this film... I've got memories attached to it. But even otherwise, this is a good film, that deserves a watch.

    The title when I heard sounded like a pretty obvious premise, and with a good cast list I thought I wouldn't mind it, from director Chris Columbus (Home Alone, Mrs. Doubtfire, Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone). Basically child psychiatrist Samuel Faulkner (Hugh Grant) and ballet teacher Rebecca Taylor (Julianne Moore) have been boyfriend and girlfriend for five years, and never thought to commit to each other, i.e. marriage and kids. But things are about to change when Rebecca reveals that she is pregnant, and Samuel is panicking at the thought of being a father, but he is trying too hard to go along with what she wants. The pressures of fatherhood are made even worse with the constant irritation of encounters with the overbearing Dwyers, Marty (Tom Arnold) and also pregnant Gail (Joan Cusack), and some confusing advice from his single artist friend Sean Fletcher (Jeff Goldblum). Samuel and Rebecca go to see the doctor replacing the one they had in mind to do the delivery, the Russian and not very experienced Dr. Kosevich (Robin Williams), and this doesn't do any favours for Samuel either. When he misses another of the many scans they were meant to do together, Rebecca decides that Samuel is not involved enough in the pregnancy and knows he is not keen on the idea at all, so she leaves him. Alone, Samuel does watch the ultrasound video of his baby son growing inside his partner, at for the first time, he feels something for the new life he has created. After getting his head together, Samuel realises he loves Rebecca too much to let her go, and he finally feels confident enough to have a baby, and of course that is the point when her water breaks. A rush to the hospital causes some accidents along the way, a few people get injured and are forced to get in the car to go there as well, but they make it. They are not happy to see Dr. Kosevich again as the one to do the delivery, but as the only doctor who can, they, and the Dwyers right next to them have no choice. In the end, after the squabbles and the complaining from both the males and females, the two babies are delivered successfully, the Dwyers have another daughter, and Rebecca and Samuel are happy together with their baby son. Also starring Mia Cottet as Lili and Joey Simmrin as Truman. Just before the release Grant was caught with Hollywood prostitute Divine Brown, but I don't think it marred his career whatsoever, in this he still puts on the modern Cary Grant thing he brought to Four Weddings. Moore is reliable as Grant's pregnant other half, Arnold is a little annoying, Cusack is alright, Goldblum has his moments, and Williams makes the most as the manic obstetrician. The film is layered with some mild laughs, it has all the usual sentimental stuff involved for the baby premise, and the script could have used a tiny bit more work, not such a bad comedy. Okay!

    Depending on your comedic taste and if you like Hugh Grant you won't be disappointed by Nine Months. Ever afraid of commitment, Grant's character, Samuel, has it all - well certainly as much as he is comfortable with. With a successful practice as a child psychotherapist, pretty girlfriend (Julianne Moore), an age old cat and a Porsche, life couldn't get any more demanding. However, unbeknown to Samuel, his girlfriend Rebecca is starting to feel as though something is missing from life - a child. During a drive home one day, whereby Samuel is voicing his disapproval of modern parenting and the amount of troubled kids he has to deal with, Rebecca announces she is pregnant which causes him to crash the car in disbelief. In spite of the pregnancy being purely accidental, Samuel begins to feel like a rabbit caught in the headlights and inwardly cowers at the thought of how his perfect and self-serving existence may have to be compromised. What follows is his deceitful and feigned interest in his unborn child once it becomes evident that Rebecca wants to keep the baby. But as the pregnancy progresses his indifference becomes clear to Rebecca as he misses or turns up late for scans, protests when he is told by the doctor that his cat will have to be re-homed and that his beloved Porsche will have to be traded in for a family friendly alternative. Throw in his friend (played by Jeff Goldblum), his friend's sister, husband and three errant kids who are nothing but a harsh omen of what the future holds and both external chaos and inner turmoil ensue. Hugh Grant is a master at portraying the suppressed British buffoon and this movie is by no means an exception. Will he eventually accept he must grow up and take responsibility or will he call time on what he once cherished as a relaxed and chaos free partnership?
