    Based on the novel by Richard Bachman(Stephen King) and directed by Tom Holland, film involves an overweight lawyer(played by Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over and kills an old gypsy woman, prompting her family(led by Michael Constantine)to curse him by causing him to lose weight. At first a welcome thing, this really does become a curse when the weight loss doesn't stop, no matter how many calories he eats, which of course is highly dangerous, prompting the lawyer to beg for the curse to be removed, and when that doesn't work, takes other, more lethal measures... Bad film is devoid of suspense, interest, or point, focusing on unpleasant characters you cannot empathize with in an increasingly empty film, with a grim ending. Forget it.

    This Horror Movie can't decide what it wants to be. Gore Flick, Psychological Thriller, Black Comedy, etc. It is all over the place and never really settles in for some scares or disturbing Drama. The Acting is awful, the Script is just slightly above that, the Make-up Effects are cheesy, and the tension is virtually non-existent. It is an ugly Movie and that seems to be its intent, but it can't even pull that off because it has a candy coating like TV-Movie Production. It is all kinda slickly sick but doesn't even manage to be repulsive, just cringe-worthy. This one is for the Stephen King Fans that need to complete their checklist and only the most curious Horror Movie Cultist. It is disappointing to the extreme and the ending is very unsatisfying.

    There are a handful of King movie adaptations that are better than his books, and while this is not one of them, it stands on its own as entertaining with no cringe-worthy scenes and plot holes you can forgive. Having read the book over 20 years ago, and just now seeing the movie free on Cinemax, I have difficulty comparing the two, but I did enjoy the ending to this movie. There's no gore, but a sense of foreboding throughout. A good time killer matin&eacute;e. I went in expecting something to at least hold my attention, and I was not disappointed. The only thing that's is truly retina-killing is the fakey fat suit. Give it a rest already.

    The novel Thinner is one of my all time favorites by Stephen King. This movie is awful in every way. It stays faithful to the book in terms of the story, but it is completely trashed by a ghastly cast and horrible direction. The acting is beyond bad. Robert John Burke is a clown. The wife and daughter (no names) are plastic and completely fake. The only famous face is Joe Mantegna, but by the time he appeared in the movie I had lost interest. The makeup work is laughable. The fat suit and fat face are so poorly applied that I thought I could see the makeup lines on Burke's face. He never looks thin enough for you to believe that his life and health are in danger which is what created a lot of tension in the book. I think I can honestly say this is the worst Stephen King adaptation I have seen. There is not one redeeming quality about it. If you enjoyed the book, stay away. If you hated the book, stay away. Just stay away from it. There will be a much better B movie on a different channel that you can waste your lazy weekend on.

    Thinner (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific adaptation of the Stephen King story about an obese lawyer (Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over a gypsy and killing her. When he gets away with the crime her family puts a curse on him to make him thin. It sounds great at first but soon the lawyer starts to fade away to nothing. Tom Holland does a really good job at bringing this story to the big screen and I think he has the perfect mix of tragedy, dark humor and horror. This is a pretty amazing film to watch on a couple levels but you have to give a lot of credit to the special effects department. It's rather remarkable watching the transformation of this lawyer as he starts off at 300 pounds and then quickly melts away to basically a skeleton. I really thought every level of the effects were terrific and what really blew my mind were the shots of the lawyer's face and the way they were able to work with it to bring this rather scary story to life. The scenes of the lawyer as a skeleton were remarkable to look at and I think it helps a lot that the screenplay is so good at making you feel bad for him even if you don't agree with him getting away for what he did. The performances are another major plus with Burke doing a terrific job in the lead role. I thought he was perfect whether he was playing the overweight guy or the more tortured one as his life starts to go by him. Joe Mantegna is also good in his role as one of the lawyer's clients but I will admit that everything dealing with his character in the final act was a bit overblown. Even the cameo by King is handled pretty well. THINNER has an easy story that anyone could connect with and the questions it raises about revenge and the downfall of it are very entertaining. This here certainly ranks as one of the better horror adaptations from King and it's also worth noting how much DRAG ME TO HELL ripped off several key plot points.

    Thinner is directed by Tom Holland who co-adapts the screenplay with Michael McDowell from the novel written by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman). It stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Bethany Joy Lenz and Michael Constantine. Music is scored by Daniel Licht and cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum. When obese lawyer Billy Halleck (Burke) kills a gypsy woman by way of his careless driving, the gypsy community are stunned to see him escape punishment due to his connections. Approaching Halleck, gypsy elder Tadzu Lempke (Constantine) strokes his face and simply utters the word "thinner"......... Stephen King adaptations to the screen are many, a sure fire fact that accompanies this well mined source is that for every good one, there are ten bad ones. Thinner falls some way in between. On one hand it's a deliciously creepy premise (curse on the guilty) that's well acted and has a mean streak constantly running through it (treble doses of revenge). On the other it's a wasted opportunity to explore certain themes (gluttony, crooked law people) whilst proving dishonourable to Gypsies (they end up the baddies here!). The make up effects veer from the awful (Burke in fat suit with latex face), to the better (Burke emaciated). It is, all told, a very mixed bag of a film, a thriller more than a horror, yet always entertaining and holding the attention as we wait to see how it will pan out. With the finale very much worth waiting for. You will search in vain for someone to actually like here, and you are asked to ignore some very mixed messages. But if taken on its basic low budget thriller turns, Thinner is a decent King adaptation. 6.5/10

    I didn't know what to expect from "Thinner". Firstly when I saw it in the "What's On TV" magazine I thought of it as a serious horror film, that sounded quite eerie. You know, a man slowly getting thinner and thinner, and then of course it's Stephen King which is never a bad thing, and then it had 4 stars and so i thought that this film could have potential! But then I look at IMDb's rating and it's very below average so I was wary. Thankfully I was relieved when I turned it on and the first thing I saw was this clearly slim man in a ridiculous fat suit and I laughed. I pretty much laughed all the way through. There's no denying that "Thinner" (unintentially or not) is a very funny film. You only have to look at the man and laugh at those incredible hamster-type cheeks! The fat suit is hilariously bad, not a patch on the one that Eddie Murphey wears in "The Nutty Professor". The man's facial expressions also had me rolling down the aisles (well, 'the sitting room') in every shot his eyes were wide and gleaming like he's just seen a massive slice of cake! His smile was also hideous. He looked like "The Joker" out of "Batman". Even when he's eventually thin, he still wears those awful eyes and smile. The guy's a slug. The special make-up effects are very special indeed. A film like "Thinner" relies on the make-up effects. That's what made David Cronenberg's "The Fly" so amazing. Yet, the effects on "Thinner" are almost as bad as the fat effects. One man has terrible rubber boils over his face and his hand looks like a dinosaur stump. The 'thin' effects are also quite horrendous too. Thanks to "Thinner's" visuals you're always sure of a laugh. I can't tell if we're meant to be taking this film seriously or not. And then there's the awful screenplay that always seems to fight for the chance to see Mr.Lawyer literally stuffing his face with food. Though, it doesn't help that all the actors are terrible, with the gypsy looking like 'Grandad' out of "Mrs Brown's Boys" only with hair more luscious. Every character is a stereotype and the actor's seem to live up to that. No one asks questions like, "Why have you bought home a pie?" They just accept that and eat it. In all seriousness, "Thinner" could have been a horror classic rather than a horror cult classic. It could've been a chilling fable of greed and the price you pay for it. Instead we get a hugely entertaining film that offers no scares what so ever. "Thinner" is a hard film to rate because critically it's awful, but then again I had a ball watching this film and would happily watch it again. "Thinner" never bores, and the ending is actually pretty good. For guaranteed laughs, don't miss "Thinner".

    This is a classical Stephen King story where an unsuspecting every-day-man encounters something supernatural and scary. Through an accident that was arguably not entirely his fault, mostly not his fault, a gypsy dies and he gets cursed by the victims family. When he realizes he is cursed he tries to apologize and repent but they basically tell him to go suck it. And this is the part I find most awesome. He fights back the way I would fight back if I were put in that situation. He says he puts a curse of them. The curse of the white man from town. The curse of the white man from town involves, among other things, a mobster assassin . And highly corrosive acid of course.

    I do like Stephen King's work, but this film adaptation didn't work for me. I did like Robert John Burke(though I do think Billy Halleck, despite Burke's charisma should have been much more tortured in characterisation here), the makeup/effects which are surprisingly good and Joe Mantegna who steals every scene he's in, but that's it. The production values are alright, but there are some transitions between scenes that looked rather choppy and some of the lighting is so dim it is hard to make out what's happening in some scenes. The dialogue is fairly stupid and clunky, and the story is rather slow moving with an ending that felt reminiscent of a badly done parody of Tales from the Crypt or something or other. I think because of the slow pace and the laughable dialogue, not to mention the weak characterisation of most of the characters especially the negatively stereotyped Gypsies, there is a lack of genuine atmosphere in Thinner. Overall, just didn't work. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    Look, I was entertained for 90 minutes, long enough for a few brewskies and some popcorn, and that's all I asked of it. It's not a masterpiece. It's a simple story, simple characters... but why would you expect anything else? Just look at the DVD cover for f***'s sake. I'm baffled by the people who come on this movie's forum and are surprised by what a bad movie it was. Uh yeah, don't get me wrong, it's a RIDICULOUSLY stupid movie, but that's pretty much what I was looking for when I rented it. Had I gone into this movie without any former expectations, I would have given it 5 stars overall. The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".

    Look, I was entertained for 90 minutes, long enough for a few brewskies and some popcorn, and that's all I asked of it. It's not a masterpiece. It's a simple story, simple characters... but why would you expect anything else? Just look at the DVD cover for f***'s sake. I'm baffled by the people who come on this movie's forum and are surprised by what a bad movie it was. Uh yeah, don't get me wrong, it's a RIDICULOUSLY stupid movie, but that's pretty much what I was looking for when I rented it. Had I gone into this movie without any former expectations, I would have given it 5 stars overall. The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".

    Based on the novel by Richard Bachman(Stephen King) and directed by Tom Holland, film involves an overweight lawyer(played by Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over and kills an old gypsy woman, prompting her family(led by Michael Constantine)to curse him by causing him to lose weight. At first a welcome thing, this really does become a curse when the weight loss doesn't stop, no matter how many calories he eats, which of course is highly dangerous, prompting the lawyer to beg for the curse to be removed, and when that doesn't work, takes other, more lethal measures... Bad film is devoid of suspense, interest, or point, focusing on unpleasant characters you cannot empathize with in an increasingly empty film, with a grim ending. Forget it.

    This Horror Movie can't decide what it wants to be. Gore Flick, Psychological Thriller, Black Comedy, etc. It is all over the place and never really settles in for some scares or disturbing Drama. The Acting is awful, the Script is just slightly above that, the Make-up Effects are cheesy, and the tension is virtually non-existent. It is an ugly Movie and that seems to be its intent, but it can't even pull that off because it has a candy coating like TV-Movie Production. It is all kinda slickly sick but doesn't even manage to be repulsive, just cringe-worthy. This one is for the Stephen King Fans that need to complete their checklist and only the most curious Horror Movie Cultist. It is disappointing to the extreme and the ending is very unsatisfying.

    There are a handful of King movie adaptations that are better than his books, and while this is not one of them, it stands on its own as entertaining with no cringe-worthy scenes and plot holes you can forgive. Having read the book over 20 years ago, and just now seeing the movie free on Cinemax, I have difficulty comparing the two, but I did enjoy the ending to this movie. There's no gore, but a sense of foreboding throughout. A good time killer matin&eacute;e. I went in expecting something to at least hold my attention, and I was not disappointed. The only thing that's is truly retina-killing is the fakey fat suit. Give it a rest already.

    The novel Thinner is one of my all time favorites by Stephen King. This movie is awful in every way. It stays faithful to the book in terms of the story, but it is completely trashed by a ghastly cast and horrible direction. The acting is beyond bad. Robert John Burke is a clown. The wife and daughter (no names) are plastic and completely fake. The only famous face is Joe Mantegna, but by the time he appeared in the movie I had lost interest. The makeup work is laughable. The fat suit and fat face are so poorly applied that I thought I could see the makeup lines on Burke's face. He never looks thin enough for you to believe that his life and health are in danger which is what created a lot of tension in the book. I think I can honestly say this is the worst Stephen King adaptation I have seen. There is not one redeeming quality about it. If you enjoyed the book, stay away. If you hated the book, stay away. Just stay away from it. There will be a much better B movie on a different channel that you can waste your lazy weekend on.

    Thinner (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific adaptation of the Stephen King story about an obese lawyer (Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over a gypsy and killing her. When he gets away with the crime her family puts a curse on him to make him thin. It sounds great at first but soon the lawyer starts to fade away to nothing. Tom Holland does a really good job at bringing this story to the big screen and I think he has the perfect mix of tragedy, dark humor and horror. This is a pretty amazing film to watch on a couple levels but you have to give a lot of credit to the special effects department. It's rather remarkable watching the transformation of this lawyer as he starts off at 300 pounds and then quickly melts away to basically a skeleton. I really thought every level of the effects were terrific and what really blew my mind were the shots of the lawyer's face and the way they were able to work with it to bring this rather scary story to life. The scenes of the lawyer as a skeleton were remarkable to look at and I think it helps a lot that the screenplay is so good at making you feel bad for him even if you don't agree with him getting away for what he did. The performances are another major plus with Burke doing a terrific job in the lead role. I thought he was perfect whether he was playing the overweight guy or the more tortured one as his life starts to go by him. Joe Mantegna is also good in his role as one of the lawyer's clients but I will admit that everything dealing with his character in the final act was a bit overblown. Even the cameo by King is handled pretty well. THINNER has an easy story that anyone could connect with and the questions it raises about revenge and the downfall of it are very entertaining. This here certainly ranks as one of the better horror adaptations from King and it's also worth noting how much DRAG ME TO HELL ripped off several key plot points.

    Thinner is directed by Tom Holland who co-adapts the screenplay with Michael McDowell from the novel written by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman). It stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Bethany Joy Lenz and Michael Constantine. Music is scored by Daniel Licht and cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum. When obese lawyer Billy Halleck (Burke) kills a gypsy woman by way of his careless driving, the gypsy community are stunned to see him escape punishment due to his connections. Approaching Halleck, gypsy elder Tadzu Lempke (Constantine) strokes his face and simply utters the word "thinner"......... Stephen King adaptations to the screen are many, a sure fire fact that accompanies this well mined source is that for every good one, there are ten bad ones. Thinner falls some way in between. On one hand it's a deliciously creepy premise (curse on the guilty) that's well acted and has a mean streak constantly running through it (treble doses of revenge). On the other it's a wasted opportunity to explore certain themes (gluttony, crooked law people) whilst proving dishonourable to Gypsies (they end up the baddies here!). The make up effects veer from the awful (Burke in fat suit with latex face), to the better (Burke emaciated). It is, all told, a very mixed bag of a film, a thriller more than a horror, yet always entertaining and holding the attention as we wait to see how it will pan out. With the finale very much worth waiting for. You will search in vain for someone to actually like here, and you are asked to ignore some very mixed messages. But if taken on its basic low budget thriller turns, Thinner is a decent King adaptation. 6.5/10

    I didn't know what to expect from "Thinner". Firstly when I saw it in the "What's On TV" magazine I thought of it as a serious horror film, that sounded quite eerie. You know, a man slowly getting thinner and thinner, and then of course it's Stephen King which is never a bad thing, and then it had 4 stars and so i thought that this film could have potential! But then I look at IMDb's rating and it's very below average so I was wary. Thankfully I was relieved when I turned it on and the first thing I saw was this clearly slim man in a ridiculous fat suit and I laughed. I pretty much laughed all the way through. There's no denying that "Thinner" (unintentially or not) is a very funny film. You only have to look at the man and laugh at those incredible hamster-type cheeks! The fat suit is hilariously bad, not a patch on the one that Eddie Murphey wears in "The Nutty Professor". The man's facial expressions also had me rolling down the aisles (well, 'the sitting room') in every shot his eyes were wide and gleaming like he's just seen a massive slice of cake! His smile was also hideous. He looked like "The Joker" out of "Batman". Even when he's eventually thin, he still wears those awful eyes and smile. The guy's a slug. The special make-up effects are very special indeed. A film like "Thinner" relies on the make-up effects. That's what made David Cronenberg's "The Fly" so amazing. Yet, the effects on "Thinner" are almost as bad as the fat effects. One man has terrible rubber boils over his face and his hand looks like a dinosaur stump. The 'thin' effects are also quite horrendous too. Thanks to "Thinner's" visuals you're always sure of a laugh. I can't tell if we're meant to be taking this film seriously or not. And then there's the awful screenplay that always seems to fight for the chance to see Mr.Lawyer literally stuffing his face with food. Though, it doesn't help that all the actors are terrible, with the gypsy looking like 'Grandad' out of "Mrs Brown's Boys" only with hair more luscious. Every character is a stereotype and the actor's seem to live up to that. No one asks questions like, "Why have you bought home a pie?" They just accept that and eat it. In all seriousness, "Thinner" could have been a horror classic rather than a horror cult classic. It could've been a chilling fable of greed and the price you pay for it. Instead we get a hugely entertaining film that offers no scares what so ever. "Thinner" is a hard film to rate because critically it's awful, but then again I had a ball watching this film and would happily watch it again. "Thinner" never bores, and the ending is actually pretty good. For guaranteed laughs, don't miss "Thinner".

    This is a classical Stephen King story where an unsuspecting every-day-man encounters something supernatural and scary. Through an accident that was arguably not entirely his fault, mostly not his fault, a gypsy dies and he gets cursed by the victims family. When he realizes he is cursed he tries to apologize and repent but they basically tell him to go suck it. And this is the part I find most awesome. He fights back the way I would fight back if I were put in that situation. He says he puts a curse of them. The curse of the white man from town. The curse of the white man from town involves, among other things, a mobster assassin . And highly corrosive acid of course.

    I do like Stephen King's work, but this film adaptation didn't work for me. I did like Robert John Burke(though I do think Billy Halleck, despite Burke's charisma should have been much more tortured in characterisation here), the makeup/effects which are surprisingly good and Joe Mantegna who steals every scene he's in, but that's it. The production values are alright, but there are some transitions between scenes that looked rather choppy and some of the lighting is so dim it is hard to make out what's happening in some scenes. The dialogue is fairly stupid and clunky, and the story is rather slow moving with an ending that felt reminiscent of a badly done parody of Tales from the Crypt or something or other. I think because of the slow pace and the laughable dialogue, not to mention the weak characterisation of most of the characters especially the negatively stereotyped Gypsies, there is a lack of genuine atmosphere in Thinner. Overall, just didn't work. 3/10 Bethany Cox

It's a simple story, simple characters... but why would you expect anything else? Just look at the DVD cover for f***'s sake. I'm baffled by the people who come on this movie's forum and are surprised by what a bad movie it was. Uh yeah, don't get me wrong, it's a RIDICULOUSLY stupid movie, but that's pretty much what I was looking for when I rented it. Had I gone into this movie without any former expectations, I would have given it 5 stars overall. The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".

    Based on the novel by Richard Bachman(Stephen King) and directed by Tom Holland, film involves an overweight lawyer(played by Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over and kills an old gypsy woman, prompting her family(led by Michael Constantine)to curse him by causing him to lose weight. At first a welcome thing, this really does become a curse when the weight loss doesn't stop, no matter how many calories he eats, which of course is highly dangerous, prompting the lawyer to beg for the curse to be removed, and when that doesn't work, takes other, more lethal measures... Bad film is devoid of suspense, interest, or point, focusing on unpleasant characters you cannot empathize with in an increasingly empty film, with a grim ending. Forget it.

    This Horror Movie can't decide what it wants to be. Gore Flick, Psychological Thriller, Black Comedy, etc. It is all over the place and never really settles in for some scares or disturbing Drama. The Acting is awful, the Script is just slightly above that, the Make-up Effects are cheesy, and the tension is virtually non-existent. It is an ugly Movie and that seems to be its intent, but it can't even pull that off because it has a candy coating like TV-Movie Production. It is all kinda slickly sick but doesn't even manage to be repulsive, just cringe-worthy. This one is for the Stephen King Fans that need to complete their checklist and only the most curious Horror Movie Cultist. It is disappointing to the extreme and the ending is very unsatisfying.

    There are a handful of King movie adaptations that are better than his books, and while this is not one of them, it stands on its own as entertaining with no cringe-worthy scenes and plot holes you can forgive. Having read the book over 20 years ago, and just now seeing the movie free on Cinemax, I have difficulty comparing the two, but I did enjoy the ending to this movie. There's no gore, but a sense of foreboding throughout. A good time killer matin&eacute;e. I went in expecting something to at least hold my attention, and I was not disappointed. The only thing that's is truly retina-killing is the fakey fat suit. Give it a rest already.

    The novel Thinner is one of my all time favorites by Stephen King. This movie is awful in every way. It stays faithful to the book in terms of the story, but it is completely trashed by a ghastly cast and horrible direction. The acting is beyond bad. Robert John Burke is a clown. The wife and daughter (no names) are plastic and completely fake. The only famous face is Joe Mantegna, but by the time he appeared in the movie I had lost interest. The makeup work is laughable. The fat suit and fat face are so poorly applied that I thought I could see the makeup lines on Burke's face. He never looks thin enough for you to believe that his life and health are in danger which is what created a lot of tension in the book. I think I can honestly say this is the worst Stephen King adaptation I have seen. There is not one redeeming quality about it. If you enjoyed the book, stay away. If you hated the book, stay away. Just stay away from it. There will be a much better B movie on a different channel that you can waste your lazy weekend on.

    Thinner (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific adaptation of the Stephen King story about an obese lawyer (Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over a gypsy and killing her. When he gets away with the crime her family puts a curse on him to make him thin. It sounds great at first but soon the lawyer starts to fade away to nothing. Tom Holland does a really good job at bringing this story to the big screen and I think he has the perfect mix of tragedy, dark humor and horror. This is a pretty amazing film to watch on a couple levels but you have to give a lot of credit to the special effects department. It's rather remarkable watching the transformation of this lawyer as he starts off at 300 pounds and then quickly melts away to basically a skeleton. I really thought every level of the effects were terrific and what really blew my mind were the shots of the lawyer's face and the way they were able to work with it to bring this rather scary story to life. The scenes of the lawyer as a skeleton were remarkable to look at and I think it helps a lot that the screenplay is so good at making you feel bad for him even if you don't agree with him getting away for what he did. The performances are another major plus with Burke doing a terrific job in the lead role. I thought he was perfect whether he was playing the overweight guy or the more tortured one as his life starts to go by him. Joe Mantegna is also good in his role as one of the lawyer's clients but I will admit that everything dealing with his character in the final act was a bit overblown. Even the cameo by King is handled pretty well. THINNER has an easy story that anyone could connect with and the questions it raises about revenge and the downfall of it are very entertaining. This here certainly ranks as one of the better horror adaptations from King and it's also worth noting how much DRAG ME TO HELL ripped off several key plot points.

    Thinner is directed by Tom Holland who co-adapts the screenplay with Michael McDowell from the novel written by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman). It stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Bethany Joy Lenz and Michael Constantine. Music is scored by Daniel Licht and cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum. When obese lawyer Billy Halleck (Burke) kills a gypsy woman by way of his careless driving, the gypsy community are stunned to see him escape punishment due to his connections. Approaching Halleck, gypsy elder Tadzu Lempke (Constantine) strokes his face and simply utters the word "thinner"......... Stephen King adaptations to the screen are many, a sure fire fact that accompanies this well mined source is that for every good one, there are ten bad ones. Thinner falls some way in between. On one hand it's a deliciously creepy premise (curse on the guilty) that's well acted and has a mean streak constantly running through it (treble doses of revenge). On the other it's a wasted opportunity to explore certain themes (gluttony, crooked law people) whilst proving dishonourable to Gypsies (they end up the baddies here!). The make up effects veer from the awful (Burke in fat suit with latex face), to the better (Burke emaciated). It is, all told, a very mixed bag of a film, a thriller more than a horror, yet always entertaining and holding the attention as we wait to see how it will pan out. With the finale very much worth waiting for. You will search in vain for someone to actually like here, and you are asked to ignore some very mixed messages. But if taken on its basic low budget thriller turns, Thinner is a decent King adaptation. 6.5/10

    I didn't know what to expect from "Thinner". Firstly when I saw it in the "What's On TV" magazine I thought of it as a serious horror film, that sounded quite eerie. You know, a man slowly getting thinner and thinner, and then of course it's Stephen King which is never a bad thing, and then it had 4 stars and so i thought that this film could have potential! But then I look at IMDb's rating and it's very below average so I was wary. Thankfully I was relieved when I turned it on and the first thing I saw was this clearly slim man in a ridiculous fat suit and I laughed. I pretty much laughed all the way through. There's no denying that "Thinner" (unintentially or not) is a very funny film. You only have to look at the man and laugh at those incredible hamster-type cheeks! The fat suit is hilariously bad, not a patch on the one that Eddie Murphey wears in "The Nutty Professor". The man's facial expressions also had me rolling down the aisles (well, 'the sitting room') in every shot his eyes were wide and gleaming like he's just seen a massive slice of cake! His smile was also hideous. He looked like "The Joker" out of "Batman". Even when he's eventually thin, he still wears those awful eyes and smile. The guy's a slug. The special make-up effects are very special indeed. A film like "Thinner" relies on the make-up effects. That's what made David Cronenberg's "The Fly" so amazing. Yet, the effects on "Thinner" are almost as bad as the fat effects. One man has terrible rubber boils over his face and his hand looks like a dinosaur stump. The 'thin' effects are also quite horrendous too. Thanks to "Thinner's" visuals you're always sure of a laugh. I can't tell if we're meant to be taking this film seriously or not. And then there's the awful screenplay that always seems to fight for the chance to see Mr.Lawyer literally stuffing his face with food. Though, it doesn't help that all the actors are terrible, with the gypsy looking like 'Grandad' out of "Mrs Brown's Boys" only with hair more luscious. Every character is a stereotype and the actor's seem to live up to that. No one asks questions like, "Why have you bought home a pie?" They just accept that and eat it. In all seriousness, "Thinner" could have been a horror classic rather than a horror cult classic. It could've been a chilling fable of greed and the price you pay for it. Instead we get a hugely entertaining film that offers no scares what so ever. "Thinner" is a hard film to rate because critically it's awful, but then again I had a ball watching this film and would happily watch it again. "Thinner" never bores, and the ending is actually pretty good. For guaranteed laughs, don't miss "Thinner".

    This is a classical Stephen King story where an unsuspecting every-day-man encounters something supernatural and scary. Through an accident that was arguably not entirely his fault, mostly not his fault, a gypsy dies and he gets cursed by the victims family. When he realizes he is cursed he tries to apologize and repent but they basically tell him to go suck it. And this is the part I find most awesome. He fights back the way I would fight back if I were put in that situation. He says he puts a curse of them. The curse of the white man from town. The curse of the white man from town involves, among other things, a mobster assassin . And highly corrosive acid of course.

    I do like Stephen King's work, but this film adaptation didn't work for me. I did like Robert John Burke(though I do think Billy Halleck, despite Burke's charisma should have been much more tortured in characterisation here), the makeup/effects which are surprisingly good and Joe Mantegna who steals every scene he's in, but that's it. The production values are alright, but there are some transitions between scenes that looked rather choppy and some of the lighting is so dim it is hard to make out what's happening in some scenes. The dialogue is fairly stupid and clunky, and the story is rather slow moving with an ending that felt reminiscent of a badly done parody of Tales from the Crypt or something or other. I think because of the slow pace and the laughable dialogue, not to mention the weak characterisation of most of the characters especially the negatively stereotyped Gypsies, there is a lack of genuine atmosphere in Thinner. Overall, just didn't work. 3/10 Bethany Cox

Uh yeah, don't get me wrong, it's a RIDICULOUSLY stupid movie, but that's pretty much what I was looking for when I rented it. Had I gone into this movie without any former expectations, I would have given it 5 stars overall. The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".

    Based on the novel by Richard Bachman(Stephen King) and directed by Tom Holland, film involves an overweight lawyer(played by Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over and kills an old gypsy woman, prompting her family(led by Michael Constantine)to curse him by causing him to lose weight. At first a welcome thing, this really does become a curse when the weight loss doesn't stop, no matter how many calories he eats, which of course is highly dangerous, prompting the lawyer to beg for the curse to be removed, and when that doesn't work, takes other, more lethal measures... Bad film is devoid of suspense, interest, or point, focusing on unpleasant characters you cannot empathize with in an increasingly empty film, with a grim ending. Forget it.

    This Horror Movie can't decide what it wants to be. Gore Flick, Psychological Thriller, Black Comedy, etc. It is all over the place and never really settles in for some scares or disturbing Drama. The Acting is awful, the Script is just slightly above that, the Make-up Effects are cheesy, and the tension is virtually non-existent. It is an ugly Movie and that seems to be its intent, but it can't even pull that off because it has a candy coating like TV-Movie Production. It is all kinda slickly sick but doesn't even manage to be repulsive, just cringe-worthy. This one is for the Stephen King Fans that need to complete their checklist and only the most curious Horror Movie Cultist. It is disappointing to the extreme and the ending is very unsatisfying.

    There are a handful of King movie adaptations that are better than his books, and while this is not one of them, it stands on its own as entertaining with no cringe-worthy scenes and plot holes you can forgive. Having read the book over 20 years ago, and just now seeing the movie free on Cinemax, I have difficulty comparing the two, but I did enjoy the ending to this movie. There's no gore, but a sense of foreboding throughout. A good time killer matin&eacute;e. I went in expecting something to at least hold my attention, and I was not disappointed. The only thing that's is truly retina-killing is the fakey fat suit. Give it a rest already.

    The novel Thinner is one of my all time favorites by Stephen King. This movie is awful in every way. It stays faithful to the book in terms of the story, but it is completely trashed by a ghastly cast and horrible direction. The acting is beyond bad. Robert John Burke is a clown. The wife and daughter (no names) are plastic and completely fake. The only famous face is Joe Mantegna, but by the time he appeared in the movie I had lost interest. The makeup work is laughable. The fat suit and fat face are so poorly applied that I thought I could see the makeup lines on Burke's face. He never looks thin enough for you to believe that his life and health are in danger which is what created a lot of tension in the book. I think I can honestly say this is the worst Stephen King adaptation I have seen. There is not one redeeming quality about it. If you enjoyed the book, stay away. If you hated the book, stay away. Just stay away from it. There will be a much better B movie on a different channel that you can waste your lazy weekend on.

    Thinner (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific adaptation of the Stephen King story about an obese lawyer (Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over a gypsy and killing her. When he gets away with the crime her family puts a curse on him to make him thin. It sounds great at first but soon the lawyer starts to fade away to nothing. Tom Holland does a really good job at bringing this story to the big screen and I think he has the perfect mix of tragedy, dark humor and horror. This is a pretty amazing film to watch on a couple levels but you have to give a lot of credit to the special effects department. It's rather remarkable watching the transformation of this lawyer as he starts off at 300 pounds and then quickly melts away to basically a skeleton. I really thought every level of the effects were terrific and what really blew my mind were the shots of the lawyer's face and the way they were able to work with it to bring this rather scary story to life. The scenes of the lawyer as a skeleton were remarkable to look at and I think it helps a lot that the screenplay is so good at making you feel bad for him even if you don't agree with him getting away for what he did. The performances are another major plus with Burke doing a terrific job in the lead role. I thought he was perfect whether he was playing the overweight guy or the more tortured one as his life starts to go by him. Joe Mantegna is also good in his role as one of the lawyer's clients but I will admit that everything dealing with his character in the final act was a bit overblown. Even the cameo by King is handled pretty well. THINNER has an easy story that anyone could connect with and the questions it raises about revenge and the downfall of it are very entertaining. This here certainly ranks as one of the better horror adaptations from King and it's also worth noting how much DRAG ME TO HELL ripped off several key plot points.

    Thinner is directed by Tom Holland who co-adapts the screenplay with Michael McDowell from the novel written by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman). It stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Bethany Joy Lenz and Michael Constantine. Music is scored by Daniel Licht and cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum. When obese lawyer Billy Halleck (Burke) kills a gypsy woman by way of his careless driving, the gypsy community are stunned to see him escape punishment due to his connections. Approaching Halleck, gypsy elder Tadzu Lempke (Constantine) strokes his face and simply utters the word "thinner"......... Stephen King adaptations to the screen are many, a sure fire fact that accompanies this well mined source is that for every good one, there are ten bad ones. Thinner falls some way in between. On one hand it's a deliciously creepy premise (curse on the guilty) that's well acted and has a mean streak constantly running through it (treble doses of revenge). On the other it's a wasted opportunity to explore certain themes (gluttony, crooked law people) whilst proving dishonourable to Gypsies (they end up the baddies here!). The make up effects veer from the awful (Burke in fat suit with latex face), to the better (Burke emaciated). It is, all told, a very mixed bag of a film, a thriller more than a horror, yet always entertaining and holding the attention as we wait to see how it will pan out. With the finale very much worth waiting for. You will search in vain for someone to actually like here, and you are asked to ignore some very mixed messages. But if taken on its basic low budget thriller turns, Thinner is a decent King adaptation. 6.5/10

    I didn't know what to expect from "Thinner". Firstly when I saw it in the "What's On TV" magazine I thought of it as a serious horror film, that sounded quite eerie. You know, a man slowly getting thinner and thinner, and then of course it's Stephen King which is never a bad thing, and then it had 4 stars and so i thought that this film could have potential! But then I look at IMDb's rating and it's very below average so I was wary. Thankfully I was relieved when I turned it on and the first thing I saw was this clearly slim man in a ridiculous fat suit and I laughed. I pretty much laughed all the way through. There's no denying that "Thinner" (unintentially or not) is a very funny film. You only have to look at the man and laugh at those incredible hamster-type cheeks! The fat suit is hilariously bad, not a patch on the one that Eddie Murphey wears in "The Nutty Professor". The man's facial expressions also had me rolling down the aisles (well, 'the sitting room') in every shot his eyes were wide and gleaming like he's just seen a massive slice of cake! His smile was also hideous. He looked like "The Joker" out of "Batman". Even when he's eventually thin, he still wears those awful eyes and smile. The guy's a slug. The special make-up effects are very special indeed. A film like "Thinner" relies on the make-up effects. That's what made David Cronenberg's "The Fly" so amazing. Yet, the effects on "Thinner" are almost as bad as the fat effects. One man has terrible rubber boils over his face and his hand looks like a dinosaur stump. The 'thin' effects are also quite horrendous too. Thanks to "Thinner's" visuals you're always sure of a laugh. I can't tell if we're meant to be taking this film seriously or not. And then there's the awful screenplay that always seems to fight for the chance to see Mr.Lawyer literally stuffing his face with food. Though, it doesn't help that all the actors are terrible, with the gypsy looking like 'Grandad' out of "Mrs Brown's Boys" only with hair more luscious. Every character is a stereotype and the actor's seem to live up to that. No one asks questions like, "Why have you bought home a pie?" They just accept that and eat it. In all seriousness, "Thinner" could have been a horror classic rather than a horror cult classic. It could've been a chilling fable of greed and the price you pay for it. Instead we get a hugely entertaining film that offers no scares what so ever. "Thinner" is a hard film to rate because critically it's awful, but then again I had a ball watching this film and would happily watch it again. "Thinner" never bores, and the ending is actually pretty good. For guaranteed laughs, don't miss "Thinner".

    This is a classical Stephen King story where an unsuspecting every-day-man encounters something supernatural and scary. Through an accident that was arguably not entirely his fault, mostly not his fault, a gypsy dies and he gets cursed by the victims family. When he realizes he is cursed he tries to apologize and repent but they basically tell him to go suck it. And this is the part I find most awesome. He fights back the way I would fight back if I were put in that situation. He says he puts a curse of them. The curse of the white man from town. The curse of the white man from town involves, among other things, a mobster assassin . And highly corrosive acid of course.

    I do like Stephen King's work, but this film adaptation didn't work for me. I did like Robert John Burke(though I do think Billy Halleck, despite Burke's charisma should have been much more tortured in characterisation here), the makeup/effects which are surprisingly good and Joe Mantegna who steals every scene he's in, but that's it. The production values are alright, but there are some transitions between scenes that looked rather choppy and some of the lighting is so dim it is hard to make out what's happening in some scenes. The dialogue is fairly stupid and clunky, and the story is rather slow moving with an ending that felt reminiscent of a badly done parody of Tales from the Crypt or something or other. I think because of the slow pace and the laughable dialogue, not to mention the weak characterisation of most of the characters especially the negatively stereotyped Gypsies, there is a lack of genuine atmosphere in Thinner. Overall, just didn't work. 3/10 Bethany Cox

The acting was way over the top, the directing not so great, and the writing wasn't spectacular either. However, the story was moderately clever, and it gets points for keeping a fairly tongue-in-cheek humor about it; at no point did I feel like it was trying to take itself seriously. I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".

    Based on the novel by Richard Bachman(Stephen King) and directed by Tom Holland, film involves an overweight lawyer(played by Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over and kills an old gypsy woman, prompting her family(led by Michael Constantine)to curse him by causing him to lose weight. At first a welcome thing, this really does become a curse when the weight loss doesn't stop, no matter how many calories he eats, which of course is highly dangerous, prompting the lawyer to beg for the curse to be removed, and when that doesn't work, takes other, more lethal measures... Bad film is devoid of suspense, interest, or point, focusing on unpleasant characters you cannot empathize with in an increasingly empty film, with a grim ending. Forget it.

    This Horror Movie can't decide what it wants to be. Gore Flick, Psychological Thriller, Black Comedy, etc. It is all over the place and never really settles in for some scares or disturbing Drama. The Acting is awful, the Script is just slightly above that, the Make-up Effects are cheesy, and the tension is virtually non-existent. It is an ugly Movie and that seems to be its intent, but it can't even pull that off because it has a candy coating like TV-Movie Production. It is all kinda slickly sick but doesn't even manage to be repulsive, just cringe-worthy. This one is for the Stephen King Fans that need to complete their checklist and only the most curious Horror Movie Cultist. It is disappointing to the extreme and the ending is very unsatisfying.

    There are a handful of King movie adaptations that are better than his books, and while this is not one of them, it stands on its own as entertaining with no cringe-worthy scenes and plot holes you can forgive. Having read the book over 20 years ago, and just now seeing the movie free on Cinemax, I have difficulty comparing the two, but I did enjoy the ending to this movie. There's no gore, but a sense of foreboding throughout. A good time killer matin&eacute;e. I went in expecting something to at least hold my attention, and I was not disappointed. The only thing that's is truly retina-killing is the fakey fat suit. Give it a rest already.

    The novel Thinner is one of my all time favorites by Stephen King. This movie is awful in every way. It stays faithful to the book in terms of the story, but it is completely trashed by a ghastly cast and horrible direction. The acting is beyond bad. Robert John Burke is a clown. The wife and daughter (no names) are plastic and completely fake. The only famous face is Joe Mantegna, but by the time he appeared in the movie I had lost interest. The makeup work is laughable. The fat suit and fat face are so poorly applied that I thought I could see the makeup lines on Burke's face. He never looks thin enough for you to believe that his life and health are in danger which is what created a lot of tension in the book. I think I can honestly say this is the worst Stephen King adaptation I have seen. There is not one redeeming quality about it. If you enjoyed the book, stay away. If you hated the book, stay away. Just stay away from it. There will be a much better B movie on a different channel that you can waste your lazy weekend on.

    Thinner (1996) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Terrific adaptation of the Stephen King story about an obese lawyer (Robert John Burke) who accidentally runs over a gypsy and killing her. When he gets away with the crime her family puts a curse on him to make him thin. It sounds great at first but soon the lawyer starts to fade away to nothing. Tom Holland does a really good job at bringing this story to the big screen and I think he has the perfect mix of tragedy, dark humor and horror. This is a pretty amazing film to watch on a couple levels but you have to give a lot of credit to the special effects department. It's rather remarkable watching the transformation of this lawyer as he starts off at 300 pounds and then quickly melts away to basically a skeleton. I really thought every level of the effects were terrific and what really blew my mind were the shots of the lawyer's face and the way they were able to work with it to bring this rather scary story to life. The scenes of the lawyer as a skeleton were remarkable to look at and I think it helps a lot that the screenplay is so good at making you feel bad for him even if you don't agree with him getting away for what he did. The performances are another major plus with Burke doing a terrific job in the lead role. I thought he was perfect whether he was playing the overweight guy or the more tortured one as his life starts to go by him. Joe Mantegna is also good in his role as one of the lawyer's clients but I will admit that everything dealing with his character in the final act was a bit overblown. Even the cameo by King is handled pretty well. THINNER has an easy story that anyone could connect with and the questions it raises about revenge and the downfall of it are very entertaining. This here certainly ranks as one of the better horror adaptations from King and it's also worth noting how much DRAG ME TO HELL ripped off several key plot points.

    Thinner is directed by Tom Holland who co-adapts the screenplay with Michael McDowell from the novel written by Stephen King (as Richard Bachman). It stars Robert John Burke, Joe Mantegna, Lucinda Jenney, Bethany Joy Lenz and Michael Constantine. Music is scored by Daniel Licht and cinematography by Kees Van Oostrum. When obese lawyer Billy Halleck (Burke) kills a gypsy woman by way of his careless driving, the gypsy community are stunned to see him escape punishment due to his connections. Approaching Halleck, gypsy elder Tadzu Lempke (Constantine) strokes his face and simply utters the word "thinner"......... Stephen King adaptations to the screen are many, a sure fire fact that accompanies this well mined source is that for every good one, there are ten bad ones. Thinner falls some way in between. On one hand it's a deliciously creepy premise (curse on the guilty) that's well acted and has a mean streak constantly running through it (treble doses of revenge). On the other it's a wasted opportunity to explore certain themes (gluttony, crooked law people) whilst proving dishonourable to Gypsies (they end up the baddies here!). The make up effects veer from the awful (Burke in fat suit with latex face), to the better (Burke emaciated). It is, all told, a very mixed bag of a film, a thriller more than a horror, yet always entertaining and holding the attention as we wait to see how it will pan out. With the finale very much worth waiting for. You will search in vain for someone to actually like here, and you are asked to ignore some very mixed messages. But if taken on its basic low budget thriller turns, Thinner is a decent King adaptation. 6.5/10

    I didn't know what to expect from "Thinner". Firstly when I saw it in the "What's On TV" magazine I thought of it as a serious horror film, that sounded quite eerie. You know, a man slowly getting thinner and thinner, and then of course it's Stephen King which is never a bad thing, and then it had 4 stars and so i thought that this film could have potential! But then I look at IMDb's rating and it's very below average so I was wary. Thankfully I was relieved when I turned it on and the first thing I saw was this clearly slim man in a ridiculous fat suit and I laughed. I pretty much laughed all the way through. There's no denying that "Thinner" (unintentially or not) is a very funny film. You only have to look at the man and laugh at those incredible hamster-type cheeks! The fat suit is hilariously bad, not a patch on the one that Eddie Murphey wears in "The Nutty Professor". The man's facial expressions also had me rolling down the aisles (well, 'the sitting room') in every shot his eyes were wide and gleaming like he's just seen a massive slice of cake! His smile was also hideous. He looked like "The Joker" out of "Batman". Even when he's eventually thin, he still wears those awful eyes and smile. The guy's a slug. The special make-up effects are very special indeed. A film like "Thinner" relies on the make-up effects. That's what made David Cronenberg's "The Fly" so amazing. Yet, the effects on "Thinner" are almost as bad as the fat effects. One man has terrible rubber boils over his face and his hand looks like a dinosaur stump. The 'thin' effects are also quite horrendous too. Thanks to "Thinner's" visuals you're always sure of a laugh. I can't tell if we're meant to be taking this film seriously or not. And then there's the awful screenplay that always seems to fight for the chance to see Mr.Lawyer literally stuffing his face with food. Though, it doesn't help that all the actors are terrible, with the gypsy looking like 'Grandad' out of "Mrs Brown's Boys" only with hair more luscious. Every character is a stereotype and the actor's seem to live up to that. No one asks questions like, "Why have you bought home a pie?" They just accept that and eat it. In all seriousness, "Thinner" could have been a horror classic rather than a horror cult classic. It could've been a chilling fable of greed and the price you pay for it. Instead we get a hugely entertaining film that offers no scares what so ever. "Thinner" is a hard film to rate because critically it's awful, but then again I had a ball watching this film and would happily watch it again. "Thinner" never bores, and the ending is actually pretty good. For guaranteed laughs, don't miss "Thinner".

    This is a classical Stephen King story where an unsuspecting every-day-man encounters something supernatural and scary. Through an accident that was arguably not entirely his fault, mostly not his fault, a gypsy dies and he gets cursed by the victims family. When he realizes he is cursed he tries to apologize and repent but they basically tell him to go suck it. And this is the part I find most awesome. He fights back the way I would fight back if I were put in that situation. He says he puts a curse of them. The curse of the white man from town. The curse of the white man from town involves, among other things, a mobster assassin . And highly corrosive acid of course.

    I do like Stephen King's work, but this film adaptation didn't work for me. I did like Robert John Burke(though I do think Billy Halleck, despite Burke's charisma should have been much more tortured in characterisation here), the makeup/effects which are surprisingly good and Joe Mantegna who steals every scene he's in, but that's it. The production values are alright, but there are some transitions between scenes that looked rather choppy and some of the lighting is so dim it is hard to make out what's happening in some scenes. The dialogue is fairly stupid and clunky, and the story is rather slow moving with an ending that felt reminiscent of a badly done parody of Tales from the Crypt or something or other. I think because of the slow pace and the laughable dialogue, not to mention the weak characterisation of most of the characters especially the negatively stereotyped Gypsies, there is a lack of genuine atmosphere in Thinner. Overall, just didn't work. 3/10 Bethany Cox

    Look, I was entertained for 90 minutes, long enough for a few brewskies and some popcorn, and that's all I asked of it. It's not a masterpiece. It's a simple story, simple characters... but why would you expect anything else? Just look at the DVD cover for f***'s sake.

I give it another star based entirely off the strength of it's makeup effects (yes, they're that good, considering it was made in a time before digital makeup). Finally, I give it 7 stars, simply because it met my expectations as a cheesy, over-the-top, horror romp, and I would've expected nothing less from "Stephen King's Thinner".
