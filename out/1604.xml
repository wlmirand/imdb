    This isn't real noir by my definition which is ruled by hallucinative memory, seduction and amused fate. But others define noir as a style, in which case this does have the shadows. It's from that genealogy of noir with roots in westerns and gangster movies with its purer landscape, crisper asphalt and desert god. Viewers who want simple and efficient world mechanics will find this to their taste, no frills here. Supposedly it's just the facts. But if you look at the cinematic facts of the movie? An omniscient Filekeeper narrates. None of the cops is distinguishable as a distinct human being. And no one does anything that doesn't serve the narrated facts on file.. Crushing. It isn't alone that times have changed, though we have since seen this template countless times on TV. It isn't even that the film is populated by simple folks, mostly cops, or the case is exceedingly simple, which it is. The Naked City of the same year takes a similar 'factual' approach but doesn't feel so stolid. It may altogether be that we're hardwired to much faster thinking and simultaneously a more nuanced 'real' behavior. It probably just comes down to stiff acting and script. I was amused by a scene where the police commissioner has gathered all the witnesses in a room to help profile a picture of the suspect. Needless to say the picture turns out exactly like our guy. But watch them as they fill in the detail, the cadence, the observations, the clean delivery. It's like you've gone into a bar where everyone has been told to pretend that he's in a bar. Still, remarkable LA. In spite of everything, I might include it in my Los Angeles project. Noir Meter: 1/4

    Richard Basehart is chilling as a radio operator-turned rogue in this noir that is literally cloaked in shadows. Rather than be caught with lock-picking tools, Roy pumps a patrolman full of lead. The cop tries valiantly to fight back and a whole detail of gumshoes work the streets of LA to find this reptilian thief. The cops use a mild-mannered businessman as the bait to catch Roy, leaving him woefully vulnerable to injury or worse. Basehart is chilling in a couple of claustrophobic scenes with the sap. Basehart gets milk deliveries to feed his poor dog, and that turns out to be his undoing. The film ends jarringly abruptly, like the victim's life. Grim, harsh, and powerful.

    *Spoiler/plot- He walks the Night, 1948. A clever young criminal uses his electronic knowledge to steal and re-sell home electronic items during the early TV and radio age in Los Angeles. He is ruthless and shoots two police officers that are chasing him. The crook uses the extensive underground flood control system to keep ahead of the police. After a chase and gunfight, he is killed there. *Special Stars- Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell, Jack Webb. *Theme- Good honorable police enforcement often helps justice along the way. *Trivia/location/goofs- B & W, Film noir, Los Angeles. Semi-documentary style with narrator. Mr. Basehart had very little dialog(film voice over narrator did most of the plot exposition) but a lot of acting in this first film for him . The LAPD technical adviser talked to Jack Webb and this project became the basis for the Dragnet radio show which turned into a TV show. *Emotion- Gritty, raw, action packed, 'film noir' stark shadows across the principle characters in scenes, very little flowery dialog and raw semi-documentary shooting style make this film the granddaddy of many latter decades police dramas. The best of these film makes the viewer a participant. If you're a fan of detective film noir(like me), you'll enjoy this movie. Non-fans will find this film full of trivial faults. I did not.

    "He Walked By Night" is a low budget crime drama which tells the true story of an exceptionally resourceful cop killer and the way in which he was pursued by the LAPD. The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax. In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow. Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet. The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible. Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words. It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show "Dragnet" which also emphasised the value of methodical police work. "He Walked By Night" looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

    ***SPOILERS*** Semidocumentary style Film Nior classic that's a lot like the film "Street with no Name" released in the same year. "He Walked by Night" is based on the real life crimes of former L.A police department employee and WWII vet Erwin "Mechine-Gun" Walker who terrorized the city in the mid 1940's with a string of shootings and armed robberies. Roy Martin, Richard Besehart, has been burglarizing electrical appliances stores in L.A and pretending that what he stole he in fact invented. Martin makes a living, and a damn good one at that, by selling his stolen booty to his fence-man, who in fact doesn't known it's stolen property, electronic dealer Paul Reeves, Whit Bissell. It's when Martin is spotted by an LAPD cop one night hanging around an electronic store and looking like he's up to no good that he gunned him down thus going up the ladder in the world of crime from just a plain garden variety burglar to a wanted all points, in the state, cop killer! With every cop in the LAPD out looking for him Martin is able to avoid them in slipping into the vast 700 mile L.A sewer system thus preventing him from being captured. Despite all the precautions he takes Martin makes the mistake of going back to his "Fence-Man" Paul Reeves to make sure, by bashing his skull in and cracking a couple of his ribs, that he doesn't turn him into the police. That tips the cops on the case Sgt. Marty Brennan, Scott Brady,& Sgt. Chuck Jones,James Cardwell, off to Martin's identity. That's not after Jones ended up being brutally attacked and beaten by Martin when he spotted him and his partner Sgt. Brennan hiding out in Reeves' office. ***SPOILERS*** With his cover blown thanks to the US Post Office in tracking him down in this out of the way L.A bungalow colony Martin is now not only on the run but has his secret hideout, the sewer system, found out as well. Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

    Fascinating film. It surely inspired the video game LA Noire. Many of the sights in the game are seen in this film, eg the library. There are several shots of Hollywood police station, well known to LAN gamers. The intrigue would fit well into LA's case book. I swear some of the louche fish the cops pick up in their dragnet also act in LAN! I'm sure you get to drive some of the cars too! The end is fabulous to watch, as the killer is surrounded and the noose is pulled tight. He has no chance, the manpower deployed is overwhelming. And that's reassuring, because he's the scariest type of all, a total socio-path who will kill anyone at all. Great acting all round, with beautiful noire photography. A great shot shows you exactly why they call them "slugs". Do watch the beautiful copy at the Internet Archive. It's crisp and clear and does justice to this absorbing film.

    The film starts with Roy (Richard Basehart) killing a policeman. No-one deserves to die but this policeman was on his way home so what was he doing interfering with someone else's business, especially as we are told his dying words were "he seemed such a nice kid". Well, what was he doing stopping him then? Anyway, the film follows the police department's search for the killer. They have little to work on and Roy is quite a prolific offender. This started off with one of those annoying narration intros by someone who sounds like he is a cartoon character narrating "Whacky Races". The cast are good with Richard Basehart standing out in the lead role. There are many memorable scenes including the beginning sequence where Roy shoots the jobsworth policeman, the scene where Roy removes the bullet from where he has been shot - you can feel the pain, and the end sequence from when Roy is in his house and he senses the police closing in which includes a memorable chase through the sewers. I can't remember any music being played during the film and this adds to the realism and tension in every scene. It's a good film that's worth watching again and it's based on a true story.

    "He Walked by Night" released in 1948, is an excellent suspense drama. The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

    Until the above line was muttered by a cop to Mrs. Johnson, a liquor store owner, I hadn't considered this film to be a murder mystery. Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down. Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework. "He Walked by Night" is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's "Port of New York".

    As the story begins, a policeman on his way home sees a man lurking in the darkness, he becomes suspicious. To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers. Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item. What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree. Albert Werker directed the impressive "He Walked by Night", a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show "Dragnet" that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor. Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.

Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

    Fascinating film. It surely inspired the video game LA Noire. Many of the sights in the game are seen in this film, eg the library. There are several shots of Hollywood police station, well known to LAN gamers. The intrigue would fit well into LA's case book. I swear some of the louche fish the cops pick up in their dragnet also act in LAN! I'm sure you get to drive some of the cars too! The end is fabulous to watch, as the killer is surrounded and the noose is pulled tight. He has no chance, the manpower deployed is overwhelming. And that's reassuring, because he's the scariest type of all, a total socio-path who will kill anyone at all. Great acting all round, with beautiful noire photography. A great shot shows you exactly why they call them "slugs". Do watch the beautiful copy at the Internet Archive. It's crisp and clear and does justice to this absorbing film.

    The film starts with Roy (Richard Basehart) killing a policeman. No-one deserves to die but this policeman was on his way home so what was he doing interfering with someone else's business, especially as we are told his dying words were "he seemed such a nice kid". Well, what was he doing stopping him then? Anyway, the film follows the police department's search for the killer. They have little to work on and Roy is quite a prolific offender. This started off with one of those annoying narration intros by someone who sounds like he is a cartoon character narrating "Whacky Races". The cast are good with Richard Basehart standing out in the lead role. There are many memorable scenes including the beginning sequence where Roy shoots the jobsworth policeman, the scene where Roy removes the bullet from where he has been shot - you can feel the pain, and the end sequence from when Roy is in his house and he senses the police closing in which includes a memorable chase through the sewers. I can't remember any music being played during the film and this adds to the realism and tension in every scene. It's a good film that's worth watching again and it's based on a true story.

    "He Walked by Night" released in 1948, is an excellent suspense drama. The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

    Until the above line was muttered by a cop to Mrs. Johnson, a liquor store owner, I hadn't considered this film to be a murder mystery. Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down. Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework. "He Walked by Night" is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's "Port of New York".

    As the story begins, a policeman on his way home sees a man lurking in the darkness, he becomes suspicious. To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers. Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item. What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree. Albert Werker directed the impressive "He Walked by Night", a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show "Dragnet" that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor. Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.

    This isn't real noir by my definition which is ruled by hallucinative memory, seduction and amused fate. But others define noir as a style, in which case this does have the shadows. It's from that genealogy of noir with roots in westerns and gangster movies with its purer landscape, crisper asphalt and desert god. Viewers who want simple and efficient world mechanics will find this to their taste, no frills here. Supposedly it's just the facts. But if you look at the cinematic facts of the movie? An omniscient Filekeeper narrates. None of the cops is distinguishable as a distinct human being. And no one does anything that doesn't serve the narrated facts on file.. Crushing. It isn't alone that times have changed, though we have since seen this template countless times on TV. It isn't even that the film is populated by simple folks, mostly cops, or the case is exceedingly simple, which it is. The Naked City of the same year takes a similar 'factual' approach but doesn't feel so stolid. It may altogether be that we're hardwired to much faster thinking and simultaneously a more nuanced 'real' behavior. It probably just comes down to stiff acting and script. I was amused by a scene where the police commissioner has gathered all the witnesses in a room to help profile a picture of the suspect. Needless to say the picture turns out exactly like our guy. But watch them as they fill in the detail, the cadence, the observations, the clean delivery. It's like you've gone into a bar where everyone has been told to pretend that he's in a bar. Still, remarkable LA. In spite of everything, I might include it in my Los Angeles project. Noir Meter: 1/4

    Richard Basehart is chilling as a radio operator-turned rogue in this noir that is literally cloaked in shadows. Rather than be caught with lock-picking tools, Roy pumps a patrolman full of lead. The cop tries valiantly to fight back and a whole detail of gumshoes work the streets of LA to find this reptilian thief. The cops use a mild-mannered businessman as the bait to catch Roy, leaving him woefully vulnerable to injury or worse. Basehart is chilling in a couple of claustrophobic scenes with the sap. Basehart gets milk deliveries to feed his poor dog, and that turns out to be his undoing. The film ends jarringly abruptly, like the victim's life. Grim, harsh, and powerful.

    *Spoiler/plot- He walks the Night, 1948. A clever young criminal uses his electronic knowledge to steal and re-sell home electronic items during the early TV and radio age in Los Angeles. He is ruthless and shoots two police officers that are chasing him. The crook uses the extensive underground flood control system to keep ahead of the police. After a chase and gunfight, he is killed there. *Special Stars- Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell, Jack Webb. *Theme- Good honorable police enforcement often helps justice along the way. *Trivia/location/goofs- B & W, Film noir, Los Angeles. Semi-documentary style with narrator. Mr. Basehart had very little dialog(film voice over narrator did most of the plot exposition) but a lot of acting in this first film for him . The LAPD technical adviser talked to Jack Webb and this project became the basis for the Dragnet radio show which turned into a TV show. *Emotion- Gritty, raw, action packed, 'film noir' stark shadows across the principle characters in scenes, very little flowery dialog and raw semi-documentary shooting style make this film the granddaddy of many latter decades police dramas. The best of these film makes the viewer a participant. If you're a fan of detective film noir(like me), you'll enjoy this movie. Non-fans will find this film full of trivial faults. I did not.

    "He Walked By Night" is a low budget crime drama which tells the true story of an exceptionally resourceful cop killer and the way in which he was pursued by the LAPD. The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax. In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow. Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet. The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible. Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words. It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show "Dragnet" which also emphasised the value of methodical police work. "He Walked By Night" looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

    ***SPOILERS*** Semidocumentary style Film Nior classic that's a lot like the film "Street with no Name" released in the same year. "He Walked by Night" is based on the real life crimes of former L.A police department employee and WWII vet Erwin "Mechine-Gun" Walker who terrorized the city in the mid 1940's with a string of shootings and armed robberies. Roy Martin, Richard Besehart, has been burglarizing electrical appliances stores in L.A and pretending that what he stole he in fact invented. Martin makes a living, and a damn good one at that, by selling his stolen booty to his fence-man, who in fact doesn't known it's stolen property, electronic dealer Paul Reeves, Whit Bissell. It's when Martin is spotted by an LAPD cop one night hanging around an electronic store and looking like he's up to no good that he gunned him down thus going up the ladder in the world of crime from just a plain garden variety burglar to a wanted all points, in the state, cop killer! With every cop in the LAPD out looking for him Martin is able to avoid them in slipping into the vast 700 mile L.A sewer system thus preventing him from being captured. Despite all the precautions he takes Martin makes the mistake of going back to his "Fence-Man" Paul Reeves to make sure, by bashing his skull in and cracking a couple of his ribs, that he doesn't turn him into the police. That tips the cops on the case Sgt. Marty Brennan, Scott Brady,& Sgt. Chuck Jones,James Cardwell, off to Martin's identity. That's not after Jones ended up being brutally attacked and beaten by Martin when he spotted him and his partner Sgt. Brennan hiding out in Reeves' office. ***SPOILERS*** With his cover blown thanks to the US Post Office in tracking him down in this out of the way L.A bungalow colony Martin is now not only on the run but has his secret hideout, the sewer system, found out as well. Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

Basehart gets milk deliveries to feed his poor dog, and that turns out to be his undoing. The film ends jarringly abruptly, like the victim's life. Grim, harsh, and powerful.

    *Spoiler/plot- He walks the Night, 1948. A clever young criminal uses his electronic knowledge to steal and re-sell home electronic items during the early TV and radio age in Los Angeles. He is ruthless and shoots two police officers that are chasing him. The crook uses the extensive underground flood control system to keep ahead of the police. After a chase and gunfight, he is killed there. *Special Stars- Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell, Jack Webb. *Theme- Good honorable police enforcement often helps justice along the way. *Trivia/location/goofs- B & W, Film noir, Los Angeles. Semi-documentary style with narrator. Mr. Basehart had very little dialog(film voice over narrator did most of the plot exposition) but a lot of acting in this first film for him . The LAPD technical adviser talked to Jack Webb and this project became the basis for the Dragnet radio show which turned into a TV show. *Emotion- Gritty, raw, action packed, 'film noir' stark shadows across the principle characters in scenes, very little flowery dialog and raw semi-documentary shooting style make this film the granddaddy of many latter decades police dramas. The best of these film makes the viewer a participant. If you're a fan of detective film noir(like me), you'll enjoy this movie. Non-fans will find this film full of trivial faults. I did not.

    "He Walked By Night" is a low budget crime drama which tells the true story of an exceptionally resourceful cop killer and the way in which he was pursued by the LAPD. The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax. In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow. Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet. The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible. Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words. It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show "Dragnet" which also emphasised the value of methodical police work. "He Walked By Night" looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

    ***SPOILERS*** Semidocumentary style Film Nior classic that's a lot like the film "Street with no Name" released in the same year. "He Walked by Night" is based on the real life crimes of former L.A police department employee and WWII vet Erwin "Mechine-Gun" Walker who terrorized the city in the mid 1940's with a string of shootings and armed robberies. Roy Martin, Richard Besehart, has been burglarizing electrical appliances stores in L.A and pretending that what he stole he in fact invented. Martin makes a living, and a damn good one at that, by selling his stolen booty to his fence-man, who in fact doesn't known it's stolen property, electronic dealer Paul Reeves, Whit Bissell. It's when Martin is spotted by an LAPD cop one night hanging around an electronic store and looking like he's up to no good that he gunned him down thus going up the ladder in the world of crime from just a plain garden variety burglar to a wanted all points, in the state, cop killer! With every cop in the LAPD out looking for him Martin is able to avoid them in slipping into the vast 700 mile L.A sewer system thus preventing him from being captured. Despite all the precautions he takes Martin makes the mistake of going back to his "Fence-Man" Paul Reeves to make sure, by bashing his skull in and cracking a couple of his ribs, that he doesn't turn him into the police. That tips the cops on the case Sgt. Marty Brennan, Scott Brady,& Sgt. Chuck Jones,James Cardwell, off to Martin's identity. That's not after Jones ended up being brutally attacked and beaten by Martin when he spotted him and his partner Sgt. Brennan hiding out in Reeves' office. ***SPOILERS*** With his cover blown thanks to the US Post Office in tracking him down in this out of the way L.A bungalow colony Martin is now not only on the run but has his secret hideout, the sewer system, found out as well. Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

    Fascinating film. It surely inspired the video game LA Noire. Many of the sights in the game are seen in this film, eg the library. There are several shots of Hollywood police station, well known to LAN gamers. The intrigue would fit well into LA's case book. I swear some of the louche fish the cops pick up in their dragnet also act in LAN! I'm sure you get to drive some of the cars too! The end is fabulous to watch, as the killer is surrounded and the noose is pulled tight. He has no chance, the manpower deployed is overwhelming. And that's reassuring, because he's the scariest type of all, a total socio-path who will kill anyone at all. Great acting all round, with beautiful noire photography. A great shot shows you exactly why they call them "slugs". Do watch the beautiful copy at the Internet Archive. It's crisp and clear and does justice to this absorbing film.

    The film starts with Roy (Richard Basehart) killing a policeman. No-one deserves to die but this policeman was on his way home so what was he doing interfering with someone else's business, especially as we are told his dying words were "he seemed such a nice kid". Well, what was he doing stopping him then? Anyway, the film follows the police department's search for the killer. They have little to work on and Roy is quite a prolific offender. This started off with one of those annoying narration intros by someone who sounds like he is a cartoon character narrating "Whacky Races". The cast are good with Richard Basehart standing out in the lead role. There are many memorable scenes including the beginning sequence where Roy shoots the jobsworth policeman, the scene where Roy removes the bullet from where he has been shot - you can feel the pain, and the end sequence from when Roy is in his house and he senses the police closing in which includes a memorable chase through the sewers. I can't remember any music being played during the film and this adds to the realism and tension in every scene. It's a good film that's worth watching again and it's based on a true story.

    "He Walked by Night" released in 1948, is an excellent suspense drama. The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

    Until the above line was muttered by a cop to Mrs. Johnson, a liquor store owner, I hadn't considered this film to be a murder mystery. Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down. Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework. "He Walked by Night" is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's "Port of New York".

    As the story begins, a policeman on his way home sees a man lurking in the darkness, he becomes suspicious. To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers. Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item. What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree. Albert Werker directed the impressive "He Walked by Night", a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show "Dragnet" that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor. Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.

    This isn't real noir by my definition which is ruled by hallucinative memory, seduction and amused fate. But others define noir as a style, in which case this does have the shadows. It's from that genealogy of noir with roots in westerns and gangster movies with its purer landscape, crisper asphalt and desert god. Viewers who want simple and efficient world mechanics will find this to their taste, no frills here. Supposedly it's just the facts. But if you look at the cinematic facts of the movie? An omniscient Filekeeper narrates. None of the cops is distinguishable as a distinct human being. And no one does anything that doesn't serve the narrated facts on file.. Crushing. It isn't alone that times have changed, though we have since seen this template countless times on TV. It isn't even that the film is populated by simple folks, mostly cops, or the case is exceedingly simple, which it is. The Naked City of the same year takes a similar 'factual' approach but doesn't feel so stolid. It may altogether be that we're hardwired to much faster thinking and simultaneously a more nuanced 'real' behavior. It probably just comes down to stiff acting and script. I was amused by a scene where the police commissioner has gathered all the witnesses in a room to help profile a picture of the suspect. Needless to say the picture turns out exactly like our guy. But watch them as they fill in the detail, the cadence, the observations, the clean delivery. It's like you've gone into a bar where everyone has been told to pretend that he's in a bar. Still, remarkable LA. In spite of everything, I might include it in my Los Angeles project. Noir Meter: 1/4

    Richard Basehart is chilling as a radio operator-turned rogue in this noir that is literally cloaked in shadows. Rather than be caught with lock-picking tools, Roy pumps a patrolman full of lead. The cop tries valiantly to fight back and a whole detail of gumshoes work the streets of LA to find this reptilian thief. The cops use a mild-mannered businessman as the bait to catch Roy, leaving him woefully vulnerable to injury or worse. Basehart is chilling in a couple of claustrophobic scenes with the sap. Basehart gets milk deliveries to feed his poor dog, and that turns out to be his undoing. The film ends jarringly abruptly, like the victim's life. Grim, harsh, and powerful.

    Until the above line was muttered by a cop to Mrs. Johnson, a liquor store owner, I hadn't considered this film to be a murder mystery. Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down. Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework. "He Walked by Night" is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's "Port of New York".

    As the story begins, a policeman on his way home sees a man lurking in the darkness, he becomes suspicious. To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers. Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item. What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree. Albert Werker directed the impressive "He Walked by Night", a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show "Dragnet" that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor. Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.

    This isn't real noir by my definition which is ruled by hallucinative memory, seduction and amused fate. But others define noir as a style, in which case this does have the shadows. It's from that genealogy of noir with roots in westerns and gangster movies with its purer landscape, crisper asphalt and desert god. Viewers who want simple and efficient world mechanics will find this to their taste, no frills here. Supposedly it's just the facts. But if you look at the cinematic facts of the movie? An omniscient Filekeeper narrates. None of the cops is distinguishable as a distinct human being. And no one does anything that doesn't serve the narrated facts on file.. Crushing. It isn't alone that times have changed, though we have since seen this template countless times on TV. It isn't even that the film is populated by simple folks, mostly cops, or the case is exceedingly simple, which it is. The Naked City of the same year takes a similar 'factual' approach but doesn't feel so stolid. It may altogether be that we're hardwired to much faster thinking and simultaneously a more nuanced 'real' behavior. It probably just comes down to stiff acting and script. I was amused by a scene where the police commissioner has gathered all the witnesses in a room to help profile a picture of the suspect. Needless to say the picture turns out exactly like our guy. But watch them as they fill in the detail, the cadence, the observations, the clean delivery. It's like you've gone into a bar where everyone has been told to pretend that he's in a bar. Still, remarkable LA. In spite of everything, I might include it in my Los Angeles project. Noir Meter: 1/4

    Richard Basehart is chilling as a radio operator-turned rogue in this noir that is literally cloaked in shadows. Rather than be caught with lock-picking tools, Roy pumps a patrolman full of lead. The cop tries valiantly to fight back and a whole detail of gumshoes work the streets of LA to find this reptilian thief. The cops use a mild-mannered businessman as the bait to catch Roy, leaving him woefully vulnerable to injury or worse. Basehart is chilling in a couple of claustrophobic scenes with the sap. Basehart gets milk deliveries to feed his poor dog, and that turns out to be his undoing. The film ends jarringly abruptly, like the victim's life. Grim, harsh, and powerful.

    *Spoiler/plot- He walks the Night, 1948. A clever young criminal uses his electronic knowledge to steal and re-sell home electronic items during the early TV and radio age in Los Angeles. He is ruthless and shoots two police officers that are chasing him. The crook uses the extensive underground flood control system to keep ahead of the police. After a chase and gunfight, he is killed there. *Special Stars- Richard Basehart, Scott Brady, Roy Roberts, Whit Bissell, Jack Webb. *Theme- Good honorable police enforcement often helps justice along the way. *Trivia/location/goofs- B & W, Film noir, Los Angeles. Semi-documentary style with narrator. Mr. Basehart had very little dialog(film voice over narrator did most of the plot exposition) but a lot of acting in this first film for him . The LAPD technical adviser talked to Jack Webb and this project became the basis for the Dragnet radio show which turned into a TV show. *Emotion- Gritty, raw, action packed, 'film noir' stark shadows across the principle characters in scenes, very little flowery dialog and raw semi-documentary shooting style make this film the granddaddy of many latter decades police dramas. The best of these film makes the viewer a participant. If you're a fan of detective film noir(like me), you'll enjoy this movie. Non-fans will find this film full of trivial faults. I did not.

    "He Walked By Night" is a low budget crime drama which tells the true story of an exceptionally resourceful cop killer and the way in which he was pursued by the LAPD. The methods used by the police and the killer couldn't be more different, as the LAPD place a high value on adhering to standard procedures whereas their quarry uses his considerable ingenuity and expert knowledge of electronics to outwit his pursuers. This all makes for a fascinating cat and mouse game which is compelling to watch and becomes increasingly intense as it moves towards its exciting and visually impressive climax. In the early hours of a summer morning, Roy Martin (Richard Basehart) is trying to break into an electronics store when he sees a police patrol car approaching and casually walks away. The police car follows him and when he's asked to produce some identification, Martin pulls out a gun and shoots the police officer at point blank range. Detective Sergeants Marty Brennan (Scott Brady) and Chuck Jones (James Cardwell) are assigned to the case by Police Captain Breen (Roy Roberts) but their initial efforts to identify the killer draw a blank because there are no leads to follow. Martin regularly sells electronic equipment to a dealer called Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell) who becomes suspicious after one of his customers recognises a television projector (which Martin had supplied) as one that had been stolen from him. After Reeves reports the matter to the police, Brennan and Jones wait in the dealer's office with the intention of arresting Martin but his eventual arrival culminates in a shootout which ends with both Martin and Detective Jones having been shot. Jones is seriously injured and Martin goes home and successfully operates on himself to remove the bullet. The LAPD are determined to hunt down Martin but he continues to keep one step ahead of them by regularly changing his appearance and listening in to their radio communications until Detective Jones has a hunch which enables the police to positively confirm the identity of the killer. This piece of knowledge together with information that they subsequently find about Martin's previous employment, soon enables them to continue their manhunt with greater speed and success than had previously been possible. Roy Martin's story is told in typical docu-noir style complete with the obligatory solemn narration (by Reed Hadley) and some acting which, by today's standards, is rather stiff and formal. Richard Basehart, however, is exceptionally good in his role as the psychopathic loner and World War 11 veteran who's cold, calculating and extremely ruthless. He's a particularly interesting character as he's both intelligent and highly skilled in some areas but also paranoid and a man of few words. It's widely acknowledged that Jack Webb (who appears in this movie as a laboratory technician) was inspired by the experience to create his own very popular radio and TV show "Dragnet" which also emphasised the value of methodical police work. "He Walked By Night" looks very realistic and is often suspenseful but its most impressive feature is John Alton's incredible cinematography which enhances the look of the whole movie considerably and contributes to the claustrophobic feel of certain passages. His use of low key lighting, deep focus photography and interesting camera angles is inspired, effective and dramatic and at times, bathes the screen in compositions which create a rather disconcerting atmosphere.

    ***SPOILERS*** Semidocumentary style Film Nior classic that's a lot like the film "Street with no Name" released in the same year. "He Walked by Night" is based on the real life crimes of former L.A police department employee and WWII vet Erwin "Mechine-Gun" Walker who terrorized the city in the mid 1940's with a string of shootings and armed robberies. Roy Martin, Richard Besehart, has been burglarizing electrical appliances stores in L.A and pretending that what he stole he in fact invented. Martin makes a living, and a damn good one at that, by selling his stolen booty to his fence-man, who in fact doesn't known it's stolen property, electronic dealer Paul Reeves, Whit Bissell. It's when Martin is spotted by an LAPD cop one night hanging around an electronic store and looking like he's up to no good that he gunned him down thus going up the ladder in the world of crime from just a plain garden variety burglar to a wanted all points, in the state, cop killer! With every cop in the LAPD out looking for him Martin is able to avoid them in slipping into the vast 700 mile L.A sewer system thus preventing him from being captured. Despite all the precautions he takes Martin makes the mistake of going back to his "Fence-Man" Paul Reeves to make sure, by bashing his skull in and cracking a couple of his ribs, that he doesn't turn him into the police. That tips the cops on the case Sgt. Marty Brennan, Scott Brady,& Sgt. Chuck Jones,James Cardwell, off to Martin's identity. That's not after Jones ended up being brutally attacked and beaten by Martin when he spotted him and his partner Sgt. Brennan hiding out in Reeves' office. ***SPOILERS*** With his cover blown thanks to the US Post Office in tracking him down in this out of the way L.A bungalow colony Martin is now not only on the run but has his secret hideout, the sewer system, found out as well. Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

    Fascinating film. It surely inspired the video game LA Noire. Many of the sights in the game are seen in this film, eg the library. There are several shots of Hollywood police station, well known to LAN gamers. The intrigue would fit well into LA's case book. I swear some of the louche fish the cops pick up in their dragnet also act in LAN! I'm sure you get to drive some of the cars too! The end is fabulous to watch, as the killer is surrounded and the noose is pulled tight. He has no chance, the manpower deployed is overwhelming. And that's reassuring, because he's the scariest type of all, a total socio-path who will kill anyone at all. Great acting all round, with beautiful noire photography. A great shot shows you exactly why they call them "slugs". Do watch the beautiful copy at the Internet Archive. It's crisp and clear and does justice to this absorbing film.

    The film starts with Roy (Richard Basehart) killing a policeman. No-one deserves to die but this policeman was on his way home so what was he doing interfering with someone else's business, especially as we are told his dying words were "he seemed such a nice kid". Well, what was he doing stopping him then? Anyway, the film follows the police department's search for the killer. They have little to work on and Roy is quite a prolific offender. This started off with one of those annoying narration intros by someone who sounds like he is a cartoon character narrating "Whacky Races". The cast are good with Richard Basehart standing out in the lead role. There are many memorable scenes including the beginning sequence where Roy shoots the jobsworth policeman, the scene where Roy removes the bullet from where he has been shot - you can feel the pain, and the end sequence from when Roy is in his house and he senses the police closing in which includes a memorable chase through the sewers. I can't remember any music being played during the film and this adds to the realism and tension in every scene. It's a good film that's worth watching again and it's based on a true story.

    "He Walked by Night" released in 1948, is an excellent suspense drama. The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

"He Walked by Night" is based on the real life crimes of former L.A police department employee and WWII vet Erwin "Mechine-Gun" Walker who terrorized the city in the mid 1940's with a string of shootings and armed robberies. Roy Martin, Richard Besehart, has been burglarizing electrical appliances stores in L.A and pretending that what he stole he in fact invented. Martin makes a living, and a damn good one at that, by selling his stolen booty to his fence-man, who in fact doesn't known it's stolen property, electronic dealer Paul Reeves, Whit Bissell. It's when Martin is spotted by an LAPD cop one night hanging around an electronic store and looking like he's up to no good that he gunned him down thus going up the ladder in the world of crime from just a plain garden variety burglar to a wanted all points, in the state, cop killer! With every cop in the LAPD out looking for him Martin is able to avoid them in slipping into the vast 700 mile L.A sewer system thus preventing him from being captured. Despite all the precautions he takes Martin makes the mistake of going back to his "Fence-Man" Paul Reeves to make sure, by bashing his skull in and cracking a couple of his ribs, that he doesn't turn him into the police. That tips the cops on the case Sgt. Marty Brennan, Scott Brady,& Sgt. Chuck Jones,James Cardwell, off to Martin's identity. That's not after Jones ended up being brutally attacked and beaten by Martin when he spotted him and his partner Sgt. Brennan hiding out in Reeves' office. ***SPOILERS*** With his cover blown thanks to the US Post Office in tracking him down in this out of the way L.A bungalow colony Martin is now not only on the run but has his secret hideout, the sewer system, found out as well. Like a cornered rat having nowhere to go with his escape route, a manhole cover, blocked by an LAPD patrol car all he can do now is shoot it out with the oncoming police that in Martin's case turns out to be fatal. The sewer system scenes in the movie were later used, in 1956, in the Lon Cheney Jr horror suspense movie "Indestrutable Man" where he played the just brought back from the dead, through a massive electronic jolt, zombie-like mass murderer Butcher Benton. The movie "He Walked by Night" also has a 27 year old Jack Webb playing police forensic specialist Lee Whitey. Webb became so interested in police work during the filming that with the support of LAPD cop Sgt. Marty Wynn, who served as a police technical adviser in the film, he came up with the idea for his blockbuster radio and later TV police drama series "Dragnet".

    Fascinating film. It surely inspired the video game LA Noire. Many of the sights in the game are seen in this film, eg the library. There are several shots of Hollywood police station, well known to LAN gamers. The intrigue would fit well into LA's case book. I swear some of the louche fish the cops pick up in their dragnet also act in LAN! I'm sure you get to drive some of the cars too! The end is fabulous to watch, as the killer is surrounded and the noose is pulled tight. He has no chance, the manpower deployed is overwhelming. And that's reassuring, because he's the scariest type of all, a total socio-path who will kill anyone at all. Great acting all round, with beautiful noire photography. A great shot shows you exactly why they call them "slugs". Do watch the beautiful copy at the Internet Archive. It's crisp and clear and does justice to this absorbing film.

    The film starts with Roy (Richard Basehart) killing a policeman. No-one deserves to die but this policeman was on his way home so what was he doing interfering with someone else's business, especially as we are told his dying words were "he seemed such a nice kid". Well, what was he doing stopping him then? Anyway, the film follows the police department's search for the killer. They have little to work on and Roy is quite a prolific offender. This started off with one of those annoying narration intros by someone who sounds like he is a cartoon character narrating "Whacky Races". The cast are good with Richard Basehart standing out in the lead role. There are many memorable scenes including the beginning sequence where Roy shoots the jobsworth policeman, the scene where Roy removes the bullet from where he has been shot - you can feel the pain, and the end sequence from when Roy is in his house and he senses the police closing in which includes a memorable chase through the sewers. I can't remember any music being played during the film and this adds to the realism and tension in every scene. It's a good film that's worth watching again and it's based on a true story.

    "He Walked by Night" released in 1948, is an excellent suspense drama. The film is set in Los Angeles, which is interesting considering so many of the crime dramas of this era are usually set in New York. Richard Basehart plays a sociopath who kills a police officer when he stops him on the street for suspicious behavior. Basehart is also an electronics genius, and he can hear radio police calls in his home. He also manages to elude the police for months -- this man is no ordinary criminal. He is smart, alert, and a complete loner. Detectives Scott Brady and Roy Roberts are the two actors who take the lead in tracking Basehart down. The film takes us into the streets of Los Angeles (population 2 million in 1948!) and in underground storm water tunnels, which Basehart cleverly uses for his get-aways from cops. This film is reportedly based on a true story about a killer who eluded cops for months and terrorized the city in 1947. The actors who play the cops are good ones, but it is Richard Basehart who is the real star of the film. He plays his part brilliantly -- he doesn't hit a false note. Basehart had the looks and talent to be a major player in Hollywood, but he never really became a big star. What a shame.

    Until the above line was muttered by a cop to Mrs. Johnson, a liquor store owner, I hadn't considered this film to be a murder mystery. Yes, Officer Rawlins died some time after being shot by Morgan/Martin (Richard Basehart), and there was that hit on Detective Chuck Jones (James Cardwell), but he lived, and it didn't seem to me that murder was the focus of the story. It had more to do it seems, with the cunning displayed by Basehart's character in pulling off small time burglaries, then graduating to armed robbery, all the while leaving no clues and eluding authority's attempt to track him down. Nor does the film completely fill the noir definition with it's lack of a slick and dangerous femme-fatale. What it does have though for fans of these Forties era flicks, is Jack Webb in a nice warm-up for his radio and TV 'Dragnet' series, filling the role of a forensics cop who provides the first lead to Roy Martin's real identity. The neatest twist of the whole story, for me at least, was watching Martin maneuver his way around the underground LA sewer system, and pull a rifle out of a carefully selected hiding spot! Now there was a guy who did his homework. "He Walked by Night" is one of those ubiquitous public domain titles you'll find packaged by itself or in compilations of a hundred pictures or more. It's a bit slow in spots but generally manages to hold interest and entertain in a satisfactory way. Scott Brady fans will get a kick seeing him here at the tender age of twenty four but looking considerably older. A year later, he would travel cross country as a customs agent to go up against Yul Brynner in 1949's "Port of New York".

    As the story begins, a policeman on his way home sees a man lurking in the darkness, he becomes suspicious. To his amazement, the man surprises him pulling a gun and shoots him. The incident marks the beginning of a dragnet in which all police resources will concentrate in apprehending the criminal that killed one of their peers. Roy Martin, as he calls himself, is a young man with an unusual ability for everything electric. He likes to put things together, then tries to interest Paul Reeves, a businessman with an important clientele to lease the things Martin brings him. All goes well until the time he makes a tactical mistake. He leaves an equipment for television that turns out to have been stolen from the same man that Reeves has called to peddle the item. What the LAPD doesn't know is that Roy Martin has a way for evading the enemy. He has discovered the system under the Los Angeles streets for the heavy flash floods it experiences to make his getaway. He is a slippery man with superior intelligence to outsmart the police. Ultimately, the police gets a break that will put an end to Roy's crime spree. Albert Werker directed the impressive "He Walked by Night", a 1948 film noir that went to be imitated by a lot of people in Hollywood. It also became the model of the television show "Dragnet" that came later, in which Jack Webb, who is prominently featured, explored some of the principles originated in the breakthrough film. Anthony Mann was also on board to help with the direction, and it shows, although he is not given credit for the work he did. Crane Wilbur and John Higgins wrote the screenplay in a semi-documentary style. It is a tribute to all the creators the film has survived long after it was first released. The best thing in the film is John Alton's black and white cinematography that captures the Los Angeles of that era in all its splendor. Richard Basehart made a cool Roy Martin. This was Mr. Basehart's third picture and he showed a great potential as the criminal that was able to outsmart the police. The supporting players, Scott Brady, Whit Bissell, James Cardwell, and Roy Roberts, among them, do a good job under Mr. Werker's direction.
