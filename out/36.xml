    I love Drew Barrymore and I've never seen her look more desirable than in this movie. She has short blonde hair and a beautiful smile. Drew is a chick with some kind of mental problem. She soon meets Chris O'Donnell, who decides it would be a good idea to shirk all responsibility to his family in favor of kidnapping Drew and hitting the road as a fugitive. Chris is so dumb, he doesn't leave Seattle for Canada, which is only a few miles north. No, Chris is smarter than that. He heads for Mexico! What a dweeb. The unlikely duo stumbles into a restaurant in Salinas (California) where Drew misses out on the shrimp she ordered so she can go to the toilet, take off the ugly dress Chris bought for her, and crawl around on the floor while checking for a secret door behind the commode. These adventures continue for awhile until Drew comes to her senses and dumps O'Dumbbell. OK for teenyboppers. Others may be bored out of their freaking minds.

    Although in the movie she is diagnosed with clinical depression that is not what the character has. Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline. She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me. *Contains Spoilers* "A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation." In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense. She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him. When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days. Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents. Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew. He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire. "Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving)." This is the most obvious in the movie. She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight. She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris. She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car. She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her. Smokes cigarettes. I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners. "Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself." She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide. She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack. Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating. "Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)." She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way. The episode in the bathroom also. "Chronic feelings of emptiness" Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness. When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him. It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing. It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly. "Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)." She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette. "Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms." When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score. She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents. "Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self." This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general. I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity. Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer. Medications can't really help other than treating symptoms like depression or anxiety. The affect on the family and boyfriend also show how real life families struggle with a loved one suffers from it. Chris is often walking on eggshells to avoid offending or hurting her. What makes this movie so good is the perfect example of a mental illness. This is a rare thing to seen in movies, usually they mix disorder u p and get them all wrong. I recommend this movie to anyone that suffers from or know someone that suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder. I suffer from it myself and set my first boyfriend through the ringer like she did. Once I found out what it was, well now I know what i have and am getting the right treatment for it.

    Drew Barrymore is committed temporarily to a mental ward and everything is fine for awhile until her idiot boyfriend Chris O'Donnell gets the bright idea to 'rescue' her and take her on the lam with him. The two fugitives begin their journey in Seattle and decide to head for Mexico. (Note to Chris: the Canadien border is only a few miles to the north - never mind). During this time, our 'heroes' drive blindfolded on a dangerous cliff, Chris steals a man's truck, and Drew gets the urge to play Russian roulette in the desert. Before long, Drew is in the ward again and Chris goes back to being A GUY DREW WOULD NEVER WASTE HER TIME ON. Aimless and stupid, but Drew is totally cute.

    I can't fathom why so many people have called this a "romantic comedy". It is in no way a comedy and while there is a romance that carries along with it, the plot isn't about the romance. It's about mental illness and how it affects the person and those around them. It felt like the ending as intended was when the doors closed behind Drew's character as she entered the hospital. The narrated ending seems tacked on, probably had too many people at the screenings that didn't care for whatever was the original ending. The studio perhaps felt pressure to make it a bit more upbeat and hopeful. I didn't mind an upbeat ending too much though, I'm generally a sucker for "Hollywood" endings. Plus it didn't seem to take away anything from her suffering. She's doing better with the help of doctors, not magically cured. As for Chris O'Donnell's performance, I thought it was fine. He didn't stand out and I don't think he was supposed to. His character was supposed to be a bit shy and geeky. This was obvious from the scenes leading up to him talking to Drew's character. As a disclaimer I like Drew Barrymore in everything I've seen her in, not necessarily the movie, but her performance at least. This has to be not only one of her best performances but one of the best performances in a film period. Yes, a lot of people would disagree with me but for anyone who has known someone suffering from depression and especially bi-polar disorder I think they'd agree she portrayed it amazingly well.

    This is a love story, of sorts, which conflicts the viewer in that it tenderly presents this tragic heroine and then shocks the audience by eloquently demonstrating the ins and outs of the moderate-to-severe bi-polar disorder, with which the heroine attempts to live. (The mother states her daughter suffers from depression, but Drew's depiction does NOT indicate depression alone. There are extreme highs and bottom-dipping lows, which would be more indicative of manic depression or bi-polar disorder than depression alone. Not to minimize the life-changing effects of clinical or chemical depression, because I'm not.) Drew generates a stellar performance here, and fully sells the range of emotions her character experiences. Her portrayal is dead on perfect; in not just the disease itself, but her depth and range here is nothing short of phenomenal. Chris O'Donnell is not as lacking as some would make one believe. He contributes an adequate performance as a young man without a clue; therefore, his character is vastly disliked because he comes off as clueless, and movie-goers associated him with the character. Go figure. This work is seriously underrated, primarily due to the unsatisfactorily heart-wrenching ending, but also due to the audiences inability to conceive of Drew as anything but bubbly and intelligent. She customarily takes parts in which her character is put in a sweet (if rose-colored) light, whereas her role herein is quite edgy and tragic. The screenplay itself is not solid. The flux is very fluid within this story. The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris, and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line. I actually enjoyed this, though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy. It rates an 8.4/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This is the classic tale of young love gone all wrong. Bad girl, Casey (Drew Barrymore) good guy (Chris ODonnell) fall MADLY in love with one another. She's got problems(oppressive parents, emotionally disturbed). Naturally, after she creates a series of events that screw up Matt's plans for the future & both sets of parents forbid their relationship, they RUN away together. All is going well & good until Casey completely loses it.....But the END of the movie is what satisfies. It's not your usual tragic tale with a happy ending that you're always hoping for & expecting. & as always...a great soundtrack does a lot for a movie. If you're into the early 90's grunge movement/alternative rock deal, you'll love the music & the scene with the band, Seven Year Bitch. They rock!

    Mad Love success is formally down to the leads Drew Barrymore and Chris O' Donnell. Their chemistry together, their development, twists and turns make you genuinely care about the characters. If that's the only reason you see the film then go right ahead. The subject of Bi-Polar is sensitively approached under the direction of Antonia Bird and I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite coming - of age dramas and made me fall in love with both Barrymore and O'Donnell and follow along on their incredible journey together. Some may guffaw at the cinematography, it is a fairly old film but the most important thing is the story and the acting which remain strong throughout.

    Mad Love stars Chris O Donnell, who sets his sights on high school love, Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, the girl he dates does not come across as the average teenager. She suffers from severe depression and this becomes progressive. The outbursts and mental problems threaten to break up the otherwise close relationship but to his credit, O Donnell sticks by her and his love for her becomes clear. The pair are real opposites but carry a unique love for each other. Leland is the caring, hard-working, clever, shy and conscientious type whilst Roberts is the outgoing, partying and slacking girl, always out for a bit of fun. Its hard for the guy to begin with but he fits the bill perfectly, low-key and probably slightly shy in reality, really does translate well to the big screen. His tentative first steps to love are shown and arguably, there is not really a better talent out there to slip on the shoes of Leland. The relationship becomes frustrating but as with any other romantic drama, there are always strains on the relationship. One tends to feel sorry for O Donnell but at the same time, holds much respect for the guy. This could be a very real situation, minus some of the slightly overblown depressive outbursts from Barrymore. There is also the added say from both parents whilst Donnell tries to keep his feet on the ground with his SAT's and everything but ends up giving way to the girl he loves so much. At the end of the day, there is really no substitute. So, to conclude, O Donnell excels in a masterful albeit low-key role with a half-decent Barrymore to throw in some light-hearted and serious, sad scenes. Not a bad movie at all. 7/10.

    Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse, along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance. I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence (scored with an abominable rock song); unfortunately, it does. Boy meets girl at school, they flirt, they date, they run off together. The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced. It isn't a fresh spin, although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new, and who knows? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments. To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating, not to mention terribly irresponsible, and not quite the "wild and sexy adventure" advertised. NO STARS from ****

    This film feels like an indie set-up but the mainstream stars (Chris O'Donnel and Drew Barrymore) give it a false sense of Hollywood glamour. Donnel's character is as bland as a blancmange, leaving Barrymore to seize centre stage in an even yet watchable performance as a depressed young woman. The problem with the film is we never know why she suffers. Not much is revealed about her parents or her upbringing. The film seems to have lost its way. what should have been a quirky indie film is spoiled by an obtrusive rock soundtrack that mocks the serious subject at hand. The cinematography is pretty poor too. All in all, a wasted opportunity for all concerned.

Leland is the caring, hard-working, clever, shy and conscientious type whilst Roberts is the outgoing, partying and slacking girl, always out for a bit of fun. Its hard for the guy to begin with but he fits the bill perfectly, low-key and probably slightly shy in reality, really does translate well to the big screen. His tentative first steps to love are shown and arguably, there is not really a better talent out there to slip on the shoes of Leland. The relationship becomes frustrating but as with any other romantic drama, there are always strains on the relationship. One tends to feel sorry for O Donnell but at the same time, holds much respect for the guy. This could be a very real situation, minus some of the slightly overblown depressive outbursts from Barrymore. There is also the added say from both parents whilst Donnell tries to keep his feet on the ground with his SAT's and everything but ends up giving way to the girl he loves so much. At the end of the day, there is really no substitute. So, to conclude, O Donnell excels in a masterful albeit low-key role with a half-decent Barrymore to throw in some light-hearted and serious, sad scenes. Not a bad movie at all. 7/10.

    Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse, along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance. I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence (scored with an abominable rock song); unfortunately, it does. Boy meets girl at school, they flirt, they date, they run off together. The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced. It isn't a fresh spin, although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new, and who knows? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments. To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating, not to mention terribly irresponsible, and not quite the "wild and sexy adventure" advertised. NO STARS from ****

    This film feels like an indie set-up but the mainstream stars (Chris O'Donnel and Drew Barrymore) give it a false sense of Hollywood glamour. Donnel's character is as bland as a blancmange, leaving Barrymore to seize centre stage in an even yet watchable performance as a depressed young woman. The problem with the film is we never know why she suffers. Not much is revealed about her parents or her upbringing. The film seems to have lost its way. what should have been a quirky indie film is spoiled by an obtrusive rock soundtrack that mocks the serious subject at hand. The cinematography is pretty poor too. All in all, a wasted opportunity for all concerned.

    I love Drew Barrymore and I've never seen her look more desirable than in this movie. She has short blonde hair and a beautiful smile. Drew is a chick with some kind of mental problem. She soon meets Chris O'Donnell, who decides it would be a good idea to shirk all responsibility to his family in favor of kidnapping Drew and hitting the road as a fugitive. Chris is so dumb, he doesn't leave Seattle for Canada, which is only a few miles north. No, Chris is smarter than that. He heads for Mexico! What a dweeb. The unlikely duo stumbles into a restaurant in Salinas (California) where Drew misses out on the shrimp she ordered so she can go to the toilet, take off the ugly dress Chris bought for her, and crawl around on the floor while checking for a secret door behind the commode. These adventures continue for awhile until Drew comes to her senses and dumps O'Dumbbell. OK for teenyboppers. Others may be bored out of their freaking minds.

    Although in the movie she is diagnosed with clinical depression that is not what the character has. Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline. She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me. *Contains Spoilers* "A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation." In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense. She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him. When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days. Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents. Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew. He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire. "Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving)." This is the most obvious in the movie. She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight. She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris. She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car. She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her. Smokes cigarettes. I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners. "Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself." She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide. She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack. Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating. "Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)." She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way. The episode in the bathroom also. "Chronic feelings of emptiness" Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness. When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him. It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing. It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly. "Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)." She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette. "Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms." When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score. She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents. "Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self." This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general. I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity. Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer. Medications can't really help other than treating symptoms like depression or anxiety. The affect on the family and boyfriend also show how real life families struggle with a loved one suffers from it. Chris is often walking on eggshells to avoid offending or hurting her. What makes this movie so good is the perfect example of a mental illness. This is a rare thing to seen in movies, usually they mix disorder u p and get them all wrong. I recommend this movie to anyone that suffers from or know someone that suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder. I suffer from it myself and set my first boyfriend through the ringer like she did. Once I found out what it was, well now I know what i have and am getting the right treatment for it.

    Drew Barrymore is committed temporarily to a mental ward and everything is fine for awhile until her idiot boyfriend Chris O'Donnell gets the bright idea to 'rescue' her and take her on the lam with him. The two fugitives begin their journey in Seattle and decide to head for Mexico. (Note to Chris: the Canadien border is only a few miles to the north - never mind). During this time, our 'heroes' drive blindfolded on a dangerous cliff, Chris steals a man's truck, and Drew gets the urge to play Russian roulette in the desert. Before long, Drew is in the ward again and Chris goes back to being A GUY DREW WOULD NEVER WASTE HER TIME ON. Aimless and stupid, but Drew is totally cute.

    I can't fathom why so many people have called this a "romantic comedy". It is in no way a comedy and while there is a romance that carries along with it, the plot isn't about the romance. It's about mental illness and how it affects the person and those around them. It felt like the ending as intended was when the doors closed behind Drew's character as she entered the hospital. The narrated ending seems tacked on, probably had too many people at the screenings that didn't care for whatever was the original ending. The studio perhaps felt pressure to make it a bit more upbeat and hopeful. I didn't mind an upbeat ending too much though, I'm generally a sucker for "Hollywood" endings. Plus it didn't seem to take away anything from her suffering. She's doing better with the help of doctors, not magically cured. As for Chris O'Donnell's performance, I thought it was fine. He didn't stand out and I don't think he was supposed to. His character was supposed to be a bit shy and geeky. This was obvious from the scenes leading up to him talking to Drew's character. As a disclaimer I like Drew Barrymore in everything I've seen her in, not necessarily the movie, but her performance at least. This has to be not only one of her best performances but one of the best performances in a film period. Yes, a lot of people would disagree with me but for anyone who has known someone suffering from depression and especially bi-polar disorder I think they'd agree she portrayed it amazingly well.

    This is a love story, of sorts, which conflicts the viewer in that it tenderly presents this tragic heroine and then shocks the audience by eloquently demonstrating the ins and outs of the moderate-to-severe bi-polar disorder, with which the heroine attempts to live. (The mother states her daughter suffers from depression, but Drew's depiction does NOT indicate depression alone. There are extreme highs and bottom-dipping lows, which would be more indicative of manic depression or bi-polar disorder than depression alone. Not to minimize the life-changing effects of clinical or chemical depression, because I'm not.) Drew generates a stellar performance here, and fully sells the range of emotions her character experiences. Her portrayal is dead on perfect; in not just the disease itself, but her depth and range here is nothing short of phenomenal. Chris O'Donnell is not as lacking as some would make one believe. He contributes an adequate performance as a young man without a clue; therefore, his character is vastly disliked because he comes off as clueless, and movie-goers associated him with the character. Go figure. This work is seriously underrated, primarily due to the unsatisfactorily heart-wrenching ending, but also due to the audiences inability to conceive of Drew as anything but bubbly and intelligent. She customarily takes parts in which her character is put in a sweet (if rose-colored) light, whereas her role herein is quite edgy and tragic. The screenplay itself is not solid. The flux is very fluid within this story. The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris, and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line. I actually enjoyed this, though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy. It rates an 8.4/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This is the classic tale of young love gone all wrong. Bad girl, Casey (Drew Barrymore) good guy (Chris ODonnell) fall MADLY in love with one another. She's got problems(oppressive parents, emotionally disturbed). Naturally, after she creates a series of events that screw up Matt's plans for the future & both sets of parents forbid their relationship, they RUN away together. All is going well & good until Casey completely loses it.....But the END of the movie is what satisfies. It's not your usual tragic tale with a happy ending that you're always hoping for & expecting. & as always...a great soundtrack does a lot for a movie. If you're into the early 90's grunge movement/alternative rock deal, you'll love the music & the scene with the band, Seven Year Bitch. They rock!

    Mad Love success is formally down to the leads Drew Barrymore and Chris O' Donnell. Their chemistry together, their development, twists and turns make you genuinely care about the characters. If that's the only reason you see the film then go right ahead. The subject of Bi-Polar is sensitively approached under the direction of Antonia Bird and I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite coming - of age dramas and made me fall in love with both Barrymore and O'Donnell and follow along on their incredible journey together. Some may guffaw at the cinematography, it is a fairly old film but the most important thing is the story and the acting which remain strong throughout.

    Mad Love stars Chris O Donnell, who sets his sights on high school love, Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, the girl he dates does not come across as the average teenager. She suffers from severe depression and this becomes progressive. The outbursts and mental problems threaten to break up the otherwise close relationship but to his credit, O Donnell sticks by her and his love for her becomes clear. The pair are real opposites but carry a unique love for each other. Leland is the caring, hard-working, clever, shy and conscientious type whilst Roberts is the outgoing, partying and slacking girl, always out for a bit of fun. Its hard for the guy to begin with but he fits the bill perfectly, low-key and probably slightly shy in reality, really does translate well to the big screen. His tentative first steps to love are shown and arguably, there is not really a better talent out there to slip on the shoes of Leland. The relationship becomes frustrating but as with any other romantic drama, there are always strains on the relationship. One tends to feel sorry for O Donnell but at the same time, holds much respect for the guy. This could be a very real situation, minus some of the slightly overblown depressive outbursts from Barrymore. There is also the added say from both parents whilst Donnell tries to keep his feet on the ground with his SAT's and everything but ends up giving way to the girl he loves so much. At the end of the day, there is really no substitute. So, to conclude, O Donnell excels in a masterful albeit low-key role with a half-decent Barrymore to throw in some light-hearted and serious, sad scenes. Not a bad movie at all. 7/10.

    Mad Love success is formally down to the leads Drew Barrymore and Chris O' Donnell. Their chemistry together, their development, twists and turns make you genuinely care about the characters. If that's the only reason you see the film then go right ahead. The subject of Bi-Polar is sensitively approached under the direction of Antonia Bird and I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite coming - of age dramas and made me fall in love with both Barrymore and O'Donnell and follow along on their incredible journey together. Some may guffaw at the cinematography, it is a fairly old film but the most important thing is the story and the acting which remain strong throughout.

    Mad Love stars Chris O Donnell, who sets his sights on high school love, Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, the girl he dates does not come across as the average teenager. She suffers from severe depression and this becomes progressive. The outbursts and mental problems threaten to break up the otherwise close relationship but to his credit, O Donnell sticks by her and his love for her becomes clear. The pair are real opposites but carry a unique love for each other. Leland is the caring, hard-working, clever, shy and conscientious type whilst Roberts is the outgoing, partying and slacking girl, always out for a bit of fun. Its hard for the guy to begin with but he fits the bill perfectly, low-key and probably slightly shy in reality, really does translate well to the big screen. His tentative first steps to love are shown and arguably, there is not really a better talent out there to slip on the shoes of Leland. The relationship becomes frustrating but as with any other romantic drama, there are always strains on the relationship. One tends to feel sorry for O Donnell but at the same time, holds much respect for the guy. This could be a very real situation, minus some of the slightly overblown depressive outbursts from Barrymore. There is also the added say from both parents whilst Donnell tries to keep his feet on the ground with his SAT's and everything but ends up giving way to the girl he loves so much. At the end of the day, there is really no substitute. So, to conclude, O Donnell excels in a masterful albeit low-key role with a half-decent Barrymore to throw in some light-hearted and serious, sad scenes. Not a bad movie at all. 7/10.

    Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse, along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance. I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence (scored with an abominable rock song); unfortunately, it does. Boy meets girl at school, they flirt, they date, they run off together. The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced. It isn't a fresh spin, although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new, and who knows? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments. To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating, not to mention terribly irresponsible, and not quite the "wild and sexy adventure" advertised. NO STARS from ****

    This film feels like an indie set-up but the mainstream stars (Chris O'Donnel and Drew Barrymore) give it a false sense of Hollywood glamour. Donnel's character is as bland as a blancmange, leaving Barrymore to seize centre stage in an even yet watchable performance as a depressed young woman. The problem with the film is we never know why she suffers. Not much is revealed about her parents or her upbringing. The film seems to have lost its way. what should have been a quirky indie film is spoiled by an obtrusive rock soundtrack that mocks the serious subject at hand. The cinematography is pretty poor too. All in all, a wasted opportunity for all concerned.

    I love Drew Barrymore and I've never seen her look more desirable than in this movie. She has short blonde hair and a beautiful smile. Drew is a chick with some kind of mental problem. She soon meets Chris O'Donnell, who decides it would be a good idea to shirk all responsibility to his family in favor of kidnapping Drew and hitting the road as a fugitive. Chris is so dumb, he doesn't leave Seattle for Canada, which is only a few miles north. No, Chris is smarter than that. He heads for Mexico! What a dweeb. The unlikely duo stumbles into a restaurant in Salinas (California) where Drew misses out on the shrimp she ordered so she can go to the toilet, take off the ugly dress Chris bought for her, and crawl around on the floor while checking for a secret door behind the commode. These adventures continue for awhile until Drew comes to her senses and dumps O'Dumbbell. OK for teenyboppers. Others may be bored out of their freaking minds.

    Although in the movie she is diagnosed with clinical depression that is not what the character has. Drew Barrymore's character displays the perfect diagnostic criteria for a Borderline. She is reactive to certain situations and rapidly changes moods with overwhelming emotions, she is exactly like me. *Contains Spoilers* "A pattern of unstable and intense interpersonal relationships characterized by alternating between extremes of idealization and devaluation." In the beginning Drew Barrymore is exciting, interesting, wild, and intense. She falls completely in love with Chis O'Donnell's character and obsessed with him. When he refuses to leave class after she pulls the alarm she doesn't talk to him for days. Their relationship becomes very intense and leads to concern from their parents. Chris really shines in this movie because he plays the perfect responsible and care-giving individual that would be attracted to and give care to Drew. He is innocent and naive which is the type of person a borderline would desire. "Impulsiveness in at least two areas that are potentially self-damaging (e.g., promiscuous sex, eating disorders, binge eating, substance abuse, reckless driving)." This is the most obvious in the movie. She pulls the fire alarm, she takes a trip with Chris to a waterfall during school hours. She jumps into the lake after she and her parents have a fight. She runs away from home with O'Donnell in fear that their parents will send her away and have her leave Chris. She drives recklessly while turning the last minute only to wreck the car. She attacks the driver that picks her up and steals his car. Drives off after she catches Chris talking to her mother in fear that he is trying to abandon her. Smokes cigarettes. I believe because it was a PG rated movie they did not have her do drugs or have sex with many partners. "Recurrent suicidal behavior, gestures, threats or self-injuring behavior such as cutting, interfering with the healing of scars (excoriation) or picking at oneself." She pulls a gun to both of their heads, and attempts suicide. She talks about her parents and her father which makes her upset and she goes into the bathroom and starts crying and having an anxiety attack. Threatens to kill herself and holds a gun to her head. I believe they didn't make her a cutter because of the PG rating. "Affective instability due to a marked reactivity of mood (e.g., intense episodic dysphoria, irritability or anxiety usually lasting a few hours and only rarely more than a few days)." She pastes pictures of dozens of faces from magazines in an insane sort of of way. The episode in the bathroom also. "Chronic feelings of emptiness" Her behavior is an example of her feelings of emptiness. When she calls late at night because she just needed to hear from him. It's hard to explain this but as a borderline myself i did the same thing. It's like you fear the person doesn't love you anymore and you need reassurance constantly. "Inappropriate anger or difficulty controlling anger (e.g., frequent displays of temper, constant anger, recurrent physical fights)." She burns the guy in the car with her cigarette. "Transient, stress-related paranoid idealization, delusions or severe dissociative symptoms." When Chris is selling his telescope for cash she spaces out and experiences a dissociative moment as if she is seeing the world out of herself. This is a good example because of the camera work and score. She believes he doesn't want her anymore just because he calls her parents. "Identity disturbance: markedly and persistently unstable self-image or sense of self." This as with feelings of emptiness, is seen throughout the movie by her behavior in general. I think an example of this is when she posts all of the pictures of women from magazines so they can 'look at her' makes her feel a sense of identity. Over all this movie perfectly shows the personality of a Borderline Personality Disorder sufferer. Medications can't really help other than treating symptoms like depression or anxiety. The affect on the family and boyfriend also show how real life families struggle with a loved one suffers from it. Chris is often walking on eggshells to avoid offending or hurting her. What makes this movie so good is the perfect example of a mental illness. This is a rare thing to seen in movies, usually they mix disorder u p and get them all wrong. I recommend this movie to anyone that suffers from or know someone that suffers from Borderline Personality Disorder. I suffer from it myself and set my first boyfriend through the ringer like she did. Once I found out what it was, well now I know what i have and am getting the right treatment for it.

    I can't fathom why so many people have called this a "romantic comedy". It is in no way a comedy and while there is a romance that carries along with it, the plot isn't about the romance. It's about mental illness and how it affects the person and those around them. It felt like the ending as intended was when the doors closed behind Drew's character as she entered the hospital. The narrated ending seems tacked on, probably had too many people at the screenings that didn't care for whatever was the original ending. The studio perhaps felt pressure to make it a bit more upbeat and hopeful. I didn't mind an upbeat ending too much though, I'm generally a sucker for "Hollywood" endings. Plus it didn't seem to take away anything from her suffering. She's doing better with the help of doctors, not magically cured. As for Chris O'Donnell's performance, I thought it was fine. He didn't stand out and I don't think he was supposed to. His character was supposed to be a bit shy and geeky. This was obvious from the scenes leading up to him talking to Drew's character. As a disclaimer I like Drew Barrymore in everything I've seen her in, not necessarily the movie, but her performance at least. This has to be not only one of her best performances but one of the best performances in a film period. Yes, a lot of people would disagree with me but for anyone who has known someone suffering from depression and especially bi-polar disorder I think they'd agree she portrayed it amazingly well.

    This is a love story, of sorts, which conflicts the viewer in that it tenderly presents this tragic heroine and then shocks the audience by eloquently demonstrating the ins and outs of the moderate-to-severe bi-polar disorder, with which the heroine attempts to live. (The mother states her daughter suffers from depression, but Drew's depiction does NOT indicate depression alone. There are extreme highs and bottom-dipping lows, which would be more indicative of manic depression or bi-polar disorder than depression alone. Not to minimize the life-changing effects of clinical or chemical depression, because I'm not.) Drew generates a stellar performance here, and fully sells the range of emotions her character experiences. Her portrayal is dead on perfect; in not just the disease itself, but her depth and range here is nothing short of phenomenal. Chris O'Donnell is not as lacking as some would make one believe. He contributes an adequate performance as a young man without a clue; therefore, his character is vastly disliked because he comes off as clueless, and movie-goers associated him with the character. Go figure. This work is seriously underrated, primarily due to the unsatisfactorily heart-wrenching ending, but also due to the audiences inability to conceive of Drew as anything but bubbly and intelligent. She customarily takes parts in which her character is put in a sweet (if rose-colored) light, whereas her role herein is quite edgy and tragic. The screenplay itself is not solid. The flux is very fluid within this story. The only solid thing here are the performances by Drew and Chris, and the profound sadness and sense of loss experienced by its viewers via the execution of the story line. I actually enjoyed this, though the ending IS unsettling and fails to satisfy. It rates an 8.4/10 from... the Fiend :.

    This is the classic tale of young love gone all wrong. Bad girl, Casey (Drew Barrymore) good guy (Chris ODonnell) fall MADLY in love with one another. She's got problems(oppressive parents, emotionally disturbed). Naturally, after she creates a series of events that screw up Matt's plans for the future & both sets of parents forbid their relationship, they RUN away together. All is going well & good until Casey completely loses it.....But the END of the movie is what satisfies. It's not your usual tragic tale with a happy ending that you're always hoping for & expecting. & as always...a great soundtrack does a lot for a movie. If you're into the early 90's grunge movement/alternative rock deal, you'll love the music & the scene with the band, Seven Year Bitch. They rock!

    Mad Love success is formally down to the leads Drew Barrymore and Chris O' Donnell. Their chemistry together, their development, twists and turns make you genuinely care about the characters. If that's the only reason you see the film then go right ahead. The subject of Bi-Polar is sensitively approached under the direction of Antonia Bird and I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite coming - of age dramas and made me fall in love with both Barrymore and O'Donnell and follow along on their incredible journey together. Some may guffaw at the cinematography, it is a fairly old film but the most important thing is the story and the acting which remain strong throughout.

    This is the classic tale of young love gone all wrong. Bad girl, Casey (Drew Barrymore) good guy (Chris ODonnell) fall MADLY in love with one another. She's got problems(oppressive parents, emotionally disturbed). Naturally, after she creates a series of events that screw up Matt's plans for the future & both sets of parents forbid their relationship, they RUN away together. All is going well & good until Casey completely loses it.....But the END of the movie is what satisfies. It's not your usual tragic tale with a happy ending that you're always hoping for & expecting. & as always...a great soundtrack does a lot for a movie. If you're into the early 90's grunge movement/alternative rock deal, you'll love the music & the scene with the band, Seven Year Bitch. They rock!

    Mad Love success is formally down to the leads Drew Barrymore and Chris O' Donnell. Their chemistry together, their development, twists and turns make you genuinely care about the characters. If that's the only reason you see the film then go right ahead. The subject of Bi-Polar is sensitively approached under the direction of Antonia Bird and I can honestly say that this is one of my favourite coming - of age dramas and made me fall in love with both Barrymore and O'Donnell and follow along on their incredible journey together. Some may guffaw at the cinematography, it is a fairly old film but the most important thing is the story and the acting which remain strong throughout.

    Mad Love stars Chris O Donnell, who sets his sights on high school love, Drew Barrymore. Unfortunately, the girl he dates does not come across as the average teenager. She suffers from severe depression and this becomes progressive. The outbursts and mental problems threaten to break up the otherwise close relationship but to his credit, O Donnell sticks by her and his love for her becomes clear. The pair are real opposites but carry a unique love for each other. Leland is the caring, hard-working, clever, shy and conscientious type whilst Roberts is the outgoing, partying and slacking girl, always out for a bit of fun. Its hard for the guy to begin with but he fits the bill perfectly, low-key and probably slightly shy in reality, really does translate well to the big screen. His tentative first steps to love are shown and arguably, there is not really a better talent out there to slip on the shoes of Leland. The relationship becomes frustrating but as with any other romantic drama, there are always strains on the relationship. One tends to feel sorry for O Donnell but at the same time, holds much respect for the guy. This could be a very real situation, minus some of the slightly overblown depressive outbursts from Barrymore. There is also the added say from both parents whilst Donnell tries to keep his feet on the ground with his SAT's and everything but ends up giving way to the girl he loves so much. At the end of the day, there is really no substitute. So, to conclude, O Donnell excels in a masterful albeit low-key role with a half-decent Barrymore to throw in some light-hearted and serious, sad scenes. Not a bad movie at all. 7/10.

    Just when you thought movies in the 1990s couldn't get any worse, along comes this lumpy stew of a teen romance. I wasn't sure the picture could actually sink any lower from the ludicrous opening sequence (scored with an abominable rock song); unfortunately, it does. Boy meets girl at school, they flirt, they date, they run off together. The conceit here is that she's mentally unbalanced. It isn't a fresh spin, although the filmmakers and the cast proceed like they're doing something new, and who knows? Maybe the young audience targeted for the picture actually believe in its sentiments. To all of us over 30 it's pretty excruciating, not to mention terribly irresponsible, and not quite the "wild and sexy adventure" advertised. NO STARS from ****

    This film feels like an indie set-up but the mainstream stars (Chris O'Donnel and Drew Barrymore) give it a false sense of Hollywood glamour. Donnel's character is as bland as a blancmange, leaving Barrymore to seize centre stage in an even yet watchable performance as a depressed young woman. The problem with the film is we never know why she suffers. Not much is revealed about her parents or her upbringing. The film seems to have lost its way. what should have been a quirky indie film is spoiled by an obtrusive rock soundtrack that mocks the serious subject at hand. The cinematography is pretty poor too. All in all, a wasted opportunity for all concerned.
