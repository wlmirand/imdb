    Jury Duty not only stalls the fictional trial it's based around, but it too seems like it stalls the flow and speed of the film. It's like we have to wait so the movie can catch up. If you've seen detective, mystery, criminal, or investigations shows this shouldn't be very difficult to piece together. I was able to point out the suspicious one, and come to a consensus on the trial in about forty minutes. Not a very complex film. Once more, we have Pauly Shore, who's fine in this film. I didn't adore him in this film, and it does not come close to the humor brought to us in Bio-Dome. I think In the Army Now is better than this as well. Jury Duty doesn't exceed the average/below average qualities it should to be unique or special. It does exactly what it's expected to do. Like a little kid on his way to the market because his parents said so. He walks straight to the market, and straight back. Doesn't stop and chat, doesn't smell the daisies, and doesn't lollygag. Nothing out of his expectations. Pauly Shore is lovable loser Tommy Collins who is in desperate need of money and a job. He is stuck at his parent's house with his dog Peanut, and his dignity deteriorating day by day. Tommy is called on jury duty, and like everything else in his life, he's hesitate on following through with it. Until he learns that the duty pays $5 a day, and there's a hotel in it for him as well. A few hours of sitting and listening to go back to a hotel, all for $5 a day? Why not? As you would imagine, Tommy doesn't want to give this up. He meets a sexy juror (Tia Carrere) who he is friendly too, but she wants nothing to do with him. Tommy gets the idea that if he continues to stall the trial, by voting "not guilty" every time, he can pretty much get $5 a day for doing nothing but expressing his false opinion. Ingenious! The film has taking a good beating by Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin. I enjoy Pauly Shore, but didn't find this film too funny. Some parts I smiled or laughed, but as a comedy, it greatly fails at it's job - to make the audience laugh. If a comedy doesn't make the audience laugh, it's practically as lifeless as a soap opera drama. Just characters with no purpose. To date, this is the worst Pauly Shore film I've seen. Too bad. This could've been a very enjoyable film, but the film just doesn't feel like trying to be original. It just thinks that it can get by by being the simplest it can possibly be without failing. If only the film would experience a little, and realize it's a comedy film where possibilities are endless, it's critical and audience reception wouldn't be so sour. Starring: Pauly Shore, Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray, Shelley Winters, Abe Vigoda, and Billie Bird. Directed by: John Fortenberry.

    UGH! What a waste of time this was. Pauly Shore hit a professional low with this regurgitated from hells cinema's anus stink bomb. I could belabor you with all of what is wrong with this film but I decided that maybe I could focus on the few good aspects of "Jury Duty". Yeah, thats the way to go. So, without further ado, um....I....um....Na, sorry I tried but even manure with sprinkles is still manure. Pauly Shore movies were always exercises in irritation. You sit their asking yourself from the first reel, "Why am I watching this?" "Why did I waste my money on this?" Personally, I think its like a train wreck. You know its gonna be ugly and hard to look at but you just have to see how bad it can possibly be. Jury Duty has Shore as a loser-bum that refuses to get a real job and wants to get on a jury for as long as possible so he can have free room and board for as long as a trial can last. So of course he does anything to drag the case out. Wacky premise, huh, I was so disgusted at this movies lame attempts at humor that I bailed out 30 minutes in. From what I heard it didn't get any better as the movie progressed. In conclusion: Avoid like the freaking plague.

    In my opinion the Jury Duty isn't as bad as people say/write - I actually liked the idea for the script, but the main problem is... the main actor. I just can't stand Pauly Shore's overacting in any of his movies, which is sad that he spoiled this promising idea with his lack of skills. I mean what bad can be said about Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray or Abe Vigoda? They all are great, but why oh why they had to hire Pauly Shore? They could hire anyone (well, almost anyone, I don't think Rob Schneider or Adam Baldwin would make much good) in his place and the project would turn out well.

    This is a movie starring Pauly Shore while his finest hour (or accurately his 15 min of fame!). And it's not complicated to review. Good things : 1_Pauly Shore, doing his thing. And it wasn't a bad thing at all. 2_The script. It's kind of brilliant, being a nice far spoof of 12 Angry Men, giving us small world, nice plot, and hot climax. 3_Tia Carrere; back when she was smoking HOT. Despite how they didn't go and show well all of her capacities (Shore's fantasies are so lame !). 4_The last 10 minutes. They were close to perfect. 5_The innocent feel of it. I mean look at the gags, there is No bad tasting, toilet humor,..etc. It's all plain fun. 6_Moments like messing with the accused in the court, the way how the lead approved his point about guiltlessness, playing the original "S.W.A.T" music while running to Carrere, or Shore's Chihuahua watching TV. 7_The minor parts were played by lovely actors. 8_The song by the end of the movie. 9_I was about putting this in the "bad things" section : Portraying the ones who love and care about environment as lunatic serial killers. The reason I didn't is that I'm one of these people, though I laughed my heart out with Stanley Tucci going bananas over Asbestos! 10_The fact that TV is airing it a lot. I watched 3 times till now. Bad things : 1_Pauly Shore dressed as a whore. Just Yuck !! 2_ Shore's striptease. Just NOOOO! 3_Shore spoofing coldly Al Pacino in (And Justice for All). Wasn't a good move-ito pal-ito. 4_The weakness of the lead's main goal. I couldn't wholly buy how all what he wanted was the petty paycheck and living in a good room ! 5_I don't think that the hotel we watched needed desperately this publicity from the lead. There must have been more powerful reason for giving this deluxe room for him. So 5 bad vs. 10 good. Namely for every bad thing there are 2 good things to keep the sweetness up. Accordingly this is a good movie. Rather an average low budget comedy (to be sadistically objective !). Nothing wrong with light time, and this one provides that for harmless 88 minutes. Though the thing that I hated, wanting to put it in the "very bad things" section, is the way Pauly Shore and his movies were BANNED! I do not know at all how he wasn't forgiven for being himself in 5 movies he made, that's his all cinematic career to date by the way, while for instance Jim Carrey was for horrible disgusting trash he did one after another at his start, at the mid-90s too, such as (Dumb & Dumber), (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls), (The Cable Guy) and (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) ??? Simply the major studios gave (Carrey) millions, while not giving Shore even a second chance. In the same time Adam Sandler acted as nothing but the same idiot fool for his first 10 movies and he got a career out of it. While Chris Tucker is known as unbearable, he had the opportunity to make Rush Hour 1,2, and 3 ?!! Steve Martin became not funny anymore, nevertheless they made him the new Pink Panther in not one but 2 movies ?!! In fact the list is long, yet with no (Shore) in it ?! If you think "unfair" already then you haven't heard Gene Siskel saying, in 1995, that (Shore) is annoying but not strategically annoying like Jim Carrey (HUH ??!!), or Roger Ebert saying that watching Jury Duty is like hearing long fingernails scratching a piece of glass for long time. Well, Roger, that's exactly what I feel while watching 2001 Space Odyssey, not Jury Duty ! The deduction : Not everyone loves Pauly Shore. However, he didn't have much time to develop, be different, or assure that he has good things, as the time some other actors apparently had to do the same. In any case still (Jury Duty) is : A Pauly Shore Classic. Cute unpretentious fun. "Bad" or "so Bad" are only what I call many of its reviews. Plus it's somehow a rare chance to watch a work of a comedian who his career by now has gone with the wind, and what a strange wind that was! By the way it's : "Judge-ito have a bite of my burrito, Ato have some of my tomato, Mr. Cockthrow have some of my...OK I won't say that one.".

    I'm not a hater of Pauly Shore by any means, he can be a very funny guy and I rather liked Biodome which came after this film. But this one really stretched Shore's smart aleck personality way too far. Jury Duty is now something I try to avoid figuring that back in the day I served on three of them at one time or another. And the next time I'm eligible I would be over 70 years old and would get an automatic exemption should I choose. But if you have nothing else to do, your life isn't going anywhere, why not take that magnificent sum of $5.00 a day for service. That's what Shore figures when his mother Shelley Winters and her long time boyfriend Charles Napier get married and he's at loose ends. And wouldn't you know it, he gets on the jury of an accused serial killer, Sean Whalen. Shore however finds a way to make Jury Duty not only profitable, but quite comfortable. Whalen is accused of butchering and dismembering several fast food managers when he's found sleeping at the place their bodies were stashed. If he didn't do it his hopes for justice rest on the shoulders of Pauly Shore a fate I'd not wish on anyone. Pauly gets way too over the top in Jury Duty and you'd better like him if you have any hopes of liking this film. Also I just can't believe that fellow juror Tia Carrere would ever fall for someone like Shore. But that's movie magic for you. Among other places Pauly takes his cues from is that flawed classic 12 Angry Men. When I reviewed that I said that Henry Fonda's actions, one in particular would have been grounds for a mistrial. Ironically because of what Shore does, Judge Abe Vigoda does declare a mistrial. Justice does get served in a highly unusual manner. If that pleases you by all means see Jury Duty. Otherwise people who are not Pauly Shore's fans will have a hard time with this film.

    Tommy still lives with his parents in a trailer park. He's trying to improve himself, but his parents aren't really pushing him. Though Tommy's father has a dream: collect styrofoam, no matter how dirty, from all the dumpsters and landfills he and Tommy can find, clean it, and recycle it. Oh, yeah, that's the way to live. One possible job for Tommy: a stripper at the club where his Uncle Sal works. Sal gives him a chance because he's family, but he just hasn't got the talent. Or the body. Then comes the terrible news: Tommy's parents are finally going to get married. In Las Vegas. But where will he live until they return? The couple who will take care of him are even worse than being homeless. But wait! That notice Tommy got in the mail about being called for jury duty. He can make a little money doing that, if it's a long trial. And he has to make sure to get a case where he gets sequestered. And, oh yeah, in nearly all situations like this ... do I really have to say what's going to happen? And the defendant is an accused serial killer who one can't possibly like, with an incompetent lawyer. One more detail: Although he ends up in a suite with the principal who expelled him from high school and still hates him--and keeps him up all night listening to motivational tapes--Tommy manages to con the hotel into giving him the best accommodations he can ask for! How have I never seen this? I love Pauly Shore movies. Actually, Shore didn't have quite the edge that I'm used to in this one. He had some great moments when he was trying to make sure he didn't get on the wrong kind of jury, and toward the end he really does a good job, considering he's Pauly Shore. I was concerned at one point, but the last 20 minutes or so make this movie really worth seeing. Sure, the writers have no concept of what would be legally permissible, and the number of offenses by jurors and other participants that could have resulted in a mistrial or contempt charges would fill a filing cabinet. But it's all entertaining. Eventually. Tia Carrere is really pretty and she has some good scenes. But it's hard to believe from his performance here that Abe Vigoda was ever part of such a respected show as "Barney Miller". You pretty much have to like Adam Sandler and Pauly Shore to like a movie of this type.

    I am sure that there is someone out there in movie audiences that like Pauly Shore. I mean, he has to have made something worth watching, right? Well, it certainly wasn't this movie. Except for Tia Carrere, there really isn't anything to see here. The concept is innovative, I have to admit. Made homeless, he gets on jury duty in a murder case to get sequestered, and he keeps the jury going (Spoof of 12 Angry Men?)to keep a roof over his head. But even the murderer (Sean Whalen) gets irritated. I got irritated long before that. Well, let's just wait for the next Pauly Shore venture with American Idol, Ruben Studdard. I am sure it will be as good as this one.

    i saw this movie on a DVD last night and the movie reminded me of a Bollywood film named "EK RUKA HUA FAISLA" which means A PENDING VERDICT. jury duty is a total rip off from this movie. but the Hindi flick was far better scripted and it was brilliantly acted by some of the most talented actors Indian film industry has. if you ppl don't believe wat has been written then check out this link.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157571/. the Hindi movie was released in 1986 whereas jury duty in 1995. so at last we have a Hollywood film ripping ideas from a bollywood(i prefer to call it the Hindi film industry). and it was done way back in the eighties!!!! so guys please for one time spare the poor bollywood film makers guilty of lifting off ideas from Hollywood .

    There is a scene early on in "Jury Duty" when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents, however, he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. "Jury Duty" is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie, he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid, Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in Bio-Dome. Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like "In the Army Now," but close. There is little originality to the script, no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny. Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all, more or less, bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful "Jerk" character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you. Of course, not all the blame can be put on his shoulders. He has no script to work with. Nothing. I don't know why Stanley Tucci thought this movie would be good for him and or how the studio blackmailed him into being in it. I remembered both "Encino Man" and "Son in Law" were kind of funny in a stupid way. "Jury Duty " on the other hand is stupid in a very unfunny way.

    First of I want to point out that I like Pauley Shore and have enjoyed watching other comedy movies that he starred in and but I just didn't like Jury Duty and didn't find the humor to be that funny and it was kind of boring and a let down compared to Bio-Dome and other Pauley Shore movies! I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it! This movie just didn't appeal to me at all! I would recommend people rent this before buying or try to watch it on TV first!

If you think "unfair" already then you haven't heard Gene Siskel saying, in 1995, that (Shore) is annoying but not strategically annoying like Jim Carrey (HUH ??!!), or Roger Ebert saying that watching Jury Duty is like hearing long fingernails scratching a piece of glass for long time. Well, Roger, that's exactly what I feel while watching 2001 Space Odyssey, not Jury Duty ! The deduction : Not everyone loves Pauly Shore. However, he didn't have much time to develop, be different, or assure that he has good things, as the time some other actors apparently had to do the same. In any case still (Jury Duty) is : A Pauly Shore Classic. Cute unpretentious fun. "Bad" or "so Bad" are only what I call many of its reviews. Plus it's somehow a rare chance to watch a work of a comedian who his career by now has gone with the wind, and what a strange wind that was! By the way it's : "Judge-ito have a bite of my burrito, Ato have some of my tomato, Mr. Cockthrow have some of my...OK I won't say that one.".

    I'm not a hater of Pauly Shore by any means, he can be a very funny guy and I rather liked Biodome which came after this film. But this one really stretched Shore's smart aleck personality way too far. Jury Duty is now something I try to avoid figuring that back in the day I served on three of them at one time or another. And the next time I'm eligible I would be over 70 years old and would get an automatic exemption should I choose. But if you have nothing else to do, your life isn't going anywhere, why not take that magnificent sum of $5.00 a day for service. That's what Shore figures when his mother Shelley Winters and her long time boyfriend Charles Napier get married and he's at loose ends. And wouldn't you know it, he gets on the jury of an accused serial killer, Sean Whalen. Shore however finds a way to make Jury Duty not only profitable, but quite comfortable. Whalen is accused of butchering and dismembering several fast food managers when he's found sleeping at the place their bodies were stashed. If he didn't do it his hopes for justice rest on the shoulders of Pauly Shore a fate I'd not wish on anyone. Pauly gets way too over the top in Jury Duty and you'd better like him if you have any hopes of liking this film. Also I just can't believe that fellow juror Tia Carrere would ever fall for someone like Shore. But that's movie magic for you. Among other places Pauly takes his cues from is that flawed classic 12 Angry Men. When I reviewed that I said that Henry Fonda's actions, one in particular would have been grounds for a mistrial. Ironically because of what Shore does, Judge Abe Vigoda does declare a mistrial. Justice does get served in a highly unusual manner. If that pleases you by all means see Jury Duty. Otherwise people who are not Pauly Shore's fans will have a hard time with this film.

    Tommy still lives with his parents in a trailer park. He's trying to improve himself, but his parents aren't really pushing him. Though Tommy's father has a dream: collect styrofoam, no matter how dirty, from all the dumpsters and landfills he and Tommy can find, clean it, and recycle it. Oh, yeah, that's the way to live. One possible job for Tommy: a stripper at the club where his Uncle Sal works. Sal gives him a chance because he's family, but he just hasn't got the talent. Or the body. Then comes the terrible news: Tommy's parents are finally going to get married. In Las Vegas. But where will he live until they return? The couple who will take care of him are even worse than being homeless. But wait! That notice Tommy got in the mail about being called for jury duty. He can make a little money doing that, if it's a long trial. And he has to make sure to get a case where he gets sequestered. And, oh yeah, in nearly all situations like this ... do I really have to say what's going to happen? And the defendant is an accused serial killer who one can't possibly like, with an incompetent lawyer. One more detail: Although he ends up in a suite with the principal who expelled him from high school and still hates him--and keeps him up all night listening to motivational tapes--Tommy manages to con the hotel into giving him the best accommodations he can ask for! How have I never seen this? I love Pauly Shore movies. Actually, Shore didn't have quite the edge that I'm used to in this one. He had some great moments when he was trying to make sure he didn't get on the wrong kind of jury, and toward the end he really does a good job, considering he's Pauly Shore. I was concerned at one point, but the last 20 minutes or so make this movie really worth seeing. Sure, the writers have no concept of what would be legally permissible, and the number of offenses by jurors and other participants that could have resulted in a mistrial or contempt charges would fill a filing cabinet. But it's all entertaining. Eventually. Tia Carrere is really pretty and she has some good scenes. But it's hard to believe from his performance here that Abe Vigoda was ever part of such a respected show as "Barney Miller". You pretty much have to like Adam Sandler and Pauly Shore to like a movie of this type.

    I am sure that there is someone out there in movie audiences that like Pauly Shore. I mean, he has to have made something worth watching, right? Well, it certainly wasn't this movie. Except for Tia Carrere, there really isn't anything to see here. The concept is innovative, I have to admit. Made homeless, he gets on jury duty in a murder case to get sequestered, and he keeps the jury going (Spoof of 12 Angry Men?)to keep a roof over his head. But even the murderer (Sean Whalen) gets irritated. I got irritated long before that. Well, let's just wait for the next Pauly Shore venture with American Idol, Ruben Studdard. I am sure it will be as good as this one.

    i saw this movie on a DVD last night and the movie reminded me of a Bollywood film named "EK RUKA HUA FAISLA" which means A PENDING VERDICT. jury duty is a total rip off from this movie. but the Hindi flick was far better scripted and it was brilliantly acted by some of the most talented actors Indian film industry has. if you ppl don't believe wat has been written then check out this link.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157571/. the Hindi movie was released in 1986 whereas jury duty in 1995. so at last we have a Hollywood film ripping ideas from a bollywood(i prefer to call it the Hindi film industry). and it was done way back in the eighties!!!! so guys please for one time spare the poor bollywood film makers guilty of lifting off ideas from Hollywood .

    There is a scene early on in "Jury Duty" when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents, however, he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. "Jury Duty" is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie, he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid, Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in Bio-Dome. Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like "In the Army Now," but close. There is little originality to the script, no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny. Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all, more or less, bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful "Jerk" character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you. Of course, not all the blame can be put on his shoulders. He has no script to work with. Nothing. I don't know why Stanley Tucci thought this movie would be good for him and or how the studio blackmailed him into being in it. I remembered both "Encino Man" and "Son in Law" were kind of funny in a stupid way. "Jury Duty " on the other hand is stupid in a very unfunny way.

    First of I want to point out that I like Pauley Shore and have enjoyed watching other comedy movies that he starred in and but I just didn't like Jury Duty and didn't find the humor to be that funny and it was kind of boring and a let down compared to Bio-Dome and other Pauley Shore movies! I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it! This movie just didn't appeal to me at all! I would recommend people rent this before buying or try to watch it on TV first!

    Jury Duty not only stalls the fictional trial it's based around, but it too seems like it stalls the flow and speed of the film. It's like we have to wait so the movie can catch up. If you've seen detective, mystery, criminal, or investigations shows this shouldn't be very difficult to piece together. I was able to point out the suspicious one, and come to a consensus on the trial in about forty minutes. Not a very complex film. Once more, we have Pauly Shore, who's fine in this film. I didn't adore him in this film, and it does not come close to the humor brought to us in Bio-Dome. I think In the Army Now is better than this as well. Jury Duty doesn't exceed the average/below average qualities it should to be unique or special. It does exactly what it's expected to do. Like a little kid on his way to the market because his parents said so. He walks straight to the market, and straight back. Doesn't stop and chat, doesn't smell the daisies, and doesn't lollygag. Nothing out of his expectations. Pauly Shore is lovable loser Tommy Collins who is in desperate need of money and a job. He is stuck at his parent's house with his dog Peanut, and his dignity deteriorating day by day. Tommy is called on jury duty, and like everything else in his life, he's hesitate on following through with it. Until he learns that the duty pays $5 a day, and there's a hotel in it for him as well. A few hours of sitting and listening to go back to a hotel, all for $5 a day? Why not? As you would imagine, Tommy doesn't want to give this up. He meets a sexy juror (Tia Carrere) who he is friendly too, but she wants nothing to do with him. Tommy gets the idea that if he continues to stall the trial, by voting "not guilty" every time, he can pretty much get $5 a day for doing nothing but expressing his false opinion. Ingenious! The film has taking a good beating by Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin. I enjoy Pauly Shore, but didn't find this film too funny. Some parts I smiled or laughed, but as a comedy, it greatly fails at it's job - to make the audience laugh. If a comedy doesn't make the audience laugh, it's practically as lifeless as a soap opera drama. Just characters with no purpose. To date, this is the worst Pauly Shore film I've seen. Too bad. This could've been a very enjoyable film, but the film just doesn't feel like trying to be original. It just thinks that it can get by by being the simplest it can possibly be without failing. If only the film would experience a little, and realize it's a comedy film where possibilities are endless, it's critical and audience reception wouldn't be so sour. Starring: Pauly Shore, Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray, Shelley Winters, Abe Vigoda, and Billie Bird. Directed by: John Fortenberry.

    UGH! What a waste of time this was. Pauly Shore hit a professional low with this regurgitated from hells cinema's anus stink bomb. I could belabor you with all of what is wrong with this film but I decided that maybe I could focus on the few good aspects of "Jury Duty". Yeah, thats the way to go. So, without further ado, um....I....um....Na, sorry I tried but even manure with sprinkles is still manure. Pauly Shore movies were always exercises in irritation. You sit their asking yourself from the first reel, "Why am I watching this?" "Why did I waste my money on this?" Personally, I think its like a train wreck. You know its gonna be ugly and hard to look at but you just have to see how bad it can possibly be. Jury Duty has Shore as a loser-bum that refuses to get a real job and wants to get on a jury for as long as possible so he can have free room and board for as long as a trial can last. So of course he does anything to drag the case out. Wacky premise, huh, I was so disgusted at this movies lame attempts at humor that I bailed out 30 minutes in. From what I heard it didn't get any better as the movie progressed. In conclusion: Avoid like the freaking plague.

    In my opinion the Jury Duty isn't as bad as people say/write - I actually liked the idea for the script, but the main problem is... the main actor. I just can't stand Pauly Shore's overacting in any of his movies, which is sad that he spoiled this promising idea with his lack of skills. I mean what bad can be said about Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray or Abe Vigoda? They all are great, but why oh why they had to hire Pauly Shore? They could hire anyone (well, almost anyone, I don't think Rob Schneider or Adam Baldwin would make much good) in his place and the project would turn out well.

    This is a movie starring Pauly Shore while his finest hour (or accurately his 15 min of fame!). And it's not complicated to review. Good things : 1_Pauly Shore, doing his thing. And it wasn't a bad thing at all. 2_The script. It's kind of brilliant, being a nice far spoof of 12 Angry Men, giving us small world, nice plot, and hot climax. 3_Tia Carrere; back when she was smoking HOT. Despite how they didn't go and show well all of her capacities (Shore's fantasies are so lame !). 4_The last 10 minutes. They were close to perfect. 5_The innocent feel of it. I mean look at the gags, there is No bad tasting, toilet humor,..etc. It's all plain fun. 6_Moments like messing with the accused in the court, the way how the lead approved his point about guiltlessness, playing the original "S.W.A.T" music while running to Carrere, or Shore's Chihuahua watching TV. 7_The minor parts were played by lovely actors. 8_The song by the end of the movie. 9_I was about putting this in the "bad things" section : Portraying the ones who love and care about environment as lunatic serial killers. The reason I didn't is that I'm one of these people, though I laughed my heart out with Stanley Tucci going bananas over Asbestos! 10_The fact that TV is airing it a lot. I watched 3 times till now. Bad things : 1_Pauly Shore dressed as a whore. Just Yuck !! 2_ Shore's striptease. Just NOOOO! 3_Shore spoofing coldly Al Pacino in (And Justice for All). Wasn't a good move-ito pal-ito. 4_The weakness of the lead's main goal. I couldn't wholly buy how all what he wanted was the petty paycheck and living in a good room ! 5_I don't think that the hotel we watched needed desperately this publicity from the lead. There must have been more powerful reason for giving this deluxe room for him. So 5 bad vs. 10 good. Namely for every bad thing there are 2 good things to keep the sweetness up. Accordingly this is a good movie. Rather an average low budget comedy (to be sadistically objective !). Nothing wrong with light time, and this one provides that for harmless 88 minutes. Though the thing that I hated, wanting to put it in the "very bad things" section, is the way Pauly Shore and his movies were BANNED! I do not know at all how he wasn't forgiven for being himself in 5 movies he made, that's his all cinematic career to date by the way, while for instance Jim Carrey was for horrible disgusting trash he did one after another at his start, at the mid-90s too, such as (Dumb & Dumber), (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls), (The Cable Guy) and (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) ??? Simply the major studios gave (Carrey) millions, while not giving Shore even a second chance. In the same time Adam Sandler acted as nothing but the same idiot fool for his first 10 movies and he got a career out of it. While Chris Tucker is known as unbearable, he had the opportunity to make Rush Hour 1,2, and 3 ?!! Steve Martin became not funny anymore, nevertheless they made him the new Pink Panther in not one but 2 movies ?!! In fact the list is long, yet with no (Shore) in it ?! If you think "unfair" already then you haven't heard Gene Siskel saying, in 1995, that (Shore) is annoying but not strategically annoying like Jim Carrey (HUH ??!!), or Roger Ebert saying that watching Jury Duty is like hearing long fingernails scratching a piece of glass for long time.

    Jury Duty not only stalls the fictional trial it's based around, but it too seems like it stalls the flow and speed of the film. It's like we have to wait so the movie can catch up. If you've seen detective, mystery, criminal, or investigations shows this shouldn't be very difficult to piece together. I was able to point out the suspicious one, and come to a consensus on the trial in about forty minutes. Not a very complex film. Once more, we have Pauly Shore, who's fine in this film. I didn't adore him in this film, and it does not come close to the humor brought to us in Bio-Dome. I think In the Army Now is better than this as well. Jury Duty doesn't exceed the average/below average qualities it should to be unique or special. It does exactly what it's expected to do. Like a little kid on his way to the market because his parents said so. He walks straight to the market, and straight back. Doesn't stop and chat, doesn't smell the daisies, and doesn't lollygag. Nothing out of his expectations. Pauly Shore is lovable loser Tommy Collins who is in desperate need of money and a job. He is stuck at his parent's house with his dog Peanut, and his dignity deteriorating day by day. Tommy is called on jury duty, and like everything else in his life, he's hesitate on following through with it. Until he learns that the duty pays $5 a day, and there's a hotel in it for him as well. A few hours of sitting and listening to go back to a hotel, all for $5 a day? Why not? As you would imagine, Tommy doesn't want to give this up. He meets a sexy juror (Tia Carrere) who he is friendly too, but she wants nothing to do with him. Tommy gets the idea that if he continues to stall the trial, by voting "not guilty" every time, he can pretty much get $5 a day for doing nothing but expressing his false opinion. Ingenious! The film has taking a good beating by Gene Siskel, Roger Ebert, and Leonard Maltin. I enjoy Pauly Shore, but didn't find this film too funny. Some parts I smiled or laughed, but as a comedy, it greatly fails at it's job - to make the audience laugh. If a comedy doesn't make the audience laugh, it's practically as lifeless as a soap opera drama. Just characters with no purpose. To date, this is the worst Pauly Shore film I've seen. Too bad. This could've been a very enjoyable film, but the film just doesn't feel like trying to be original. It just thinks that it can get by by being the simplest it can possibly be without failing. If only the film would experience a little, and realize it's a comedy film where possibilities are endless, it's critical and audience reception wouldn't be so sour. Starring: Pauly Shore, Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray, Shelley Winters, Abe Vigoda, and Billie Bird. Directed by: John Fortenberry.

    UGH! What a waste of time this was. Pauly Shore hit a professional low with this regurgitated from hells cinema's anus stink bomb. I could belabor you with all of what is wrong with this film but I decided that maybe I could focus on the few good aspects of "Jury Duty". Yeah, thats the way to go. So, without further ado, um....I....um....Na, sorry I tried but even manure with sprinkles is still manure. Pauly Shore movies were always exercises in irritation. You sit their asking yourself from the first reel, "Why am I watching this?" "Why did I waste my money on this?" Personally, I think its like a train wreck. You know its gonna be ugly and hard to look at but you just have to see how bad it can possibly be. Jury Duty has Shore as a loser-bum that refuses to get a real job and wants to get on a jury for as long as possible so he can have free room and board for as long as a trial can last. So of course he does anything to drag the case out. Wacky premise, huh, I was so disgusted at this movies lame attempts at humor that I bailed out 30 minutes in. From what I heard it didn't get any better as the movie progressed. In conclusion: Avoid like the freaking plague.

    In my opinion the Jury Duty isn't as bad as people say/write - I actually liked the idea for the script, but the main problem is... the main actor. I just can't stand Pauly Shore's overacting in any of his movies, which is sad that he spoiled this promising idea with his lack of skills. I mean what bad can be said about Tia Carrere, Stanley Tucci, Brian Doyle-Murray or Abe Vigoda? They all are great, but why oh why they had to hire Pauly Shore? They could hire anyone (well, almost anyone, I don't think Rob Schneider or Adam Baldwin would make much good) in his place and the project would turn out well.

    This is a movie starring Pauly Shore while his finest hour (or accurately his 15 min of fame!). And it's not complicated to review. Good things : 1_Pauly Shore, doing his thing. And it wasn't a bad thing at all. 2_The script. It's kind of brilliant, being a nice far spoof of 12 Angry Men, giving us small world, nice plot, and hot climax. 3_Tia Carrere; back when she was smoking HOT. Despite how they didn't go and show well all of her capacities (Shore's fantasies are so lame !). 4_The last 10 minutes. They were close to perfect. 5_The innocent feel of it. I mean look at the gags, there is No bad tasting, toilet humor,..etc. It's all plain fun. 6_Moments like messing with the accused in the court, the way how the lead approved his point about guiltlessness, playing the original "S.W.A.T" music while running to Carrere, or Shore's Chihuahua watching TV. 7_The minor parts were played by lovely actors. 8_The song by the end of the movie. 9_I was about putting this in the "bad things" section : Portraying the ones who love and care about environment as lunatic serial killers. The reason I didn't is that I'm one of these people, though I laughed my heart out with Stanley Tucci going bananas over Asbestos! 10_The fact that TV is airing it a lot. I watched 3 times till now. Bad things : 1_Pauly Shore dressed as a whore. Just Yuck !! 2_ Shore's striptease. Just NOOOO! 3_Shore spoofing coldly Al Pacino in (And Justice for All). Wasn't a good move-ito pal-ito. 4_The weakness of the lead's main goal. I couldn't wholly buy how all what he wanted was the petty paycheck and living in a good room ! 5_I don't think that the hotel we watched needed desperately this publicity from the lead. There must have been more powerful reason for giving this deluxe room for him. So 5 bad vs. 10 good. Namely for every bad thing there are 2 good things to keep the sweetness up. Accordingly this is a good movie. Rather an average low budget comedy (to be sadistically objective !). Nothing wrong with light time, and this one provides that for harmless 88 minutes. Though the thing that I hated, wanting to put it in the "very bad things" section, is the way Pauly Shore and his movies were BANNED! I do not know at all how he wasn't forgiven for being himself in 5 movies he made, that's his all cinematic career to date by the way, while for instance Jim Carrey was for horrible disgusting trash he did one after another at his start, at the mid-90s too, such as (Dumb & Dumber), (Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls), (The Cable Guy) and (How the Grinch Stole Christmas) ??? Simply the major studios gave (Carrey) millions, while not giving Shore even a second chance. In the same time Adam Sandler acted as nothing but the same idiot fool for his first 10 movies and he got a career out of it. While Chris Tucker is known as unbearable, he had the opportunity to make Rush Hour 1,2, and 3 ?!! Steve Martin became not funny anymore, nevertheless they made him the new Pink Panther in not one but 2 movies ?!! In fact the list is long, yet with no (Shore) in it ?! If you think "unfair" already then you haven't heard Gene Siskel saying, in 1995, that (Shore) is annoying but not strategically annoying like Jim Carrey (HUH ??!!), or Roger Ebert saying that watching Jury Duty is like hearing long fingernails scratching a piece of glass for long time. Well, Roger, that's exactly what I feel while watching 2001 Space Odyssey, not Jury Duty ! The deduction : Not everyone loves Pauly Shore. However, he didn't have much time to develop, be different, or assure that he has good things, as the time some other actors apparently had to do the same. In any case still (Jury Duty) is : A Pauly Shore Classic. Cute unpretentious fun. "Bad" or "so Bad" are only what I call many of its reviews. Plus it's somehow a rare chance to watch a work of a comedian who his career by now has gone with the wind, and what a strange wind that was! By the way it's : "Judge-ito have a bite of my burrito, Ato have some of my tomato, Mr. Cockthrow have some of my...OK I won't say that one.".

    I'm not a hater of Pauly Shore by any means, he can be a very funny guy and I rather liked Biodome which came after this film. But this one really stretched Shore's smart aleck personality way too far. Jury Duty is now something I try to avoid figuring that back in the day I served on three of them at one time or another. And the next time I'm eligible I would be over 70 years old and would get an automatic exemption should I choose. But if you have nothing else to do, your life isn't going anywhere, why not take that magnificent sum of $5.00 a day for service. That's what Shore figures when his mother Shelley Winters and her long time boyfriend Charles Napier get married and he's at loose ends. And wouldn't you know it, he gets on the jury of an accused serial killer, Sean Whalen. Shore however finds a way to make Jury Duty not only profitable, but quite comfortable. Whalen is accused of butchering and dismembering several fast food managers when he's found sleeping at the place their bodies were stashed. If he didn't do it his hopes for justice rest on the shoulders of Pauly Shore a fate I'd not wish on anyone. Pauly gets way too over the top in Jury Duty and you'd better like him if you have any hopes of liking this film. Also I just can't believe that fellow juror Tia Carrere would ever fall for someone like Shore. But that's movie magic for you. Among other places Pauly takes his cues from is that flawed classic 12 Angry Men. When I reviewed that I said that Henry Fonda's actions, one in particular would have been grounds for a mistrial. Ironically because of what Shore does, Judge Abe Vigoda does declare a mistrial. Justice does get served in a highly unusual manner. If that pleases you by all means see Jury Duty. Otherwise people who are not Pauly Shore's fans will have a hard time with this film.

    Tommy still lives with his parents in a trailer park. He's trying to improve himself, but his parents aren't really pushing him. Though Tommy's father has a dream: collect styrofoam, no matter how dirty, from all the dumpsters and landfills he and Tommy can find, clean it, and recycle it. Oh, yeah, that's the way to live. One possible job for Tommy: a stripper at the club where his Uncle Sal works. Sal gives him a chance because he's family, but he just hasn't got the talent. Or the body. Then comes the terrible news: Tommy's parents are finally going to get married. In Las Vegas. But where will he live until they return? The couple who will take care of him are even worse than being homeless. But wait! That notice Tommy got in the mail about being called for jury duty. He can make a little money doing that, if it's a long trial. And he has to make sure to get a case where he gets sequestered. And, oh yeah, in nearly all situations like this ... do I really have to say what's going to happen? And the defendant is an accused serial killer who one can't possibly like, with an incompetent lawyer. One more detail: Although he ends up in a suite with the principal who expelled him from high school and still hates him--and keeps him up all night listening to motivational tapes--Tommy manages to con the hotel into giving him the best accommodations he can ask for! How have I never seen this? I love Pauly Shore movies. Actually, Shore didn't have quite the edge that I'm used to in this one. He had some great moments when he was trying to make sure he didn't get on the wrong kind of jury, and toward the end he really does a good job, considering he's Pauly Shore. I was concerned at one point, but the last 20 minutes or so make this movie really worth seeing. Sure, the writers have no concept of what would be legally permissible, and the number of offenses by jurors and other participants that could have resulted in a mistrial or contempt charges would fill a filing cabinet. But it's all entertaining. Eventually. Tia Carrere is really pretty and she has some good scenes. But it's hard to believe from his performance here that Abe Vigoda was ever part of such a respected show as "Barney Miller". You pretty much have to like Adam Sandler and Pauly Shore to like a movie of this type.

    I am sure that there is someone out there in movie audiences that like Pauly Shore. I mean, he has to have made something worth watching, right? Well, it certainly wasn't this movie. Except for Tia Carrere, there really isn't anything to see here. The concept is innovative, I have to admit. Made homeless, he gets on jury duty in a murder case to get sequestered, and he keeps the jury going (Spoof of 12 Angry Men?)to keep a roof over his head. But even the murderer (Sean Whalen) gets irritated. I got irritated long before that. Well, let's just wait for the next Pauly Shore venture with American Idol, Ruben Studdard. I am sure it will be as good as this one.

    i saw this movie on a DVD last night and the movie reminded me of a Bollywood film named "EK RUKA HUA FAISLA" which means A PENDING VERDICT. jury duty is a total rip off from this movie. but the Hindi flick was far better scripted and it was brilliantly acted by some of the most talented actors Indian film industry has. if you ppl don't believe wat has been written then check out this link.. http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157571/. the Hindi movie was released in 1986 whereas jury duty in 1995. so at last we have a Hollywood film ripping ideas from a bollywood(i prefer to call it the Hindi film industry). and it was done way back in the eighties!!!! so guys please for one time spare the poor bollywood film makers guilty of lifting off ideas from Hollywood .

    There is a scene early on in "Jury Duty" when Pauly Shore stands on a bus and imitates a town tour guide. It is obvious that this scene was written to showcase Pauly Shore's comedic talents, however, he makes noises and is loud and generally obnoxious and unfunny. "Jury Duty" is the point where Pauly Shore officially abused his stay in movies. After this movie, he would forever be sanctioned to the lunch table in the corner with the smelly kid, Carrot Top and the Noid from the Dominoes commercials. But not until he showed the world his versatility in Bio-Dome. Jury Duty is bad. Not bad like "In the Army Now," but close. There is little originality to the script, no amusing characters and about four funny lines. I did enjoy the scene where the witnesses from restaurants give testimonies in their respective fast food uniforms. There isn't much else here. It just isn't funny. Shore also lacks the wit his idiotic leading men contemporaries like Adam Sandler and Chris Farley showed in the 90s. These were all, more or less, bad versions of Steve Martin's wonderful "Jerk" character. All Shore shows in this movie is that he has the talent to bug you. Of course, not all the blame can be put on his shoulders. He has no script to work with. Nothing. I don't know why Stanley Tucci thought this movie would be good for him and or how the studio blackmailed him into being in it. I remembered both "Encino Man" and "Son in Law" were kind of funny in a stupid way. "Jury Duty " on the other hand is stupid in a very unfunny way.

    First of I want to point out that I like Pauley Shore and have enjoyed watching other comedy movies that he starred in and but I just didn't like Jury Duty and didn't find the humor to be that funny and it was kind of boring and a let down compared to Bio-Dome and other Pauley Shore movies! I had bought this movie on video before I watched it because since I had liked his other movies I assumed I would also like this but I didn't like it and I learned a lesson that I should watch a movie first before I buy it! This movie just didn't appeal to me at all! I would recommend people rent this before buying or try to watch it on TV first!
