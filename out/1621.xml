 <storyline>
  Eunice is walking along the highways of northern England from one filling station to another. She is searching for Judith, the woman, she says to be in love with. It's bad luck for the women at the cash desk not to be Judith, because Eunice is eccentric, angry and extreme dangerous. One day she meets Miriam, hard of hearing and a little ingenuous, who feels sympathy for Eunice and takes her home. Miriam is very impressed by Eunice's fierceness and willfulness and follows her on the search for Judith. Shocked by Eunice's cruelty she tries to make her a better person, but she looses ground herself.

    English screenwriter, producer and director Michael Winterbottom's feature film debut which was written by English author and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, premiered In competition at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival in 1995, was shot on locations in England and is a UK production which was produced by British producer Julie Baines. It tells the story about a jovial woman in her mid-20s named Miriam who lives with her grandmother and works at a petrol station. Miriam's life is rather quiet, but the day she meets a mysterious woman named Eunice who shows up out of nowhere looking for a woman named Judith and trying to remember a song, she experiences love at first sight. Distinctly and finely directed by UK filmmaker Michael Winterbottom, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated by Saskia Reeves and from the two main characters viewpoints, draws an unorthodox and instantly intriguing portrayal of a rare lesbian relationship between two contrary women. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Northern Irish cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, distinct dialog, chemistry between the actresses and excellent use of music and colors, this character-driven indie neo-noir from the mid-1990s about entwined personalities and the distinction between good and evil contains a great score by English composer John Harle. This darkly humorous, charming, atmospheric and somewhat enigmatic psychological thriller-drama which is set during a summer in Northern England and which becomes a voyage where a love-struck woman's altruistic intentions leads her into the aimless path of a schizophrenic serial killer who is completely out of touch with her spirituality, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent flash forward narrative structure, substantial character development, existentialistic undertones and the extraordinary acting performances by American-Canadian actress Amanda Plummer and English actress Saskia Reeves. A lyrical road-movie, heartrending love-story and commendable directorial debut.

    I found 'Butterfly Kiss' to be at once sad and horrifying, and a story of both love and hate. It drew from me feelings of empathy for the characters of Eunice (Eu)and Miriam (Mi), and revulsion for the acts of horror which mark their journey. Is this a love story where everyone else and everything else is disregarded for the sake of Eunice's relentless search for love, fulfillment, punishment, Judith? Or is this an observation of the torment of a schizophrenic woman? So much here to involve you and that will stay with you long after. The bleak northern England setting matches the mood of the movie perfectly, and the story shows Eu and Mi's journey and relationship but cleverly leaves much of it a mystery, but what really makes this special is the outstanding performance from Amanda Plummer as Eunice.

    I don't know if Eu is Bi-Polar because all I saw was raging mania; probably schizophrenic. She says what she wants, she does what she wants, and, when she takes off her shirt, you know she'll never be flying. So, she kills a guy and takes his van. This is a bit much for Mi, but she goes along anyway. Mi is the complete opposite of Eu. Naive and lonely and in real need, she hangs on for dear life. Amanda Plummer (The Fisher King, Miss Rose White) nailed this role in the performance of a lifetime. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Eunice (Eu). Saskia Reeves as Miriam (Mi) showed a sweetness that prevented her from objecting too loudly to Eu's deeds, until she transforms herself. Michael Winterbottom's (A Cock and Bull Story, The Road to Guantanamo) idea was developed into a great script by Frank Cottrell Boyce (A Cock & Bull Story). Winterbottom directed this film in a manner that your attention was always focused on what these two would do next. The van is switched for a car and the bodies are oiling up as they travel across the country. We never really know who "Judith" is, and it really doesn't matter as it is probably something deep in Eu's madness. Quite a different ending than Thelma and Louise.

    Look, for instance at darkfalz' comments. No , on second thoughts don't bother , the man is deranged, I just looked up his record of comments on other films and I see he is perfectly foaming at the mouth when it comes to depictions of women in anything but vapid model-girl roles. Oh yes, and he appears to think female victims of male violence are somehow to blame for it, merely by being there. I originally saw it as a tortured love story between one deeply damaged, psychotic woman and another who was drawn to her awful power , almost against her will. Perhaps an element of S & M present also. However I see Eu and Mi are interestingly suggested as different personalities of the same person by one reviewer. I'll have to see it again in the light of this comment. I didn't actually think the fact that both were women was particularly significant- not at all meant to be representative of lesbian love or anything like that. In fact the couple could have been a man and a woman or two men, the issue really was the attraction and need the two had for each other. Serious acting and screenplay. The accents didn't bother me, why should they, we hear thick US accents in movies all the time. I never quite understand why some Americans appear to need subtitles for Australian or UK accents

    This movie was great. I had to watch it twice, to make sure I got it all. It would be a great show to watch if you're in a phsycology class in college. I think the movie should be watched in education class. Amanda Plummer did a great performance. There are real people out there actually doing and thinking exactly what she did in the show. There are moments in the movie that seem as if this was a true story. If it is, I would like to know so I can read up on it. The title should be different. I can not think of one, but butterfly kiss just does not fit. My personal opinion is Amanda should get an award.

    Two lesbians, one totally insane with the whole spectrum of mental illness, and the other a borderline idiot, drive around England aimlessly, while helping decrease its population. But their journey isn't the only pointless and aimless thing - the film is, too. The movie has absolutely no point to make; it's just there. Plummer and Reeves are good, and the film is solidly directed, but the underlying basis of their characters isn't revealed, and this especially goes for the Plummer the killer. We are not given any background information about Plummer, not even when her spree-killing started. The fact that she is insane just isn't enough; a little background, or at least hints and clues to it, would have helped. The makers of the film clearly don't know what this is about (or haven't succeeded in making it clear at all). Plummer's character is highly unrealistic and totally unrepresentative of female mass murderers; when operating alone, female serial killers usually use poison, or a less violent method to kill (a gun, for example). It is highly unusual, to say the least, that they roam the roads smashing people's heads in. The fact that Plummer is extremely sloppy about when and where she kills - and the fact that she wants to be caught - would suggest that it's highly unrealistic that she wasn't caught earlier (this is Western Europe, after all, not the Ukraine). The film is definitely not for children, or people easily shocked; the "body metal" that Plummer wears is unlike anything I have come across in a film before. The soundtrack, occasionally even cheerful, is usually totally inappropriate; it often serves as an instrument to sentimentalize the lesbian relationship. However, no sane viewer is going to be the slightest bit touched about their "romance" - Plummer is killing innocent people, frchrissakes! Who cares about her "love-life"?! But considering that Michael Winterbottom directed it - it's superb. Just check out his other "masterpieces", like "9 Songs"...

    Amanda Plummer ravages through this film like a wounded hyena starving for what may be it's last meal come flood or high water. She may be Hollywoods best actress, but does she give a crap. I thinks not. Hollywood gives Oscars for cute models who show a talent for walking talking and chewing gum all at he same time. And if she can make herself ugly for a role, Hollywood seems astounded at her courage. Plummer can not only chew these little girls into so many wads of Jamaican licorice stick, but in this role as Eunice, she makes Robert DeNiro look like a neutered cub scout. This is as powerful a performance as you'll see. And on top of that her English accent is superb. There aren't any other actresses in Hollywood that could play this role. Maybe Renee Zellweger could come close. But I doubt she'd have the guts to do it. This is a very disturbing film. But a performance like this would make even the great Kim Stanley cringe.

    Seeing that so many people have gone out of their way to denigrate Butterfly Kiss, I feel constrained to weigh in on its virtues. It is not a Hollywood entertainment, nor is it a Jane Austen prestige picture, or a politely naughty comedy for the art house crowd. It's a movie for people who are willing to risk a certain amount of emotional discomfort to gain the benefits of experiencing the world through unaccustomed perspectives. It's for those who want to learn about human beings on the margins of society, the forgotten, the pathological, the lost. It's the sort of film that can't be appreciated without a high tolerance for unsympathetic protagonists, unreliable narrators, unintelligible motivations, and morally ambiguous conclusions. In short, Butterfly Kiss demands an intellectual curiosity and nimbleness of mind that's not always characteristic of American audiences. This is not to argue that it's necessarily a good film, or successful at achieving its ambitions. More than once, while watching it, I found myself wondering how much relation to real people this story might actually have. Unlike Monster, with which it has obvious parallels, Butterfly Kiss doesn't appear to be based on factual events. The film's ability to cause me to "suspend disbelief" suffered from a touch too much Grand Guignol excess and, perhaps more damningly, writerly artifice. (For no clear reason, the protagonists are named "You"(Eunice) & "Me" (Miriam).) But the characters kept on surprising me, which indicates, if nothing else, that there's something vital and alive about this story. By the end, I was moved to pity for these two deeply damaged women, and, perhaps more importantly, I was moved to compassion. For that, I'd sit through an unpleasant movie any day of the week.

    If this film had been about two gay lovers going around murdering women, the feminists would have come out of the woodwork to condemn it. Of course since it's a female murdering males left and right, it's OK with everyone. The NOW harpies denounced "American Psycho" calling it a how-to for killing women. And it had only a fraction of the body count, female-wise. Funny how they overlooked this one. Oh that's right, it's "good" to see men killed by a woman. In any event, it's a total tasteless waste of anyone's time. Perhaps a few man haters (of either gender) will get a charge out of it. Even if you liked "Natural Born Killers" (another slaughter fest of males) you will not likely enjoy this endless, plodding and senseless movie. I can't imagine anyone involved with this disaster would ever use it on his/her resume.

    I saw this film years ago, when it just was released in the cinemas here in the UK. I was young then and it was almost a painful experience to watch it through to conclusion. I remember it being described once as a horror film. I wouldn't have agreed with that as a genre, but I could see why. I feel that the much later BAISE MOI owes much to the ground that this first tread. I enjoyed it, but through parted fingers at the time. The many scenes that seemed to dwell lovingly on flesh pulled tight till bleeding seemed gruesome in extremis. I think I got it the first time. After that, HELLRAISER was hardly as dread as it hoped to be. With so many films being much the same as the other, I think we need more films like this - if only to give us more choice.

    I saw this film years ago, when it just was released in the cinemas here in the UK. I was young then and it was almost a painful experience to watch it through to conclusion. I remember it being described once as a horror film. I wouldn't have agreed with that as a genre, but I could see why. I feel that the much later BAISE MOI owes much to the ground that this first tread. I enjoyed it, but through parted fingers at the time. The many scenes that seemed to dwell lovingly on flesh pulled tight till bleeding seemed gruesome in extremis. I think I got it the first time. After that, HELLRAISER was hardly as dread as it hoped to be. With so many films being much the same as the other, I think we need more films like this - if only to give us more choice.

    English screenwriter, producer and director Michael Winterbottom's feature film debut which was written by English author and screenwriter Frank Cottrell Boyce, premiered In competition at the 45th Berlin International Film Festival in 1995, was shot on locations in England and is a UK production which was produced by British producer Julie Baines. It tells the story about a jovial woman in her mid-20s named Miriam who lives with her grandmother and works at a petrol station. Miriam's life is rather quiet, but the day she meets a mysterious woman named Eunice who shows up out of nowhere looking for a woman named Judith and trying to remember a song, she experiences love at first sight. Distinctly and finely directed by UK filmmaker Michael Winterbottom, this finely tuned fictional tale which is narrated by Saskia Reeves and from the two main characters viewpoints, draws an unorthodox and instantly intriguing portrayal of a rare lesbian relationship between two contrary women. While notable for it's naturalistic milieu depictions, sterling cinematography by Northern Irish cinematographer Seamus McGarvey, distinct dialog, chemistry between the actresses and excellent use of music and colors, this character-driven indie neo-noir from the mid-1990s about entwined personalities and the distinction between good and evil contains a great score by English composer John Harle. This darkly humorous, charming, atmospheric and somewhat enigmatic psychological thriller-drama which is set during a summer in Northern England and which becomes a voyage where a love-struck woman's altruistic intentions leads her into the aimless path of a schizophrenic serial killer who is completely out of touch with her spirituality, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent flash forward narrative structure, substantial character development, existentialistic undertones and the extraordinary acting performances by American-Canadian actress Amanda Plummer and English actress Saskia Reeves. A lyrical road-movie, heartrending love-story and commendable directorial debut.

    I found 'Butterfly Kiss' to be at once sad and horrifying, and a story of both love and hate. It drew from me feelings of empathy for the characters of Eunice (Eu)and Miriam (Mi), and revulsion for the acts of horror which mark their journey. Is this a love story where everyone else and everything else is disregarded for the sake of Eunice's relentless search for love, fulfillment, punishment, Judith? Or is this an observation of the torment of a schizophrenic woman? So much here to involve you and that will stay with you long after. The bleak northern England setting matches the mood of the movie perfectly, and the story shows Eu and Mi's journey and relationship but cleverly leaves much of it a mystery, but what really makes this special is the outstanding performance from Amanda Plummer as Eunice.

    I don't know if Eu is Bi-Polar because all I saw was raging mania; probably schizophrenic. She says what she wants, she does what she wants, and, when she takes off her shirt, you know she'll never be flying. So, she kills a guy and takes his van. This is a bit much for Mi, but she goes along anyway. Mi is the complete opposite of Eu. Naive and lonely and in real need, she hangs on for dear life. Amanda Plummer (The Fisher King, Miss Rose White) nailed this role in the performance of a lifetime. I cannot imagine anyone else playing Eunice (Eu). Saskia Reeves as Miriam (Mi) showed a sweetness that prevented her from objecting too loudly to Eu's deeds, until she transforms herself. Michael Winterbottom's (A Cock and Bull Story, The Road to Guantanamo) idea was developed into a great script by Frank Cottrell Boyce (A Cock & Bull Story). Winterbottom directed this film in a manner that your attention was always focused on what these two would do next. The van is switched for a car and the bodies are oiling up as they travel across the country. We never really know who "Judith" is, and it really doesn't matter as it is probably something deep in Eu's madness. Quite a different ending than Thelma and Louise.

    Look, for instance at darkfalz' comments. No , on second thoughts don't bother , the man is deranged, I just looked up his record of comments on other films and I see he is perfectly foaming at the mouth when it comes to depictions of women in anything but vapid model-girl roles. Oh yes, and he appears to think female victims of male violence are somehow to blame for it, merely by being there. I originally saw it as a tortured love story between one deeply damaged, psychotic woman and another who was drawn to her awful power , almost against her will. Perhaps an element of S & M present also. However I see Eu and Mi are interestingly suggested as different personalities of the same person by one reviewer. I'll have to see it again in the light of this comment. I didn't actually think the fact that both were women was particularly significant- not at all meant to be representative of lesbian love or anything like that. In fact the couple could have been a man and a woman or two men, the issue really was the attraction and need the two had for each other. Serious acting and screenplay. The accents didn't bother me, why should they, we hear thick US accents in movies all the time. I never quite understand why some Americans appear to need subtitles for Australian or UK accents

    This movie was great. I had to watch it twice, to make sure I got it all. It would be a great show to watch if you're in a phsycology class in college. I think the movie should be watched in education class. Amanda Plummer did a great performance. There are real people out there actually doing and thinking exactly what she did in the show. There are moments in the movie that seem as if this was a true story. If it is, I would like to know so I can read up on it. The title should be different. I can not think of one, but butterfly kiss just does not fit. My personal opinion is Amanda should get an award.

    Two lesbians, one totally insane with the whole spectrum of mental illness, and the other a borderline idiot, drive around England aimlessly, while helping decrease its population. But their journey isn't the only pointless and aimless thing - the film is, too. The movie has absolutely no point to make; it's just there. Plummer and Reeves are good, and the film is solidly directed, but the underlying basis of their characters isn't revealed, and this especially goes for the Plummer the killer. We are not given any background information about Plummer, not even when her spree-killing started. The fact that she is insane just isn't enough; a little background, or at least hints and clues to it, would have helped. The makers of the film clearly don't know what this is about (or haven't succeeded in making it clear at all). Plummer's character is highly unrealistic and totally unrepresentative of female mass murderers; when operating alone, female serial killers usually use poison, or a less violent method to kill (a gun, for example). It is highly unusual, to say the least, that they roam the roads smashing people's heads in. The fact that Plummer is extremely sloppy about when and where she kills - and the fact that she wants to be caught - would suggest that it's highly unrealistic that she wasn't caught earlier (this is Western Europe, after all, not the Ukraine). The film is definitely not for children, or people easily shocked; the "body metal" that Plummer wears is unlike anything I have come across in a film before. The soundtrack, occasionally even cheerful, is usually totally inappropriate; it often serves as an instrument to sentimentalize the lesbian relationship. However, no sane viewer is going to be the slightest bit touched about their "romance" - Plummer is killing innocent people, frchrissakes! Who cares about her "love-life"?! But considering that Michael Winterbottom directed it - it's superb. Just check out his other "masterpieces", like "9 Songs"...

    Amanda Plummer ravages through this film like a wounded hyena starving for what may be it's last meal come flood or high water. She may be Hollywoods best actress, but does she give a crap. I thinks not. Hollywood gives Oscars for cute models who show a talent for walking talking and chewing gum all at he same time. And if she can make herself ugly for a role, Hollywood seems astounded at her courage. Plummer can not only chew these little girls into so many wads of Jamaican licorice stick, but in this role as Eunice, she makes Robert DeNiro look like a neutered cub scout. This is as powerful a performance as you'll see. And on top of that her English accent is superb. There aren't any other actresses in Hollywood that could play this role. Maybe Renee Zellweger could come close. But I doubt she'd have the guts to do it. This is a very disturbing film. But a performance like this would make even the great Kim Stanley cringe.

    Seeing that so many people have gone out of their way to denigrate Butterfly Kiss, I feel constrained to weigh in on its virtues. It is not a Hollywood entertainment, nor is it a Jane Austen prestige picture, or a politely naughty comedy for the art house crowd. It's a movie for people who are willing to risk a certain amount of emotional discomfort to gain the benefits of experiencing the world through unaccustomed perspectives. It's for those who want to learn about human beings on the margins of society, the forgotten, the pathological, the lost. It's the sort of film that can't be appreciated without a high tolerance for unsympathetic protagonists, unreliable narrators, unintelligible motivations, and morally ambiguous conclusions. In short, Butterfly Kiss demands an intellectual curiosity and nimbleness of mind that's not always characteristic of American audiences. This is not to argue that it's necessarily a good film, or successful at achieving its ambitions. More than once, while watching it, I found myself wondering how much relation to real people this story might actually have. Unlike Monster, with which it has obvious parallels, Butterfly Kiss doesn't appear to be based on factual events. The film's ability to cause me to "suspend disbelief" suffered from a touch too much Grand Guignol excess and, perhaps more damningly, writerly artifice. (For no clear reason, the protagonists are named "You"(Eunice) & "Me" (Miriam).) But the characters kept on surprising me, which indicates, if nothing else, that there's something vital and alive about this story. By the end, I was moved to pity for these two deeply damaged women, and, perhaps more importantly, I was moved to compassion. For that, I'd sit through an unpleasant movie any day of the week.

    If this film had been about two gay lovers going around murdering women, the feminists would have come out of the woodwork to condemn it. Of course since it's a female murdering males left and right, it's OK with everyone. The NOW harpies denounced "American Psycho" calling it a how-to for killing women. And it had only a fraction of the body count, female-wise. Funny how they overlooked this one. Oh that's right, it's "good" to see men killed by a woman. In any event, it's a total tasteless waste of anyone's time. Perhaps a few man haters (of either gender) will get a charge out of it. Even if you liked "Natural Born Killers" (another slaughter fest of males) you will not likely enjoy this endless, plodding and senseless movie. I can't imagine anyone involved with this disaster would ever use it on his/her resume.
