    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive.

Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design. The bedrooms in particular are exaggerated to reinforce the fantasy of the world presented. Each with a motif entirely impractical in reality. The L.A. of Nowhere is a disturbed worldview. He uses subversive signs, such as seen in his other films, in the background to clarify the fantasy. A convenience store has no name Â– merely the word CONSUME and posters with BUY and MORE on the windows. Next to a nervous young characters a sign on a bench says GOD HELP ME. Much of the modest production value is achieved through creative design and colourful lighting used in otherwise bland sets. It's clear Araki had very little to work with and invested money where it was needed most. There are no elaborate visual tricks such as in the similarly themed Spun (2002) (which features Mena Suvari Â– making her debut here), Natural Born Killers or Domino (2005). As twisted as the far less polished Tromeo and Juliet (1996), Nowhere is a fantastic subversion of the teen movie. With less emphasis on homosexuality than Araki's earlier films, except for gratuitous posterior shots and a sensitive romance unfolding though the course of the film, Nowhere is certainly more accessible to mainstream viewers. Something of a prototype for his bi-sexual romantic comedy Splendor (1999). Like Larry Clark's borderline mainstream endeavour Teenage Caveman (2002), Araki's film world is a comical yet disturbing extreme. One in which escapist indulgences both sexual and narcotic lead to no life lessons. Love does not triumph and there is no hope for the future. They go nowhere and the nightmare never ends.

    How ironic. I've never given out a legitimate indication of a perfect score before now. Before today. So it definitely goes without saying that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was emotionally powerful, empty, and so...stale... It's literally nothing, but a nightmare -- an infinite melancholy of terror and confused poetry. It's contagiously devoid of the spires of purpose and self-fulfillment...dead before you can squint... It's a terrifically suicidal film that will keep you suspended in the midst of curiosity and perplexity. An absolute masterpiece. Nowhere literally goes "nowhere". You're not a true critic, if you can't recognize its genius.

    I'm 70 years old and think this film is an unrecognized masterpiece. For full disclosure, I am Gay so that may account for part of my admiration. In any event, it's a tantalizing, very sensual film. Not for all tastes of course and it would frighten some immature minds and presents some possibly-dangerous ideas in the wrong "hands." But so did Gone with The Wind for that matter. I had to watch it twice to try and understand some aspects that most will not "get." Perhaps having dropped acid back in the day did help my "getting" at least some of the film's possible meanings." One might be tempted to draw some comparisons to Penelope Spheeris' The Decline of Western Civilization which is "an American documentary film filmed through 1979 and 1980Â…" about the Los Angeles punk rock scene.

    Think of it as "Earth Girls are Easy" meets "Eraserhead." Don't believe the people who have written that this film is about "typical adolescent experiences." It represents a certain SEGMENT of kids, but they are by no means typical of ALL kids. And frankly, it's dated already. Anyhow, there's something hypnotic about watching shallow, self-absorbed, assholic kind of people taking drugs, having sex and having interesting hallucinations, but don't expect a point or a plot. Except maybe that the point is there IS no point, which is boring, because it's been done so many times. And I would love to know why the hell Dark is the only one who sees the Alien. Or why he sees the Alien at all. Or maybe that's too much to ask for in this gleefully debauched little flick. Maybe worth watching just for the whole stupidity of it all, but for God's sake, don't rent. Not worth the $4.50

    Nowhere is the appropriate title for this eccentric, cynical film from Gregg Araki. It takes you through a series of numerous, strange tales of bland yet comical characters and how they all intertwine in the end. It's pointless, but in the end great fun for how ridiculous it is, and a lot of people enjoy those types of films. With juicy dialog of how people can get blood poisoning and die from popping zits, brief mentions of testicle and ingrown butt hairs, how dogs eating people is cool and the captivating scenes of people being killed with tomato sauce cans, homosexuals bursting into alien bugs after being abducted, people wanting to die while they're getting a blowjob and people committing suicide to an aired preach about how Jesus can save you this movie is one big joke and an excellent one at that from beginning to end. It can be quite sexily perverse at times, too, and the atmosphere through out the whole film is on the "trippy" side. It's filthy, entertaining, weird, witty humor and material just confuses the audience to the point where you're staring at the television, mind blank, mouth wide open and wondering, "Why am I still watching this?" You're still watching it because of how absurd, senseless and comically amusing it really is folks, that's the deal, don't try to make it anything more or anything less. There are tons, tons of enjoyable, fun cameos and supporting performances by Christina Applegate, Scott Caan, Beverly D'Angelo, Shannen Doherty, Heather Graham, Christopher Knight, Jordan Ladd, Debi Mazar, Rose McGowan, Ryan Phillipe, Denise Richards, John Ritter, Kathleen Robertson and Mena Suvari as well as incredible (for this type of movie) main performances by James Duval, Rachel True and Nathan Bexton. Though Mysterious Skin is definitely the better Araki film by a long shot, I suggest anyone who can take this for exactly what it is see it; it's fun. Just don't be expecting a masterpiece, or vice versa, be completely open minded, for trust me, all I just stated in this review is only the beginning of Nowhere. It's complicatedly simple, end of story.

    I really liked this film, pretty much because of how "out there" it is. Gregg Araki created a trippy tale of teen angst that is so over-dramatized that it actually makes you feel drunk while you're watching it. The aliens were a nice addition, but certainly a very random one. I probably haven't seen this much drug content involving teens since I saw the film "Kids". Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.

    After the superior, The Living End and Totally f**ked up, Araki's two next films spiraled, this one a more desperate attempt on the last, until he redeemed himself with Mysterious Skin, probably his best ever. Take strong reference to the title. This is a going nowhere movie, though, like The Doom Generation, you can't deny it's color, and enthusiasm, in it's over the top characters and situations, where even a couple who were once the Brady kids appear. One shock moment I recall, was the hot shot actor, raping a female fan. This movie has no direction, it's messages unexplanatory, only there are a lot of f**ked kids in L.A. burdened with their usual baggage and angst. This is just another movie of put together out there scenes, a few familiar faces in this too. This is the prime reason, this falls even weaker than The Doom Generation. One good thing out of it was hottie, Menu Suvari in what is another Araki mess. You could almost make a film like this, by going out on the town with your friends, or at their parties, where the rest you could script with some out there stuff to give it some flavor.

    James Duval once again plays the role of a sexually confused teenager named Dark. He has a very outspoken mother who requests of him but one thing: to stop the self-abuse. Indeed, in the opening scene we find Dark in the shower ardently stroking his penis as he reimagines some of his sexual encounters with Mel, his bisexual girlfriend, and particularly a moment he shares in the locker room with Montgomery (played by Nathan Bexton). Just like in Araki's Totally F***ed Up (part of the Apocalypse Teenage Trilogy), the story revolves around a cast of troubled teenagers. This is a generation of youngsters that take the imperative of joy to the extreme, they live their lives as if the world is about to end, and everything they do is of the utmost intensity. There is sheer perversity in Shad (played by Ryan Phillippe) and Lilith (Heather Graham), both devotees of bondage and sadomasochism. When Shad is all tied up and about to be dominated by Lilith, he adopts a particular position in the sexual structure: here the subject makes himself the instrument of the Other's jouissance. The pervert is the person in whom the structure of the drive is most clearly revealed, and also the person who carries the attempt to go beyond the pleasure principle to the limit "he who goes as far as he can along the path of jouissance". Sadism motivates the Teen Idol's actions as he seduces a girl who is totally infatuated by his specular image (namely, the notoriety and fame derived of his TV appearances). As a sadist he locates himself as the object of the invocatory drive, not only brutally hitting the girl but also raping her. The imperative of joy also takes its toll on the homosexual couple formed by Cowboy and Bart; Bart is a drug addict beyond recovery, despite all the efforts his boyfriend does to help him. Perhaps the only normal couple, albeit "in the making", would be formed by Dingbat (played by Christina Applegate) and Ducky (Scott Caan). But everything is sort of in the making, as these college kids can't seem to make up their minds. For example, Dark confronts Mel as he is uneasy with her promiscuity (and bisexuality). "Sometimes I feel so old fashioned", he confesses. It would be fair to state that theirs is a case of sexual failure because the object of desire, insofar as it is incarnated, never accedes in turn to the Other sex. And this is a translation of Lacan's proposition "there is no such thing as sexual rapport". Dark expresses a restrained concept of what is properly sexual. Thus it concerns the rapport to the Other sex, to the Other body as sexed, and specially as sexed differently - body to body, sexed body to sexed body. In so constricting the range of sexuality, in focusing on corporeity he demonstrates that sexuality is utterly undone or not constituted. At the time of sexual jouissance, the rapport one counts upon, the rapport that should be there takes the form of failure. That is why Dark grows more and more comfortable with Montgomery's presence; Dark's object of desire is shifting towards a sexed body that mirrors his own: a male body. Lacan's expression of "corporeal excerpt" serves to qualify what he calls the object a. It entails a debasement of the Other, having it demeaned from the status of Other as such to the rank of the object a of drive. And this is the path Lacan follows when he announces that there is no such thing as sexual rapport. Every couple in the film is a living manifest of this sexual failure, unable to connect to the other, they live desperately and on the verge of destruction. It isn't surprising, then, to witness the suicides of two characters partly prompted by religious zealousness. Suicide here is also a successful attempt of the real to break into reality which coincides with the constant irruption of the alien, not only as a headline that proclaims that space aliens are kidnapping children but as a very 'real' manifestation of an alien monster that only Dark and Montgomery are able to see. The alien serves as a metaphor of the uncanny double, originated as the mortifying aspect of narcissism when it is not limited by castration. Narcissism presupposes to mask death itself. Nevertheless, here the alien is responsible for the death of a few college girls, and once Montgomery disappears Dark fears the worse. When something of this object a (id est Montgomery) of the phantasm appears in the real, on top of the frame, disrupting it and therefore disrupting the 'scene' that so far has contained it, the effect that ensues is marked by angst. Such is the case of the alien monster who appears always between moments, between sequences, almost taunting Dark, on the fringes of reality and the real. Araki's masterful representation of the manner in which the phantasm is framed reveals the importance of what many viewers might consider random and capricious appearances. When Montgomery shows up in Dark's room, stark naked, they start talking. Montgomery affirms "I got kidnapped by space aliens". It's not long before they decide to share the bed (yet another hint pointing out the sexual failure). Dark and Montgomery move through a difficult zone, they can't "pull it out", they're doomed to let go of the conceptual inveigling that Lacan has accomplished, and that always articulates jouissance with castration, that is a phallic function. When Montgomery experiences an abnormal seizure Dark asks him "Tell me what it is", which is an impossible question because, after all, the real exceeds language. Whatever is wrong with Montgomery, no language could express it. The after credits final scene is the perfect closure for Araki's narrative, as it reinserts again not only the failure of sex but also the complete failure of language.

    A real aesthetic triumph, what Nowhere lacks in narrative it more than makes up for in imagination. Certainly an acquired taste, Gregg Araki's film is bitter eye candy. One could describe it as Kids (1996) meets Natural Born Killers (1994), Dazed and Confused (1993) on acid, Beverly Hills 90210 meets Requiem for a Dream (2000). Each shorthand description is apt. Running barely 75 minutes (without the credit sequences) this modestly budgeted film is pure trash art. With a loose plot thread taking our teenage protagonists through a single day, culminating in an obligatory party, Nowhere is essentially a series of deranged vignettes. Each offsetting its sickly sweet colour schemes and "whatever" dialogue with a bleak undercurrent. Punctuating the tragicomic melodrama with moments of extreme violence. Araki struck gold when he assembled his cast.Headed by indie favourite James Duval as a pretentious and melancholy Keanu Reeve's-type, each beautiful young performer gets a chance to shine in this deranged neon nightmare. Here are just a handful of examples. Christina Applegate is brilliantly cast against her "MarriedÂ… With Children" sex bomb stereotype. One-time "Baywatch" teen idol Jaason Simmons bravely presents himself as a less than desirable dream date. And teen icons Shannon Doherty (loathed TV icon) and Traci Lords (one-time underage porn idol) are zapped by an alien after some inane chatter. What is interesting is how time has changed perception of the film. Whereas once we watched unknowns and marvelled at the subversive presentation of pop culture icons, such as John Ritter as an evangelist, now we see a film cast with movie stars. Post-Nowhere ascension to stardom from some of the ensemble and subsequent turns in more typical teen movie fare reinforcing the film's off-kilter themes. The final part of a trilogy, following Totally F***ed Up (1993) and The Doom Generation (1995), Nowhere benefits from a decent budget which allowed for not only a high calibre cast and a decent glossy look but also for impressively rendered set design.

Trust me, "Nowhere" is a movie worth watching. Expect to be feel weird after you have viewed "Nowhere", because you most likely will feel very strange-- talk about Beverly Hills 90210 on acid. The whole atmosphere of the film is reminiscent of such dystopian society displayed in movies such as "A Clockwork Orange", but I'm sure it probably wasn't intended to be that way. "Nowhere" has it all, including its share of sexual tensions between all of the characters, as well as random outbursts of insanity (at one point involving a character being brutally killed with a can of Campbell's tomato soup). "Nowhere" just might frighten you at the most unexpected time, and even if you aren't frightened or disturbed, you'll still be thinking "WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?". Beneath all of its extreme oddities, the movie is pretty much a coming-of-age film that depicts the liberal youth's urge to party like an animal on a Friday night. This, of course, is no regular Friday night, for the "party of the year" is supposed to take place. Some party it was, for it was near-literally the end of the world for some characters. You've got to love the touches of strange science fiction to "Nowhere", and of course I am referring to the trippy (and corny in a cool way) alien abductions. Also, here's a word for you that relates to the movie: bisexuality. Yes, bisexual tensions, and just enough of them for you not to say "I can't take this anymore". Despite relationship dramas throughout the movie,"Nowhere" stays away from too many romance factors to stay true to its rather avant-garde-esquire nature, which I found very pleasing. As far-fetched and messed-up the movie sounds, "Nowhere" is an entertaining movie experience. Before you watch any other Gregg Araki movies (such as the amazing "Mysterious Skin"), watch "Nowhere" because it relates to his other films and really gives you a good idea of his film-making style. Watch "Nowhere", chances are you'll think it was worth the time.

    Hunky eighteen-year-old James Duval (as Dark Smith) has homoerotic fantasies about pretty blond boy Nathan Bexton (as Montgomery), but wants to be true to bisexual girlfriend Rachel True (as Mel). She is also seeing purple-haired Kathleen Robertson (as Lucifer), and tells Mr. Duval they should have sex with as many people as possible, before getting so old and ugly nobody will want them. Gregg Araki's "Nowhere" is mainly Duval's story, but other friends and acquaintances have sexual subplots. Witty airhead pal Christina Applegate (as Dingbat) likes stoner Scott Caan (as Ducky), who appears and disappears. His sweet sister Sarah Lassez (as Egg aka Polly) meets teen idol Jaason Simmons (of "Baywatch"), who shocks her with rough sex. Rocker Guillermo Diaz (as Cowboy) has trouble with masochistic boyfriend Jeremy Jordan (as Bart), who is unable to moderate his drug use. Get in line. As Mr. Jordan's parents, Christopher Knight and Eve Plumb get the best of several "cameo" appearances. Shady dealer Alan Boyce (as Handjob) cuts bad dope for biker Thyme Lewis (as Elvis), who is driving it home with cute Jordan Ladd (as Alyssa). Her brother Ryan Phillippe (as Shad) licks off Heather Graham (as Lilith), and visa versa. Relatively young Joshua Gibran Mayweather (as Zero) and girlish Mena Suvari (as Zoe) want in on the action, which cumulates as most of the gang gather for a big party. An alien abduction threatens protagonist Duval's chances for happiness. To the point, the ending bites. ****** Nowhere (5/9/97) Gregg Araki ~ James Duval, Nathan Bexton, Rachel True, Jeremy Jordan

    Being a devoted Direct TV customer brings a strange and questionable benefit.Each year there is a 2-month free access to Showtime, including IFO, an acronym for It's !&%#!! Obscene--not in the sense of pornographic, rather an obscene waste of time and resources. I'll admit to being over 70, therefore way beyond the age of understanding the nihilism of today--or was it yesterday? Whatever. The sheer idiocy and self-involvement of the characters, the sloppy editing, pretending to be edgy, the predictable twists and turns, make this the perfect movie to watch during the endless commercial breaks in football broadcasts. The "romantic" encounters can only be described as reptilian; it's like watching the courtship of iguanas. As an artist/photographer, with a few surviving friends, I have always enjoyed meaningful cinematic innovation. This film ain't it! It brings to mind a TAXI episode, a flashback to Ignatowski's days at Harvard in the 60's. A young Tom Hanks does a great turn as a stoned classmate. He's lying on the floor of Iggy's room, entranced by a lava lamp. In disgust, a pre-drug Iggy pulls the plug. Hanks looks up in dismay and anger, asking "Oh, and now what"? My feelings exactly, about "Nowhere.
