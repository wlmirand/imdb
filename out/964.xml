 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  For 16 years Miss Bentley has been spending April at an elegant hillside villa on Lake Como. This year, 1937, her London society artist father has recently died and the only other English-speaking guests are brash Americans. Then Major Wilshaw arrives. He suggests they meet for cocktails and Miss Bentley stands him up -- not even thinking about it -- as she helps the new nanny of an Italian family settle in. Miss Beaumont, a tall, young American who has dropped out of finishing school in Switzerland, is bored and finds some amusement in flirting with the major, whose libido is awakened for the first time since before the great war. And Miss Bentley now finds more about the major to admire than his ears.

    For 16 years Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave) has been spending April at an elegant hillside villa on Lake Como. It's 1937, and her father has recently died. It was going to be an uneventful vacation and then Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox) arrives. Add to the mix is Miss Beaumont (Uma Thurman), a tall, flirtatious, sassy, young American. It's all fun and games to her, but her affects are much more powerful than she realizes. It's a breezy film at first like the countryside setting. It is where the rich set vacation. There's some attempts at slapstick with the tennis game. The Italians are mostly cartoonish. Vanessa is easy going. Uma is flashy. When the specter of jealousy arise, the story finally gets going. Instead of using this emotional drama, the story ends and it's wrapped up with a happy ending. It lacks any tension or power. Vanessa Redgrave makes it watchable. It's just a slow watch.

    It seems like a good baby=boomer escapist package: Redgrave, Fox, Thurman, but take a director who's unsuited to romantic meringues, a cast with no chemistry, and a script in which so little happens that a month by the lake seems stretch into a decade; and you're in trouble. Edward Fox seems sensible casting as the correct British major, but he's awkward, unconvincing, and made to play most scenes too large or too thin. Ms Redgrave, despite the 1937 setting is wearing clothes she bought in Hampstead last week, and carries on like an over-excited schoolgirl. Perhaps all the fun was contained within the set. She's unconvincing, as is her relationship with Mr Fox, which, unfortunately is the glue of the story. Her rival for his affections is Uma Thurman, who distinguishes herself by giving a misguided reading of every line she has to utter. She can't even wave goodbye convincingly. Every moment she's on screen is excruciatingly wrong. The director takes a cack-handed approach to the tone of almost every scene; the structure is awkward, and even the close-ups of the two leads are unflattering and clumsy - especially those of Mr Fox. Alida Valli, manages to be Irvin-proof; Nicola Piovani provides some sweet, schmaltzy music and Pasqualino de Santis's photography is very pretty.

    In 1937 Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave 58) summers at lake Como at a hotel she has spent the summer at for 16 years. There she meets Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox 58) and the other main character in this triangle Miss Beaumont (Urma Thurman 28). Bentley is a delightful cheerful character single and is interested in the fusty Major Wilshaw. He in turn has eyes for the 28 year old Miss Beaumont who strings him along in a sadistic way. I guess the only thing that occurred to me is why Miss Bentley would be interested in Major Wilshaw a rather unattractive short man (Redgrave is still rather attractive at 58)...if they had cast someone a bit more handsome than Fox... but then it helps delineate the themes of the story better and makes Miss Beaumont's sadistic flirting much more believable. The first time I saw the movie in 1995 I didn't like Redgrave's Bentley character but this time I did the movie was much better the second time. Something about her hyper flighty too good to be true nature seemed contrived the first time but not really the second? I have aged 15 years and am 59 myself now maybe that is part of it. The movie has a little of the requisite anti fascist political pounding going on from time to time but it is restrained thank God--it would have ruined a well done little story. Good movie watch it.

    I do not understand the people that say this is a good movie. I guess the potential is there... but it flopped big time. The only good thing about this movie is Redgrave. Oh yeah... and the hot young Italian she shuns... Storyline: older lady likes older man. Older man likes younger woman. Younger woman leads on older man. Audience falls asleep. Why anyone likes the older man is beyond comprehension. He is unattractive in so many ways. He has one of the most unlikeable personalities ever. And I don't mean that you will come to understand his quirky ways later in the movie... you don't. He is just as unlikeable in the end as he is in the beginning. Ms. Redgraves character is so enamored with him for NO reason at all. I don't understand it. He is not witty, polite, smart, anything... ick. Uma's character is pointless, mean and well... pointless and mean. Maybe the book was better than the movie. The movie stunk.

    Honestly, what a disappointment. Every. Single. Sentence. Spoken. Like. This. S-l-o-w-l-y. It made me just about jump out of my skin (and I can watch a four-hour silent movie without losing interest for a minute). I haven't written a review here in ages, but this movie needs a warning label. I've seen all three of the stars give fabulous performances so it must have been the director. Here, Redgrave's performance is so weird I couldn't figure out what she thought she was doing. Fox and Thurman could not have known what they were entrusting to the film stock-- performances in an acting style from the distant past...only slower. And the story is so clich&eacute;d - out-of-date clich&eacute;s, not even current ones! - that it was painful to watch. There *can't* be any spoilers, the only element of surprise being that you can't believe the filmmakers would actually dare do anything so obvious. Watch "Enchanted April" for what this might have been.

    Warning: Spoilers of sorts. Beautiful, lush sets and scenery. Characterizations of oddball characters bounce all over the map. Uneven direction from a director whose right hand doesn't seem to know what his left hand is doing. Or care. Script is nothing to shout about either. Strangely non-affecting. Not especially amusing, not especially romantic, not even a little bit sexy. It's a bit of a mystery why the two main characters are attracted to one another or why they end up together. Odd, off-hand treatment of impending war. A collection of truly bizarre performances. Normally reliable actors run amok. No doubt the director's and screenwriter's faults. A film that tries hard, very hard, too hard and doesn't succeed. Can't really recommend, but on the other hand, it's not a complete waste of time. It apparently has its audience.

    It is 1937, and a spunky spinster (Vanessa Redgrave) is spending a month at a villa on Lake Como. There she meets and is intrigued by a pompous old major (Edward Fox). He, on the other hand, has eyes only for a lovely but cruel young nanny (Uma Thurmon). How could a movie about beautiful Lake Como and a lovelorn English lady go wrong? Apparently, very easily. This terribly-misguided movie has a juvenile script, hammy actors, and poor direction. Even the wardrobe, makeup, and hairdos are way off, looking like contemporary styles rather than pre-WWII. The attraction between the spinster and the major is never explained and their bantering is off-putting as well as boring. Thurmon over-enunciates every syllable and shouts like she's doing a (bad) high school play. None of the stars is believable in their roles. Despite the picturesque location, there's absolutely nothing romantic about this movie. Disappointing.

    H.E. Bates has never really been a popular author in the cinema- there have been far more adaptations of his works on television- but in 1995 there appeared both "A Month by the Lake" and "The Feast of July", the first feature films based on his writings since "Dulcima" and "The Triple Echo" in the early seventies. The reason why these two films both came out at that time is doubtless the temporary revival of interest in his works provoked by "The Darling Buds of May", the highly popular television adaptation of his "Larkin Family" series of comic novels. "A Month by the Lake", based on a story from Bates' collection "The Grapes of Paradise", is set in the Italy of the 1930s; to be precise, by Lake Como in April 1937, the very month in which Edward Fox, one of its stars, was born. Rather unusually in a youth-obsessed cinema, its theme is the growth of love between two middle-aged people, both British guests at an elegant lakeside hotel. Miss Bentley is a spinster who, on the first day of her month's holiday, meets Major Wilshaw, a retired Army officer. This is not, however, a straightforward romance. Even in middle age the path of love does not always run smoothly, and complications arise in the shape of two other characters. Miss Beaumont, an American nanny working for a rich Italian family, flirts shamelessly with the Major. Vittorio, a handsome young Italian, flirts equally shamelessly with both Miss Bentley and Miss Beaumont. (Vittorio, incidentally, is the only major character whose Christian name we discover. The others, in keeping with Anglo-Saxon conventions of this era, address each other by their titles and surnames alone. Perhaps Italians were more relaxed about such matters). This film is considerably better than the film version of "The Feast of July", which turns a fine novel into a dull piece of rustic gloom and misery, but it does have its faults. The action tends to drag at times, particularly in the first half. The character of the Major changes rather abruptly; at first he seems like a rude, petulant man, especially after Miss Bentley beats him at tennis, and then suddenly becomes charming towards her. It is something of a convention in comedies such as "I Love Trouble" and "You've Got Mail" that all love affairs begin with hatred at first sight, but "A Month by the Lake" is a drama, a genre which has generally demanded a greater degree of psychological realism than has romantic comedy. Nevertheless, it is also a film which has its virtues. It may fall within the "heritage cinema" category but, despite the beauties of the scenery, it is not as visually lavish as some examples of the genre. It not only visually but also emotionally subtle. This type of cinema often demands a rather different style of acting technique than does contemporary drama for the reason that earlier generations, particularly but not only in Britain, often valued emotional self-control (the so-called "stiff upper lip") as a virtue, far more than most people would today. To display strong emotions, especially in public, was seen as a sign of weakness. To play "heritage cinema" well, therefore, demands the ability to display emotional states though subtle behavioural or verbal nuances rather than through overt histrionics. Uma Thurman, as Miss Beaumont, seems more at home here than she did in her earlier venture into historical drama, "Dangerous Liaisons". Roger Ebert points out that her character's surname means "beautiful mountain", but unlike Ebert I do not think that this is a reference to Thurman's physical height. Bates, after all, died in 1974, never knowing that his story would be filmed or that such a tall actress would be chosen to play the character. I think that he chose the name to emphasise that Miss Beaumont, beneath a surface playfulness, is inwardly cold and icy, and this is something which Thurman suggests well. Miss Bentley and Wilshaw, by contrast, hide strong emotions beneath an outward reticence. Like most British film actors of their generation (they were born within a few months of each other in 1937) Edward Fox and Vanessa Redgrave are both practised stars of historical drama- Redgrave, for example, starred in "Agatha" and Fox in "The Shooting Party"- , both possess the gift of being able to express emotion and mood subtly, and both make full use of that gift here. The result is a quiet, understated film, but nevertheless a very good one. 7/10

    Wonderful story... great acting. If you love the Lake Como area of northern Italy this is for you. A special relationship develops between a man and a woman driven by something much deeper than the lust that permeates most of today's movie-making. Edward Fox is simply magnificent and Ms. Redgrave is at her best. The tranquility of the time will amaze you. The world outside seems to be quickly falling apart as life goes on for the people in the film. If you want to enjoy a few moments of fun with a clever, delightful film this will be perfect. The place in which they are staying does exist but not as a Hotel. If you want to know why people like George Clooney fell in love with Lake Como, see this film. It captured my wife and I from the very beginning. Hollywood is rediscovering this region of Italy. (the Hotel in this movie is the place where Bond recovers from attack in Casino Royale and also part of a Stars movie)

    And for me, that's what movies are all about, whether it be the Disney Cinderella that was my first movie ever, or this last, A Month by the Lake, that is the place I want to be, in some other realm outside my own experience. And this movie fulfills that desire on many fronts and also kept me guessing from beginning to end. The performances of the cast were extraordinary in the most difficult of materials, an understated script and the repressive natures of the leads. Vanessa Redgrave -playing Miss Bentley, a beyond middle-age spinster of uncertain age - does much with this. In her outwardly almost flirtatious behaviour you catch the loneliness within, but barely. You determine she does have an interest in pursuing the major, she hears his voice in a dining room and then goes in slow pursuit but practically stands him up on the first 'date' and for no earthly reason we can determine. Edward Fox - playing Major Wilsaw a retired colonel from WW1 - has the major down pat, the peacocky walk, the clipped sentences, the fear lurking behind the eyes, all embodying the pre-war world of 1937 in Italy on Lake Como. Uma Thurman, in one of her first 'airings' plays Miss Beaumont, a young woman taking a position as a nanny to a wealthy Italian family staying at the same resort as Miss Bentley and Major Wilshaw who flirts one thinks rather cruelly with the Major leading him on in boredom but does she, we wonder, when the movie takes off in unexpected directions. Vanessa is sexy and wonderful, you sense there is an unstated other life underlying her character as there is with Major Wilshaw. Uma is the ing&eacute;nue of a kind, an unmanageable young woman, incorrigible as another era would have it, sent to straighten herself out in Europe far away from disgracing her family in America. She is the innocent abroad, or is she. She assumes an avid interest in the photographs Miss Bentley takes of the young man in love with Miss Bentley (a scene contrived by Miss Bentley) and is astounded at Miss Bentley's capacity to captivate. It meanders along from there with beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable tennis game. Too slow moving for many tastes. Wonderful eccentric characters - too odd for some - played to the hilt by a stellar cast. 8 out of 10.

This film is considerably better than the film version of "The Feast of July", which turns a fine novel into a dull piece of rustic gloom and misery, but it does have its faults. The action tends to drag at times, particularly in the first half. The character of the Major changes rather abruptly; at first he seems like a rude, petulant man, especially after Miss Bentley beats him at tennis, and then suddenly becomes charming towards her. It is something of a convention in comedies such as "I Love Trouble" and "You've Got Mail" that all love affairs begin with hatred at first sight, but "A Month by the Lake" is a drama, a genre which has generally demanded a greater degree of psychological realism than has romantic comedy. Nevertheless, it is also a film which has its virtues. It may fall within the "heritage cinema" category but, despite the beauties of the scenery, it is not as visually lavish as some examples of the genre. It not only visually but also emotionally subtle. This type of cinema often demands a rather different style of acting technique than does contemporary drama for the reason that earlier generations, particularly but not only in Britain, often valued emotional self-control (the so-called "stiff upper lip") as a virtue, far more than most people would today. To display strong emotions, especially in public, was seen as a sign of weakness. To play "heritage cinema" well, therefore, demands the ability to display emotional states though subtle behavioural or verbal nuances rather than through overt histrionics. Uma Thurman, as Miss Beaumont, seems more at home here than she did in her earlier venture into historical drama, "Dangerous Liaisons". Roger Ebert points out that her character's surname means "beautiful mountain", but unlike Ebert I do not think that this is a reference to Thurman's physical height. Bates, after all, died in 1974, never knowing that his story would be filmed or that such a tall actress would be chosen to play the character. I think that he chose the name to emphasise that Miss Beaumont, beneath a surface playfulness, is inwardly cold and icy, and this is something which Thurman suggests well. Miss Bentley and Wilshaw, by contrast, hide strong emotions beneath an outward reticence. Like most British film actors of their generation (they were born within a few months of each other in 1937) Edward Fox and Vanessa Redgrave are both practised stars of historical drama- Redgrave, for example, starred in "Agatha" and Fox in "The Shooting Party"- , both possess the gift of being able to express emotion and mood subtly, and both make full use of that gift here. The result is a quiet, understated film, but nevertheless a very good one. 7/10

    Wonderful story... great acting. If you love the Lake Como area of northern Italy this is for you. A special relationship develops between a man and a woman driven by something much deeper than the lust that permeates most of today's movie-making. Edward Fox is simply magnificent and Ms. Redgrave is at her best. The tranquility of the time will amaze you. The world outside seems to be quickly falling apart as life goes on for the people in the film. If you want to enjoy a few moments of fun with a clever, delightful film this will be perfect. The place in which they are staying does exist but not as a Hotel. If you want to know why people like George Clooney fell in love with Lake Como, see this film. It captured my wife and I from the very beginning. Hollywood is rediscovering this region of Italy. (the Hotel in this movie is the place where Bond recovers from attack in Casino Royale and also part of a Stars movie)

    And for me, that's what movies are all about, whether it be the Disney Cinderella that was my first movie ever, or this last, A Month by the Lake, that is the place I want to be, in some other realm outside my own experience. And this movie fulfills that desire on many fronts and also kept me guessing from beginning to end. The performances of the cast were extraordinary in the most difficult of materials, an understated script and the repressive natures of the leads. Vanessa Redgrave -playing Miss Bentley, a beyond middle-age spinster of uncertain age - does much with this. In her outwardly almost flirtatious behaviour you catch the loneliness within, but barely. You determine she does have an interest in pursuing the major, she hears his voice in a dining room and then goes in slow pursuit but practically stands him up on the first 'date' and for no earthly reason we can determine. Edward Fox - playing Major Wilsaw a retired colonel from WW1 - has the major down pat, the peacocky walk, the clipped sentences, the fear lurking behind the eyes, all embodying the pre-war world of 1937 in Italy on Lake Como. Uma Thurman, in one of her first 'airings' plays Miss Beaumont, a young woman taking a position as a nanny to a wealthy Italian family staying at the same resort as Miss Bentley and Major Wilshaw who flirts one thinks rather cruelly with the Major leading him on in boredom but does she, we wonder, when the movie takes off in unexpected directions. Vanessa is sexy and wonderful, you sense there is an unstated other life underlying her character as there is with Major Wilshaw. Uma is the ing&eacute;nue of a kind, an unmanageable young woman, incorrigible as another era would have it, sent to straighten herself out in Europe far away from disgracing her family in America. She is the innocent abroad, or is she. She assumes an avid interest in the photographs Miss Bentley takes of the young man in love with Miss Bentley (a scene contrived by Miss Bentley) and is astounded at Miss Bentley's capacity to captivate. It meanders along from there with beautiful cinematography and an unforgettable tennis game. Too slow moving for many tastes. Wonderful eccentric characters - too odd for some - played to the hilt by a stellar cast. 8 out of 10.

    For 16 years Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave) has been spending April at an elegant hillside villa on Lake Como. It's 1937, and her father has recently died. It was going to be an uneventful vacation and then Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox) arrives. Add to the mix is Miss Beaumont (Uma Thurman), a tall, flirtatious, sassy, young American. It's all fun and games to her, but her affects are much more powerful than she realizes. It's a breezy film at first like the countryside setting. It is where the rich set vacation. There's some attempts at slapstick with the tennis game. The Italians are mostly cartoonish. Vanessa is easy going. Uma is flashy. When the specter of jealousy arise, the story finally gets going. Instead of using this emotional drama, the story ends and it's wrapped up with a happy ending. It lacks any tension or power. Vanessa Redgrave makes it watchable. It's just a slow watch.

    It seems like a good baby=boomer escapist package: Redgrave, Fox, Thurman, but take a director who's unsuited to romantic meringues, a cast with no chemistry, and a script in which so little happens that a month by the lake seems stretch into a decade; and you're in trouble. Edward Fox seems sensible casting as the correct British major, but he's awkward, unconvincing, and made to play most scenes too large or too thin. Ms Redgrave, despite the 1937 setting is wearing clothes she bought in Hampstead last week, and carries on like an over-excited schoolgirl. Perhaps all the fun was contained within the set. She's unconvincing, as is her relationship with Mr Fox, which, unfortunately is the glue of the story. Her rival for his affections is Uma Thurman, who distinguishes herself by giving a misguided reading of every line she has to utter. She can't even wave goodbye convincingly. Every moment she's on screen is excruciatingly wrong. The director takes a cack-handed approach to the tone of almost every scene; the structure is awkward, and even the close-ups of the two leads are unflattering and clumsy - especially those of Mr Fox. Alida Valli, manages to be Irvin-proof; Nicola Piovani provides some sweet, schmaltzy music and Pasqualino de Santis's photography is very pretty.

    In 1937 Miss Bentley (Vanessa Redgrave 58) summers at lake Como at a hotel she has spent the summer at for 16 years. There she meets Major Wilshaw (Edward Fox 58) and the other main character in this triangle Miss Beaumont (Urma Thurman 28). Bentley is a delightful cheerful character single and is interested in the fusty Major Wilshaw. He in turn has eyes for the 28 year old Miss Beaumont who strings him along in a sadistic way. I guess the only thing that occurred to me is why Miss Bentley would be interested in Major Wilshaw a rather unattractive short man (Redgrave is still rather attractive at 58)...if they had cast someone a bit more handsome than Fox... but then it helps delineate the themes of the story better and makes Miss Beaumont's sadistic flirting much more believable. The first time I saw the movie in 1995 I didn't like Redgrave's Bentley character but this time I did the movie was much better the second time. Something about her hyper flighty too good to be true nature seemed contrived the first time but not really the second? I have aged 15 years and am 59 myself now maybe that is part of it. The movie has a little of the requisite anti fascist political pounding going on from time to time but it is restrained thank God--it would have ruined a well done little story. Good movie watch it.

    I do not understand the people that say this is a good movie. I guess the potential is there... but it flopped big time. The only good thing about this movie is Redgrave. Oh yeah... and the hot young Italian she shuns... Storyline: older lady likes older man. Older man likes younger woman. Younger woman leads on older man. Audience falls asleep. Why anyone likes the older man is beyond comprehension. He is unattractive in so many ways. He has one of the most unlikeable personalities ever. And I don't mean that you will come to understand his quirky ways later in the movie... you don't. He is just as unlikeable in the end as he is in the beginning. Ms. Redgraves character is so enamored with him for NO reason at all. I don't understand it. He is not witty, polite, smart, anything... ick. Uma's character is pointless, mean and well... pointless and mean. Maybe the book was better than the movie. The movie stunk.

    Honestly, what a disappointment. Every. Single. Sentence. Spoken. Like. This. S-l-o-w-l-y. It made me just about jump out of my skin (and I can watch a four-hour silent movie without losing interest for a minute). I haven't written a review here in ages, but this movie needs a warning label. I've seen all three of the stars give fabulous performances so it must have been the director. Here, Redgrave's performance is so weird I couldn't figure out what she thought she was doing. Fox and Thurman could not have known what they were entrusting to the film stock-- performances in an acting style from the distant past...only slower. And the story is so clich&eacute;d - out-of-date clich&eacute;s, not even current ones! - that it was painful to watch. There *can't* be any spoilers, the only element of surprise being that you can't believe the filmmakers would actually dare do anything so obvious. Watch "Enchanted April" for what this might have been.

    Warning: Spoilers of sorts. Beautiful, lush sets and scenery. Characterizations of oddball characters bounce all over the map. Uneven direction from a director whose right hand doesn't seem to know what his left hand is doing. Or care. Script is nothing to shout about either. Strangely non-affecting. Not especially amusing, not especially romantic, not even a little bit sexy. It's a bit of a mystery why the two main characters are attracted to one another or why they end up together. Odd, off-hand treatment of impending war. A collection of truly bizarre performances. Normally reliable actors run amok. No doubt the director's and screenwriter's faults. A film that tries hard, very hard, too hard and doesn't succeed. Can't really recommend, but on the other hand, it's not a complete waste of time. It apparently has its audience.

    It is 1937, and a spunky spinster (Vanessa Redgrave) is spending a month at a villa on Lake Como. There she meets and is intrigued by a pompous old major (Edward Fox). He, on the other hand, has eyes only for a lovely but cruel young nanny (Uma Thurmon). How could a movie about beautiful Lake Como and a lovelorn English lady go wrong? Apparently, very easily. This terribly-misguided movie has a juvenile script, hammy actors, and poor direction. Even the wardrobe, makeup, and hairdos are way off, looking like contemporary styles rather than pre-WWII. The attraction between the spinster and the major is never explained and their bantering is off-putting as well as boring. Thurmon over-enunciates every syllable and shouts like she's doing a (bad) high school play. None of the stars is believable in their roles. Despite the picturesque location, there's absolutely nothing romantic about this movie. Disappointing.

    H.E. Bates has never really been a popular author in the cinema- there have been far more adaptations of his works on television- but in 1995 there appeared both "A Month by the Lake" and "The Feast of July", the first feature films based on his writings since "Dulcima" and "The Triple Echo" in the early seventies. The reason why these two films both came out at that time is doubtless the temporary revival of interest in his works provoked by "The Darling Buds of May", the highly popular television adaptation of his "Larkin Family" series of comic novels. "A Month by the Lake", based on a story from Bates' collection "The Grapes of Paradise", is set in the Italy of the 1930s; to be precise, by Lake Como in April 1937, the very month in which Edward Fox, one of its stars, was born. Rather unusually in a youth-obsessed cinema, its theme is the growth of love between two middle-aged people, both British guests at an elegant lakeside hotel. Miss Bentley is a spinster who, on the first day of her month's holiday, meets Major Wilshaw, a retired Army officer. This is not, however, a straightforward romance. Even in middle age the path of love does not always run smoothly, and complications arise in the shape of two other characters. Miss Beaumont, an American nanny working for a rich Italian family, flirts shamelessly with the Major. Vittorio, a handsome young Italian, flirts equally shamelessly with both Miss Bentley and Miss Beaumont. (Vittorio, incidentally, is the only major character whose Christian name we discover. The others, in keeping with Anglo-Saxon conventions of this era, address each other by their titles and surnames alone. Perhaps Italians were more relaxed about such matters). This film is considerably better than the film version of "The Feast of July", which turns a fine novel into a dull piece of rustic gloom and misery, but it does have its faults. The action tends to drag at times, particularly in the first half. The character of the Major changes rather abruptly; at first he seems like a rude, petulant man, especially after Miss Bentley beats him at tennis, and then suddenly becomes charming towards her. It is something of a convention in comedies such as "I Love Trouble" and "You've Got Mail" that all love affairs begin with hatred at first sight, but "A Month by the Lake" is a drama, a genre which has generally demanded a greater degree of psychological realism than has romantic comedy. Nevertheless, it is also a film which has its virtues. It may fall within the "heritage cinema" category but, despite the beauties of the scenery, it is not as visually lavish as some examples of the genre. It not only visually but also emotionally subtle. This type of cinema often demands a rather different style of acting technique than does contemporary drama for the reason that earlier generations, particularly but not only in Britain, often valued emotional self-control (the so-called "stiff upper lip") as a virtue, far more than most people would today.
