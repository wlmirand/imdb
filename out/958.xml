    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum. Line added to meet silly 10-line requirement. Line added to meet silly 10-line requirement. Line added to meet silly 10-line requirement. Line added to meet silly 10-line requirement.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace.

There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    While the story might not vibrate with some, this is the entry point in adulthood for this particular director. Starting with his big screen debut he has struggled to reach a voice, a certain signature every important director has in order to have his work recognizable. From a first movie presented as a collage of different famous works and styles he finally reaches the ability to control the composition of a scene or master the use of light to bring a certain depth to a flat screen, thus opening the way for his future works. Too bad that he shows a turn to the commercial side of the cinematography in his last works. But for this one: Well done!

    This is the best movie that I have ever seen. I watched this movie because I was taking a class on the politics of China. When I saw that this movie covered such an expansive time period I thought "great, I will learn something." That I did. I cried, I cheered, I stayed up very late... I made my then future husband watch it... he liked it too, not as much as I do. I tell everyone in conversations about movies that this one is my all time favorite. It took the place of American Beauty, a movie that I have watched about eleven times. So, I recommend it. If I had a lot of money I would pay people to watch this. It is THAT great.

    Every person interprets films in his own way, and for me To Live is about economic growth. Before elaborating on this statement, I would like to acknowledge that another visitor of IMDb recommended this film to me, in response to my inquiries. So the message board actually works. You see, economic growth always comes at a price. This is especially clear from the film scene, where the peasants melt down their pans in order to provide steel for the construction of factories (or, less productive, for cannon balls). In fact, the hardship of the Chinese couple is not worse than the life of the Joads family in The Grapes of Wrath. Remember that in Oklahoma and California the Joads family became the victim of agricultural rationalizations. Nor is Chinese family worse off than the Flemish peasant in Het Gezin van Paemel. It reminds us to keep an open mind, when looking at films like To live. The interesting part is its portrayal of Chinese history and of course its Chinese origin. Apparently, Chinese film makers have a reasonable freedom of expression. As a cinematic product, it is less impressive: an ordinary story, plain dialogs, scanty acting. But we are fascinated by this enormous country, of which we know so little. In addition we realize our own dismal past, contemplating the imperialist attacks on China of a century ago. In 1900 all western powers contributed to the cruel eradication of the nationalist Boxer uprise. The film starts with the victory of Mao's army around 1948, which was probably a positive development. Note however that it was a peasants revolution and not a socialist one. Being a democratic socialist, I would like to point out, that socialist arrangements are only possible in a fully developed state. For the collective arrangements in socialism require a high degree of civilization and democracy. Unfortunately in his later years Mao began to experiment. First, from 1958 to 1962 he tried to implement a fully decentralized economy during the so-called Great Leap Forward. Interestingly, by that time the American government had prohibited its citizens to enter China (a kind of Chinese Wall). Then in 1966-1969 Mao tried to change the social habits in the Cultural revolution. One of the aims was a high level of equality and the integration of the intellectual class into the peasant class. As an ideology it has its merits, and in fact some of the offsprings in the west still have an exemplary value. On the other hand, in the primitive Chinese society it was inefficient, a waste of talent and an invitation to brutality. It is said that in those years three million people were murdered. I assume that this was not what Mao and his staff had in mind. In 1976 (the year of Mao's decease) Joris Ivens made several interesting documentaries on collective managements, for instance of a pharmacist (La pharmacie No.3: Shanghai) and of a school (Une histoire de ballon). Nevertheless, during the reign of Mao the social indicators were continuously rising, and (considering the poverty) the health insurance and education were excellent. Whereas in 1950 the average life expectancy was 34 years, in 1990 it had risen to 70 (!) years. On the aspect of economic growth, but also on many social issues the collective China has outperformed the more capitalist India. Note also the fundamental quality, that the Maoist system is able to reform itself from within. It is clear that the rule of the Maoist party has had its merits, and these must be considered in the evaluation of the story line in To Live. I guess we have the right to criticize the Maoist policy with respect to human rights. However, it seems out of place to claim a moral superiority. It is certainly obvious, that in a comparison of the contemporary living conditions in China the results of the deep involvement of the western countries in both Africa and South-America looks relatively poor.

    My disbelief resisted suspension. For one thing, no wife, anywhere, would be dumb (or masochistic) enough to return to such an irredeemable reprobate. Also, since Everyman's misery was self-inflicted, he never seemed worthy of redemption. The scenes of the Civil War seemed gratuitous plot-padding. I could go on, but to my taste, Japanese movies of the 1950s were much more subtle than this episodic, overambitious oeurve manqu&eacute;. De gustibus non est disputandum.

    Title: Huozhe (To Live) Directed by Yimou Zhang Released: 1994 To Live is a powerful drama set in mainland China which highlights many of the ills associated with the various changes in Chinese society during the mid-20th Century. The story spans across four of the most dramatic decades of political, social, and economic reform in Chinese history. Each decade encapsulates a particular event of Chinese socio-political upheaval. The film begins during the Civil war, leading into the midst of the 'Great Leap Forward', followed by the Cultural Revolution. The film follows the lives of Fugui, his wife Jiazhen, and their children Fengxia and Youqing, and depicts the manner in which Chinese families had to cope and adapt to the drastic upheaval in order to avoid being labelled a "capitalist" or a "reactionary" and suffer retribution. The family have to constantly change and reaffirm their identities in a desperate attempt to avoid reprisal. Sadly, as the story demonstrates this is something that in such a stirring time simply cannot be avoided. The Director, Yimou Zhang, utilizes fade shots to suggest the passing of time, the contrast between rich and dull backdrops to imply certain moods, the grandiose landscapes to symbolize isolation, and puts great emphasis upon the symbolism of the shadow puppetry scenes which are heightened by fire illuminating the canvas screen from behind. Fugui is a gambling addict in denial. He is confronted by his wife Jiazhen, a strong, devoted, and selfless woman, with the choice of either giving up gambling and joining her in leading a simple life with their daughter Fengxia, who after a childhood illness becomes a partially deaf mute, or to continue his current lifestyle alone. Youqing, the youngest member of the family, is mischievous and likable and while his father is away, develops a very strong attachment to his mother and his sister. Throughout the film the couple are forced to adapt to the rapid social changes around them in order to protect their family. Their agency as human beings is rendered down to the point where their foremost priority is to follow the majority and keep a low profile, while the fear of reprisal and becoming a target of the community leads the two to blame one another or themselves for the ills bestowed upon them by the socio-political situation in which they find themselves living. In one such instance Youqing stands up against three children who are bullying Fengxia and wrestles the main perpetrator to the ground. Later at a communal meal, Youqing pours a large bowl of hot noodles laced with a healthy quantity of chilli sauce over the head of the instigator stinging his eyes. Fugui tries to restore calm to the situation but the other boys' father claims he is a "counterrevolutionary". Fearing retribution of his sons' actions, Fugui feels compelled to publicly administer a thorough flogging upon Youqing. Fugui was unaware of the events which led to his son acting in such a way, but it is safe to say that regardless of whether he did or not know he would have had to have done the same. Having seen first-hand the hysteria that had gripped the public and how quickly such a seemingly insignificant accusation could suddenly lead to the masses calling for ones' head (the execution of Long'er), there was little else he could do. The two major personal tragedies the couple suffer are the deaths of their two children. The responsibility & circumstances of both deaths can be attributed to the shortcomings of the misguided political regimes during which they each passed. Firstly, Youqing, who at the age of 6 is sent out to work as requested by the government so the township can meet their steel production quota. The boy, having been overworked, has not slept in 3 days and is allowed to have a nap behind a concrete wall. The wall is struck by the district chief's jeep, which then topples over on top of the boy crushing him to death. In a strange twist of fate the District Chief responsible for the premature death of Youqing is Chunsheng - a friend of Fugui's from the civil war and the days of his shadow puppet troupe. Guilt-stricken, Chunsheng frequently offers the couple money as compensation. Jiazhen, out of principle and anger towards Chunsheng, does not accept the money, whereas Fugui does not accept the money in order to maintain his working class appearance. The fear of being labelled a "capitalist" certainly plays on his mind which could lead to him being imprisoned or even executed. The second instance is decades later when their only remaining child is giving birth to their grandchild. Because of the 'great leap forward' where educated peoples were persecuted there were no doctors at hand to care for their daughter during childbirth. They raise this issue with her husband, a leader of the Red Guard, so he collects a specialist from the detention centre to overlook proceedings. The specialist is visibly weak from starvation and stuffs himself full of steamed buns which ultimately incapacitate him when he is needed most. Fengxia, shortly after the birth begins to haemorrhage, but because there are no doctors in the hospital, and only students, nobody knows what to do to save her, which results in Fengxia slowly bleeding to death, dying silently in her mother's arms. The film makes one question whether these dramatic social upheavals were ultimately worth the tragedies so many families must have suffered and endured over the course of those four decades. Fugui throughout most of the film appears unassured by the direction China is heading, but supports the majority out of fear and for the safety of himself and his family. Towards the end of the film however, despite the horrendous losses he and his wife have suffered, Fugui appears genuinely convinced that society is moving forward and for the better of the new generations.

    ...to describe how beautiful and nearly flawless this film is. This is like a feast for a person starving for good cinema, good storytelling, and flawless acting. Like THE JOY LUCK CLUB, it is an epic, an emotional banquet. Fugui (You Ge) and his wife Jiazhen (the incomparable Gong Li) are young parents expecting their second child within a few months. They are financially well off and living comfortably, but Fugui has a terrible addiction to all night gambling. Soon enough, he has lost everything the family owns, and they are paupers overnight. Jiazhen takes their daughter Fengxia and leaves Fugui devastated. He also loses his father to a heart attack and his mother is ailing. He is forced to take lodging in a crummy apartment and just try to get his life back together, becoming a street peddler, then a performer of shadow puppetry. Jiazhen decides to give Fugui one more chance, and seeing as he has nothing left to gamble away, things begin to look up. Until one night, during one of Fugui's puppet shows, he and his troupe are caught up in the civil war against the Liberation Army (pre- communism). A prisoner of war for months, he becomes an entertainer for the Army, and then set free to go home. With a new government in power, Fugui and Jiazhen begin yet another attempt to rebuild. This movie is neither pro nor anti communism. It is simply the portrait of a family caught up in times of tremendous change. A decade later, the family has merged into the mission of Chairman Mao, helping with steel production and eating in communist canteens instead of cooking their own meals. All scrap metal is donated to the cause, and even the children are expected to work long, hard hours smelting, lest their families be thought of as "politically backward." They live their lives in happy anxiety, glad to be alive and together, but always wary of offending someone who could punish them. Fengxia has been left mute by a fever some years prior, and her younger brother Youquin meets with a heart-wrenching tragedy at this time. Two decades after the film begins, China has taken the Great Leap. Fengxia is growing up, and her family introduces her to kindhearted Erxi. They marry and soon are expecting, but more tragedy is in store. The ending of this film is open to discussion, but basically the point is, life is not a destination, it's a journey. Who knows what becomes of this family after the credits? What are their hopes of the future? They were once a rich family, and it's unlikely they'll ever be rich again. Do they even care at this point? After the tragic losses of their children, how do they have the strength "to live" on? Perhaps because Erxi, who has stayed near them in spite of his own tremendous loss, and because of their grandson, who lived after Fengxia died in childbirth. Perhaps that precious child, that "Little Bun" is all it takes to motivate them to keep going. In the face of loss and tragedy, a new blessing makes all the difference. People need something to hope for and dream for, otherwise it would all seem so pointless. For all its richness and tapestry, To Live carries a simple and universal message about the strength of the human spirit and the will "to live."

    To Live is one of the strongest films by Zhang Yimou. I found it much more entertaining than Red Sorghum, Ju Dou and even Raise the Red Lantern. To Live is an epic story about how people deal with times changing and the consequences of it. It's a story we all can relate to, even if we haven't lived in China. To Live in many respects reminded me a lot of Doctor Zhivago. There are some similar themes and some of the plot points are somewhat similar at times. The story covers the most important events that took place from late 1940's to 1970's. It's great history lesson for those who don't know much about history of modern China or how communism affects people. This story greatly benefits from the fact that there are very strong and smart characters. Their only motivation is to live in peace. They don't seek problems or try to fight the system. All they want is to live their lives and make due with what they have. It also helps a lot that the acting is superb. Ge You and Gong Li carry the film with their strong performances. They have excellent material to work with and bring a lot of emotion and power to their performances. The supporting performances were all around excellent. Hard to complain about the acting. To Live is less impressive visually as the previous films by Zhang Yimou. Yes, it looks great and the period details are great and it's very well paced for the most part. The first 30 minutes are slow and a bit clunky but after that. it never struggles with the pace. I also liked the fact that they found a way how to criticize communism in a way that didn't feel forced. Our characters never outright say that communism is bad or wrong, we just see how they deal with it and it's up to us to evaluate the situation for ourselves. There was only one thing that bothered me a lot. And it's Gong Li... She doesn't age well in this film and it's kind of distracting. I know that she is immortal and never aging but for this film they should have found a way to show that her character ages. That's small problem but can take you of the film sometimes. To Live is a really good film and should be seen by anyone who are fan of foreign cinema and fans of the work of Zhang Yimou and Gong Li. It's more accessible for mainstream audience and offers us a epic story about the common people and how they struggle to find happiness and peace in the ever changing world.

    As much as I have been transported by some of Zhang's epics in the way he manages to play with that kind of feeling and develops an interesting sense in the beauty of the images through colorful surroundings, graceful gestures and the the sometimes tragic intensity of themes of the ancient mystified past of the Chinese culture. As much as I cherish those attempts, I must say the book, from which this story is profiled, is entirely prominent on a variety of aspects. For a start, the main character shows a completely different behavior throughout the original story. At the beginning, for example of demonstration to the comparison I am making, he shows himself much more arrogant and unconscious. That attitude is an important factor that leads him more naturally to be an easy prey for this gambling that has become a fierce influence. And it heats up his mind in a rhythm almost like a trance of forgetfulness. Also it is said that the head of the gambling house is playing with him in a more subtle way, that the dices were loaded and that the game is set much more viciously against him, that he is on longer run of being manipulated thats it shows on the screen. Hence When he realizes that he's at the end of the road, that he has lost everything, he doesn't start crying like a little boy going "oh no what have I done and so on", no, the realization comes on to him like a heavy burden of unspeakable knowledge of the consequences he mindlessly ignored until it fell on him in single overpowering blow, and that is mostly how it happens with a lot human mistakes and which gives a sense reality to it, if you mind my experience on many materials related to this given fact. Even with the necessity to squeeze out the script many events thus making it possible to turn the initial story into a 2 hour film (at least for a challenge such as this one), a lot misjudging was avoidable on that part. I could go on and on about the important details that have been so mindlessly ignored and that washed the essential core of this heart ripping story, and yet it is full of fleeting joy through what seems to be an endless downfall of bitter events that strikes this man and his family. This film is like a bad Walt Disney version of it's original form, it's too much of a sentimentalist view to hook onto the historical veracity to which junctions the credibility of the tale, also the conditions the characters go through by what they confront should show noticeable side effects which a bit light on the screen. Thus the initial dimension of the characters has been sterilized by these severe lacks. If all those components had been more seriously followed then there is no doubt this adaptation could have reached a totally different result on its quality scale and it really is just a shame.

    Every life is bound to be born and last in a certain period. This film tells a story of a husband（Fugui) and a wife(Jiazhen) and how how they manage to live through China's tumultuous periods. The time line of the story is quite long. It starts from China's civil war to the Emancipation of China and then to the times of great leap forward and finally to the cultural revolution till its end. As for the characters, the status of Fugui and Jiazhen also changes from landlord to peasant. Due to the habit of gambling, Fugui lost all fortunes of the family, which accidentally saves his family as, with the communist party coming into power, they become peasants and avoid the fate of being killed. Later on, their son dies of an accident when melting irons in the times of great leap forward when all metals of every family are collected to produce irons. Their daughter dies of hemorrhoid when delivering her baby during cultural revolution when all the doctors and professionals are criticized and replaced by Red Guards who are not equipped with sufficient medical knowledge. To a large extent, the fate of Fugui's family is beyond the control of themselves. As opposed to an era, one person's life is like a grain of corn in the wild sea. However, no matter how harsh the living environment is, they make efforts to live because only when alive, one can feel hope. As the old sayings goes, it is better to live indecently than to die decently. In one word, what the common people need fundamentally is to live.

    "This piece of art is an epic family drama." If i read reviews like this, i usually think of over-the-top artsy movies with weird acting, unrealistic dialogs and long shots at clocks or stones that no person in his right mind, who is not a complete movie buff would voluntarily sit through. To all you "normal" people, who are afraid of just this: This is not one of those movies. It's no popcorn cinema, but it's still highly entertaining in its own way. The story is gripping, the acting is nothing short of marvelous (Ge You and Gong Li deserve every prize there is for their performances) and the dialogs are simply ...real. It makes you laugh out loud and it makes you cry (there'll be more crying than laughing going on, though) To me, it's a perfect movie, that might just change your perspective on life. However, you will be able to enjoy this masterpiece more thoroughly, if you get yourself acquainted with Chinese history from the 1930s to the 1970s, and while you're at it try to dive into Chinese culture itself real quick as well ^_^ Trust me, you will be able to enjoy this movie much more, if you know more than "well, the commies took over in '49 and then there was this cultural revolution, i guess". If you don't have all that background information, you'll probably still think of it as a great movie, but you're going to miss some of the subtle social commentary and will not recognize the importance of some of the plot devices. So you might want to check out wikipedia or a history book beforehand; or maybe even the novel itself, if you can get your hands on it. The novel is very good, too. But it does lack the optimistic fundamental note and the humor of the movie.
