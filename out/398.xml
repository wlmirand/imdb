    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    I'll be honest. I didn't grow up playing Mario Bros., and I really only know the basics about it. But everything about this is confusing, and not in a way that's worth deciphering. Instead of talking about the stupid movie, I will talk about how weird it is to see some of these actors though. Dennis Hopper becomes the villain in "Speed", Fiona Shaw is Aunt Petunia in "Harry Potter", Fisher Stevens goes on to be the neighbor in "Early Edition", and John Leguizamo grows up and becomes Sid in "Ice Age". While I can't say that all those people went on to better things, at least they all have the worst one in common. Very little of this movie was enjoyable. (Although I do love the waltzing Goombas a lot. Like, a lot.) It's a sad attempt to cash in on the Mario Bros. franchise and it's better off not existing.

    I'll make this quick, I would personally like to tell all the people giving this movie a bad rap "Shut up stupid!" Like the rest of us die hard fans that actually gave it the credit it deserves I love this movie! Although it is not as good as super Mario Brothers 3 the game, it did The best it could for a live action cartoon. I loved it as a child, and I still love it. Still to this day I wouldn't change a thing about it. The cast was absolutely perfect. John Leguizamo played a perfect Luigi. Bob Hoskins played a perfect Mario. And don't get me started on Dennis Hopper as King Koopa! I honestly think the people given this movie a bad rap are just lying because they're scared that their friends would make fun of them. Watch it again you'll love it!!!

    Everyone knows this movie is nothing like the games, so I'm not even going to bother complaining about that. Super Mario Bros (1993) is half awkward parody of the source material and half nightmare, the sum being an unpleasant science fiction adventure that proved to be an embarrassment for all involved. The movie looks ugly, the writing is lame, and the comedy uninspired. The only performances I can really recall are Bob Hoskins' Mario and Dennis Hopper as King Koopa (or Bowser, as he's known in the games today). Both ham it up, but you can tell they're having no fun here, probably reminding themselves there will be a nice fat paycheck once the horrible ordeal is over with. You might find the insanity fun if you're in the right frame of mind, but otherwise, I'd avoid this one if you wish to preserve your mental well-being.

    Don't click away yet, yes I get it is nothing like the game, but if you want the game then just go and play the game, this movie was made for kids and yes I get that kids don't even like this movie most of the time, but this movie had the too many cooks in the kitchen syndrome were if most people herd about and worked on the movie which I have only done the first of the two from cast interviews and articles on this movie, but I like to look at this movie in the same way I like to look at Commando a dumb but fun 80's movie, that I love but is dumb at certain parts, and like commando this movie isn't perfect either and the fact that it was left open, were instead they should have just tested waters without making any farther plans, and hey it's better then anything Uwe Boll ever crapped out.

    There were a number of questions I asked myself as I sat watching Super Mario Bros. "What the heck is going on?" "Is that really supposed to be Toad?" "Why is everyone acting like imbeciles?" "Why am I still watching this movie?" Nearly 2 hours of my life is gone, thanks to Super Mario Bros., a movie that does everything wrong and nothing right. A serious contender for worst movie ever made, though I'll grant; it had quite a few unintentional laughs. In a ludicrous plot that seems to be trying to make sense of the nonsensical world of the video game it's based upon, Super Mario Bros. is about two plumbers named Mario and Luigi (we're supposed to believe they're brothers, but they look at least 20 years apart in age), who find themselves in a different dimension. The dimension is ruled by a man, or dinosaur, or whatever he is, named King Koopa. From there on, there's something about a meteorite, de-evolution, and a big glob of living fungus. I couldn't even begin to mention every single mistake this movie made. I can only go over a handful of flaws in this review, but trust me; I could go on for days. Let's start with the plot, which I've briefly explained above. It's stupid, it's strange, and jammed with clich&eacute;s. Everything from henchmen that turn good, child being left on someone's doorstep, clumsy romance, etc. Much of the film feels like a live-action Saturday morning cartoon. In itself, that's not necessarily bad. In this case, believe me; it's bad. Gravity is defied, special effects are terrible, awful cinematography renders some parts of the film unwatchable at times. Need I say more? And yet, I haven't even scratched the surface. Characters are stupid and obvious things are overlooked. Tie-ins with the Mario games are forced and uncreative. Plot holes and continuity problems are everywhere. Does this film do anything right? While the characters' personalities are nothing like they are in the games, it's hard to blame the film for that. This film released in 1993, and at that point, none of the Mario characters had personality. Still, it should be noted that in the film, Luigi is the courageous one, and Mario is more cowardly (the opposite is true in the games). And speaking of Mario, his deep, harsh Brooklyn voice isn't at all the friendly voice we're used to hearing from the famous plumber, but once again, that's not really the film's fault, as no one had ever heard Mario speak before. The acting is relatively terrible. I'll just save time by saying all the performances are awful, with one exceptions. Bob Hoskins as Mario really isn't that bad. He makes the most out of what he's given to work with, and the result is a passable, painless performance. Alan Silverstri, what are you doing composing music for this film? You're better than this! It's depressing to see the composer of such classics like Back to the Future reduced to this. Still, the score is awful. The main theme is annoying, and there is no references from the original game's soundtrack in the score. There were lots of possibilities here, and Silverstri refuses to explore any of them. The dated soundtrack is a nightmare. Various pop songs of yesteryear are in this movie, and they all made me wince in pain. The exception here being "Walk the Dinosaur." I laughed when I heard this playing, because this song is also featured in Ice Age 3, another dinosaur-oriented film starring John Leguizamo (who's terrible in this film, by the way). Unwatchable, flawed, and laughably bad at times, Super Mario Bros. is an abomination. Forgetting everything that makes the Mario games enjoyable, Super Mario Bros. is a mess of fantastic proportions. It's unusual to see a film this bad. It's almost interesting. Maybe I should spend the next hour contemplating how awful this movie is. It will certainly be a much more entertaining way to spend my time than watching the movie was.

    Everyone knows Super Mario Brothers. The game was one of the best selling titles of the 80's and the games are still played to this day. So how well does it translate to film? In a nutshell, not very well but it's a wholeheartedly innocent attempt at any rate. I first saw the film at the Cinema when I was about 15 in 1993 and I came away sort of enjoying it. I think it's down to the fact that around that time people were becoming savvy to Hollywood botching film versions of established stories like comics and such. When I walked into that theatre I had absolutely no expectations about the film being true to the source material or any kind of notion that it would be really any good, and with that I sat down and was entertained for the duration. The bad points about the film is that is just dripping with studio exec. interference. This is a cheaply made film aimed at kids, not a kids film you understand. Goonies, Neverending Story etc. these are great kids films but a film aimed at kids is a whole different story. It's a gimmiky adventure film that bungles it's way through the story with a truly awful script, utterly dumbed down that's actually quite insulting to intelligent children. It's painful at times to see Dennis Hopper and Bob Hoskins, two of the great actors of modern time, deliver their goofy lines from the moronic screenplay. The film is cheap and it shows. Very bad special effects, sets and costumes don't add to the action but surprisingly it comes away with a certain feel which I found appealing. The goofy music that plays throughout and irritating 'boing' sound effects seal the coffin lid shut in a final insult to the viewers intelligence. Super Mario Brothers isn't a film you'd watch more than once, or even a guilty pleasure. It's the sort of film you would possibly put on to keep a bunch of 3 year old children happy for a bit. My review must seem scathing so far but I will say, it does have it's small moments. The Goomba (who looks nothing like their game counterparts) elevator scene just made me smile and certain scenes towards the beginning of the film seem genuine enough. As far as I know the director wanted to make the film much darker but was thwarted by the men in suits who wanted a kid friendly money maker and in knowing that I believe that the actors and crew did what they did with no malice intended and that sort of comes through a touch and this blameless feeling is what carries the film for the most part. I can't see how anyone could really hate this film, bad as it is!

    Very light, hardly specific spoilers included. Before I actually review the movie, I just want to say one thing. Divorce it. Divorce this movie from the Super Mario Bros. games, because if you don't, you'll probably hate it. Though terrible as an adaptation of the Nintendo games, as its own film, it's quite fun. No film based off a video game was ever great, but this is by far the best of a bad lot (watch Resident Evil or Street Fighter and you'll see what I mean). The acting by Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper is all great, save a handful of weird, but possibly intentional strange line deliveries by Hopper. Watch the movie carefully, and you'll notice many nods to the video games (and other movies like Doctor Zhivago and Back to the Future). The storyline and its many elements are also surprisingly original. In other words, the movie is good as long as you try not to think of it as a straight up 100% faithful adaptation of the video games.

    I can only describe "Super Mario Bros" the movie in one word. RIDICULOUS! The story is set in 90s Brooklyn - at first. The story follows the hysterical theory that the dinosaurs continue to thrive in another dimension. When Luigi Mario meets the girl of his dreams, his - and his brother Mario's - lives are turned upside down. They are sucked into this other dimension, where people eat lizards on hot dogs and buildings are consumed in fungus. The film holds many aspects of the video game series, including fungus swallowing up the kingdom, bob-ombs, bullet bills, spring loaded shoes, flame throwers, etc, with some visual gags, such as the "Wiggler" taxi, and the "Thwomp Club." References to Mario Kart, and Super Mario 64 are also made, in high-speed car chases, and icy rides down frozen tunnels. The most disappointing thing in this film was King Koopa (Bowser now-a-days)who did not even look like the character. His acting was dry and very Mel-Brookes esq. In the end, I gave this film 5/10 stars because I liked the idea, but I did not like how it was pulled off. This film could have gone places. It's a pity, considering how many Mario fans walked away feeling cheated out of short of two hours. 5/10

    Mario and Luigi must save both the world and Princess Daisy from the evil King Koopa who wants to take over the world. Let me first start off by saying that I've always been a fan of the Mario franchise. Mario Kart 64 (and DS), Mario Tennis, Super Smash bros (original, Melee, Brawl), Mario Party 1 and 2, Super Mario 64 (and DS), and the original Super Mario Bros were/are all fun and great games. When I first saw this movie, it was sometime in elementary school, possibly between 2nd and 5th grade (which would range from 1999-2003). When I was young, I wasn't into critiquing movies and TV shows, I would just watch them and enjoy them. I don't remember if I liked this one or not, but I got a chance to watch it again recently to see what I think of it after all these years and let me say this: I don't hate it. Let me get some of the stuff I didn't like first: the characters/script definitely could've been better. Some of the stuff they said, did, etc were either dumb or so dumb it was funny. I don't want to say the acting was horrible, maybe some of it wasn't that great, but for me it's hard to tell. I wish there were a few more fight scenes, like Mario and Luigi fighting off a group of Koopa's minions or something. I'm glad Yoshi was in the film, but why didn't he talk? At least he had his long tongue, though. While I was glad to see Mario and Luigi in their suits, I wish they put them on sooner. The plot about dinosaurs and merging dimensions didn't really sound so bad, but you would think there should've been a few more dinosaurs and references to the games. The part about the goombas having arms was interesting, but they could've tried to have them without arms like in the games. The way I see it, the filmmakers were just trying to make the film a little realistic with the goombas having arms and King Koopa and the others being human-like. I don't wanna say the failed at it, but they put some effort into it. Okay now for some things I liked (that's right, I said liked). Bob Hoskins, John Leguizamo, and Dennis Hopper are actors that I like, even though I've only seen Hoskins and Hopper in a couple movies. Dennis Hopper being the bad guy was actually an okay idea, since a year later he'll play the main bad guy in "Speed". Leguizamo and Hoskins being the Mario bros wasn't such a bad idea and I can't really think of anyone else who could've portrayed them. They did decent Italian-American accents. I thought the romance between Luigi and Daisy was alright. It was kinda funny how nervous he was when he and she first met, but I don't blame him. The special effects weren't that bad, some of it did look kind of cheesy. The goomba make-up/effect was interesting and I liked King Koopa's hair. There were a few spots that I laughed at, because I actually thought they were humorous. It was cool seeing a few mushrooms here and there and seeing a bomb-ob. The music didn't sound too bad and it was nice hearing the actual theme in the beginning. Overall, with its pros and cons, I actually think Super Mario Brothers is kind of a fun movie. After much thought, I give this film a C-. One more thing: I don't wanna bash the filmmakers for what they did to the movie, but if another group of filmmakers decides they want to remake/revamp the film, I hope they do better.

    I want to start off by saying that the Goombas are the best thing in this movie version of the Mario Bros. games. They are not very bright, but they have hearts of gold, they like to dance a lot, one of them carefully prepares vegetables for Princess Daisy (after she turns down meat), and another one knows how to play the Doctor Zhivago soundtrack on his harmonica. In other words, the goombas are likable and entertaining characters who provide a nice distraction from the rest of the film. But here's the thing. The goombas have only minor roles in this movie. Most of them are played by extras whose faces may never be known by the movie-going public. Sure they can boast at some nightclub, "Hey I played the most likable character in the Mario Bros film. I was a goomba." But how could he prove it? So if your only fond memory of the "Super Mario Bros." were those amusing, not very bright goombas, then you have just finished seeing a really bad film. To begin with, the sets for this film are terrible. I remember as a child that one of the things that attracted me to the Mario video games was the bright colours (large green hills, blue oceans), a plethora of evil critters (including ones that throw boomerangs at you), and having to run against a clock. But none of those things can be found in this Mario Bros. movie. The sets look like they came right out of a run down part of a big city that has witnessed record unemployment and skyrocketing crime. You would not leave your car there; you would not even drive your car there! But if the sets are too gloomy for words (and keep in mind I was having this sobering feeling when I was ten watching this movie. I really don't think this movie works for kids either), the characters are just as bad and probably worse. Bob Hoskins is a great actor, but he is a major disappointment here as Mario. He is not funny, when he intends to be funny, and he is not particularly likable. He is this colourless fellow who shows up on set to be chased away by explosions. John Leguizamo also was good in several films, but he fails to generate any interest or amusement as Luigi. As for Samantha Mathis, she is just a pretty face as Princess Daisy. Dennis Hopper is somewhat more interesting as the villain King Koopa, but he is not given that many lines or scenes to work with and the lines that he is given are usually bad. His talents, in a word, are wasted in this picture. Thus, this conclusion: there are so many things not to like about this film that the unassuming, devolved, and compassionate goombas would have stolen the show if only there was a show to steal. Frank Welker, who does the voices for these goombas, deserves credit for his performance, but sadly even his considerable talents cannot save this movie from the trash heap.
