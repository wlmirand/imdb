 <sinopse>
  After a shootout on a flight transporting prisoners, a stewardess must outwit a smooth-talking serial killer and land the plane herself.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Ryan Weaver romances beautiful women before he kills them. Ryan is arrested, convicted, and is part of a Christmas Eve transfer of prisoners on a transcontinental 747 commercial flight. Other airlines at JFK may have holiday passengers waiting on stand-by, but this jumbo jet takes off with a lot of empty seats. Ryan and another prisoner overpower and kill their guards. The few civilian passengers are herded into a "pantry" on the plane and are not seen again until the end of the movie. Ryan eliminates the other prisoners and all the crew members except Teri Halloran. The remainder of the movie follows a "cat-and-mouse" game between Ryan and Teri on the 747.

    Ray Liotta and Brendan Gleeson; i saw these names when reading the summary and thought that although it was 16 years old it could very well be a good film that i had failed to see. How wrong was i; it's terrible. The majority of the film makes you scratch your head in bewilderment at how ridiculous everything is. And as you sit scalp-less, the mundane acting makes you feel sad inside. The one and only redeeming factor of the film is Ray Liotta's psychotic persona which sometimes comes off well; sometimes. It can also be very annoying. Almost as annoying as Brendan Gleeson's massacre of an American accent. Just a very poor film; if you're considering watching it, watch something else.

    Turbulence The word "turbulence" is just fancy airline jargon for the captain is drunk. Unfortunately, the turbulence in this thriller is the result of the pilot being murdered. Accused killer Weaver (Ray Liotta) and another convict board a Boeing 747 bound for L.A. accompanied by air marshals. When the other con attacks the marshals, he inadvertently kills the pilot and copilot. Now it's up to a flight attendant, Teri (Lauren Holly), to take the controls of this hulking vessel. In addition to steering it through a deadly electrical storm, and her general lack of landing knowledge, Teri must also contend with Weaver's continuous attempts to sabotage the plane. With a laughable plot, asinine acting and numerous implausible situations, Turbulence is a trip best traveled with plenty of airsickness bags. Besides, a better escape plan for an air prisoner would be to act drunkenly belligerent until they kick you off the plane. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Turbulence is such as embarrassingly dumb movie, the actors must of surely had laughing fits in between. This is another half baked product, another one of these plane hijack movies, this bad review of it, made it made me want to go and see it. It's almost deserves it's place in the comedy section of the video store. Cool, handsome, smooth talking serial killer, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) hamming it up here, boards a plane with another bad dude, and their two escorting officers. Liotta can be scary and he definitely has his moments here. Weaver has killed a few woman, the last one nearly losing her life too, when an obsessive detective (Hector Elizondo) and his team stepped in and saved her. Liotta as you can guess, escapes as does the other prisoner and turns this plane ride into bedlam. Lauren Holly, an innocent stewardess becomes the hero of the film, as all the pilots, most of stewardess's and some passengers who should of behaved, are all deceased. All the rest of the passengers are in the top deck, Liotta and Holly are left alone, where idle chat and some too close for comfort moments, take place. At least we are learning a bit about the killer. I like that intense scene between Liotta and another stewardess, who he childs for picking on Holly, that is before he kills her in a quite gruesome way too.I think he raped her also. There's an uglyness in Turbulence, that a lot of other plane hijack movies are void of, in terms of violence, and the loss of life, that's taken away so cheaply here. For Liotta fans, Turbulence will make your night, but this film just has a lot of incredulous moments. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if the plane did a 360. Just a good laugh/action romp, that may put you off planes for good. Why Ben Cross as one of the control tower pilots, who talks Holly through a safe landing, did this, is beyond me.

    First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict. Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict. Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters. Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!! Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!

    I happen to love movies that take place on airplanes, maybe because they're usually, or always about the same thing: A terrorist (or more) hijacks the plane and threatens to kill the passengers, sometimes along with the pilot. Plus, there's a storm too, making matters worse. That's basically all you can do in an airplane movie. The only exception is "Snakes on a Plane". Anyway, I had a good time the whole way through, even though I think the film could have used more characters (and complications), and a flight attendant who is a lot more smarter. This flight attendant, played by Holly, isn't very bright, even for a victim. Maybe she should have been the one choked to death. The other stewardess, played by Hicks, is more interesting. Besides, aren't the victims killed off in horror movies usually the not-so-smart ones? I suppose I could give the movie credit for trying something a little different. *** out of ****

    This sucker was just on HBO (4am) and I read these just before watching it, which made me wanna watch it even more. Nuked some popcorn.... 1) As a pilot myself, I can tell ya a REAL aviator doesn't need to sit at the controls to instruct a rookie how to land a plane using a Navcom system. So.... they obviously didn't even take the time to chat with a pilot to begin with, nor get a technical consultant. Then she wanders off with him after, WHY: cause he 'saved' her, has an English accent or just because he's got an umbrella? Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

    Ray Liotta and Brendan Gleeson; i saw these names when reading the summary and thought that although it was 16 years old it could very well be a good film that i had failed to see. How wrong was i; it's terrible. The majority of the film makes you scratch your head in bewilderment at how ridiculous everything is. And as you sit scalp-less, the mundane acting makes you feel sad inside. The one and only redeeming factor of the film is Ray Liotta's psychotic persona which sometimes comes off well; sometimes. It can also be very annoying. Almost as annoying as Brendan Gleeson's massacre of an American accent. Just a very poor film; if you're considering watching it, watch something else.

    Turbulence The word "turbulence" is just fancy airline jargon for the captain is drunk. Unfortunately, the turbulence in this thriller is the result of the pilot being murdered. Accused killer Weaver (Ray Liotta) and another convict board a Boeing 747 bound for L.A. accompanied by air marshals. When the other con attacks the marshals, he inadvertently kills the pilot and copilot. Now it's up to a flight attendant, Teri (Lauren Holly), to take the controls of this hulking vessel. In addition to steering it through a deadly electrical storm, and her general lack of landing knowledge, Teri must also contend with Weaver's continuous attempts to sabotage the plane. With a laughable plot, asinine acting and numerous implausible situations, Turbulence is a trip best traveled with plenty of airsickness bags. Besides, a better escape plan for an air prisoner would be to act drunkenly belligerent until they kick you off the plane. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Turbulence is such as embarrassingly dumb movie, the actors must of surely had laughing fits in between. This is another half baked product, another one of these plane hijack movies, this bad review of it, made it made me want to go and see it. It's almost deserves it's place in the comedy section of the video store. Cool, handsome, smooth talking serial killer, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) hamming it up here, boards a plane with another bad dude, and their two escorting officers. Liotta can be scary and he definitely has his moments here. Weaver has killed a few woman, the last one nearly losing her life too, when an obsessive detective (Hector Elizondo) and his team stepped in and saved her. Liotta as you can guess, escapes as does the other prisoner and turns this plane ride into bedlam. Lauren Holly, an innocent stewardess becomes the hero of the film, as all the pilots, most of stewardess's and some passengers who should of behaved, are all deceased. All the rest of the passengers are in the top deck, Liotta and Holly are left alone, where idle chat and some too close for comfort moments, take place. At least we are learning a bit about the killer. I like that intense scene between Liotta and another stewardess, who he childs for picking on Holly, that is before he kills her in a quite gruesome way too.I think he raped her also. There's an uglyness in Turbulence, that a lot of other plane hijack movies are void of, in terms of violence, and the loss of life, that's taken away so cheaply here. For Liotta fans, Turbulence will make your night, but this film just has a lot of incredulous moments. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if the plane did a 360. Just a good laugh/action romp, that may put you off planes for good. Why Ben Cross as one of the control tower pilots, who talks Holly through a safe landing, did this, is beyond me.

    First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict. Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict. Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters. Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!! Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!

    I happen to love movies that take place on airplanes, maybe because they're usually, or always about the same thing: A terrorist (or more) hijacks the plane and threatens to kill the passengers, sometimes along with the pilot. Plus, there's a storm too, making matters worse. That's basically all you can do in an airplane movie. The only exception is "Snakes on a Plane". Anyway, I had a good time the whole way through, even though I think the film could have used more characters (and complications), and a flight attendant who is a lot more smarter. This flight attendant, played by Holly, isn't very bright, even for a victim. Maybe she should have been the one choked to death. The other stewardess, played by Hicks, is more interesting. Besides, aren't the victims killed off in horror movies usually the not-so-smart ones? I suppose I could give the movie credit for trying something a little different. *** out of ****

    This sucker was just on HBO (4am) and I read these just before watching it, which made me wanna watch it even more. Nuked some popcorn.... 1) As a pilot myself, I can tell ya a REAL aviator doesn't need to sit at the controls to instruct a rookie how to land a plane using a Navcom system. So.... they obviously didn't even take the time to chat with a pilot to begin with, nor get a technical consultant. Then she wanders off with him after, WHY: cause he 'saved' her, has an English accent or just because he's got an umbrella? Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her?

He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

    Ray Liotta and Brendan Gleeson; i saw these names when reading the summary and thought that although it was 16 years old it could very well be a good film that i had failed to see. How wrong was i; it's terrible. The majority of the film makes you scratch your head in bewilderment at how ridiculous everything is. And as you sit scalp-less, the mundane acting makes you feel sad inside. The one and only redeeming factor of the film is Ray Liotta's psychotic persona which sometimes comes off well; sometimes. It can also be very annoying. Almost as annoying as Brendan Gleeson's massacre of an American accent. Just a very poor film; if you're considering watching it, watch something else.

    Turbulence The word "turbulence" is just fancy airline jargon for the captain is drunk. Unfortunately, the turbulence in this thriller is the result of the pilot being murdered. Accused killer Weaver (Ray Liotta) and another convict board a Boeing 747 bound for L.A. accompanied by air marshals. When the other con attacks the marshals, he inadvertently kills the pilot and copilot. Now it's up to a flight attendant, Teri (Lauren Holly), to take the controls of this hulking vessel. In addition to steering it through a deadly electrical storm, and her general lack of landing knowledge, Teri must also contend with Weaver's continuous attempts to sabotage the plane. With a laughable plot, asinine acting and numerous implausible situations, Turbulence is a trip best traveled with plenty of airsickness bags. Besides, a better escape plan for an air prisoner would be to act drunkenly belligerent until they kick you off the plane. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Turbulence is such as embarrassingly dumb movie, the actors must of surely had laughing fits in between. This is another half baked product, another one of these plane hijack movies, this bad review of it, made it made me want to go and see it. It's almost deserves it's place in the comedy section of the video store. Cool, handsome, smooth talking serial killer, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) hamming it up here, boards a plane with another bad dude, and their two escorting officers. Liotta can be scary and he definitely has his moments here. Weaver has killed a few woman, the last one nearly losing her life too, when an obsessive detective (Hector Elizondo) and his team stepped in and saved her. Liotta as you can guess, escapes as does the other prisoner and turns this plane ride into bedlam. Lauren Holly, an innocent stewardess becomes the hero of the film, as all the pilots, most of stewardess's and some passengers who should of behaved, are all deceased. All the rest of the passengers are in the top deck, Liotta and Holly are left alone, where idle chat and some too close for comfort moments, take place. At least we are learning a bit about the killer. I like that intense scene between Liotta and another stewardess, who he childs for picking on Holly, that is before he kills her in a quite gruesome way too.I think he raped her also. There's an uglyness in Turbulence, that a lot of other plane hijack movies are void of, in terms of violence, and the loss of life, that's taken away so cheaply here. For Liotta fans, Turbulence will make your night, but this film just has a lot of incredulous moments. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if the plane did a 360. Just a good laugh/action romp, that may put you off planes for good. Why Ben Cross as one of the control tower pilots, who talks Holly through a safe landing, did this, is beyond me.

    First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict. Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict. Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters. Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!! Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!

    I happen to love movies that take place on airplanes, maybe because they're usually, or always about the same thing: A terrorist (or more) hijacks the plane and threatens to kill the passengers, sometimes along with the pilot. Plus, there's a storm too, making matters worse. That's basically all you can do in an airplane movie. The only exception is "Snakes on a Plane". Anyway, I had a good time the whole way through, even though I think the film could have used more characters (and complications), and a flight attendant who is a lot more smarter. This flight attendant, played by Holly, isn't very bright, even for a victim. Maybe she should have been the one choked to death. The other stewardess, played by Hicks, is more interesting. Besides, aren't the victims killed off in horror movies usually the not-so-smart ones? I suppose I could give the movie credit for trying something a little different. *** out of ****

    This sucker was just on HBO (4am) and I read these just before watching it, which made me wanna watch it even more. Nuked some popcorn.... 1) As a pilot myself, I can tell ya a REAL aviator doesn't need to sit at the controls to instruct a rookie how to land a plane using a Navcom system. So.... they obviously didn't even take the time to chat with a pilot to begin with, nor get a technical consultant. Then she wanders off with him after, WHY: cause he 'saved' her, has an English accent or just because he's got an umbrella? Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on.

I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

    Ray Liotta and Brendan Gleeson; i saw these names when reading the summary and thought that although it was 16 years old it could very well be a good film that i had failed to see. How wrong was i; it's terrible. The majority of the film makes you scratch your head in bewilderment at how ridiculous everything is. And as you sit scalp-less, the mundane acting makes you feel sad inside. The one and only redeeming factor of the film is Ray Liotta's psychotic persona which sometimes comes off well; sometimes. It can also be very annoying. Almost as annoying as Brendan Gleeson's massacre of an American accent. Just a very poor film; if you're considering watching it, watch something else.

    Turbulence The word "turbulence" is just fancy airline jargon for the captain is drunk. Unfortunately, the turbulence in this thriller is the result of the pilot being murdered. Accused killer Weaver (Ray Liotta) and another convict board a Boeing 747 bound for L.A. accompanied by air marshals. When the other con attacks the marshals, he inadvertently kills the pilot and copilot. Now it's up to a flight attendant, Teri (Lauren Holly), to take the controls of this hulking vessel. In addition to steering it through a deadly electrical storm, and her general lack of landing knowledge, Teri must also contend with Weaver's continuous attempts to sabotage the plane. With a laughable plot, asinine acting and numerous implausible situations, Turbulence is a trip best traveled with plenty of airsickness bags. Besides, a better escape plan for an air prisoner would be to act drunkenly belligerent until they kick you off the plane. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Turbulence is such as embarrassingly dumb movie, the actors must of surely had laughing fits in between. This is another half baked product, another one of these plane hijack movies, this bad review of it, made it made me want to go and see it. It's almost deserves it's place in the comedy section of the video store. Cool, handsome, smooth talking serial killer, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) hamming it up here, boards a plane with another bad dude, and their two escorting officers. Liotta can be scary and he definitely has his moments here. Weaver has killed a few woman, the last one nearly losing her life too, when an obsessive detective (Hector Elizondo) and his team stepped in and saved her. Liotta as you can guess, escapes as does the other prisoner and turns this plane ride into bedlam. Lauren Holly, an innocent stewardess becomes the hero of the film, as all the pilots, most of stewardess's and some passengers who should of behaved, are all deceased. All the rest of the passengers are in the top deck, Liotta and Holly are left alone, where idle chat and some too close for comfort moments, take place. At least we are learning a bit about the killer. I like that intense scene between Liotta and another stewardess, who he childs for picking on Holly, that is before he kills her in a quite gruesome way too.I think he raped her also. There's an uglyness in Turbulence, that a lot of other plane hijack movies are void of, in terms of violence, and the loss of life, that's taken away so cheaply here. For Liotta fans, Turbulence will make your night, but this film just has a lot of incredulous moments. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if the plane did a 360. Just a good laugh/action romp, that may put you off planes for good. Why Ben Cross as one of the control tower pilots, who talks Holly through a safe landing, did this, is beyond me.

    First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict. Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict. Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters. Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!! Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!

    I happen to love movies that take place on airplanes, maybe because they're usually, or always about the same thing: A terrorist (or more) hijacks the plane and threatens to kill the passengers, sometimes along with the pilot. Plus, there's a storm too, making matters worse. That's basically all you can do in an airplane movie. The only exception is "Snakes on a Plane". Anyway, I had a good time the whole way through, even though I think the film could have used more characters (and complications), and a flight attendant who is a lot more smarter. This flight attendant, played by Holly, isn't very bright, even for a victim. Maybe she should have been the one choked to death. The other stewardess, played by Hicks, is more interesting. Besides, aren't the victims killed off in horror movies usually the not-so-smart ones? I suppose I could give the movie credit for trying something a little different. *** out of ****

    This sucker was just on HBO (4am) and I read these just before watching it, which made me wanna watch it even more. Nuked some popcorn.... 1) As a pilot myself, I can tell ya a REAL aviator doesn't need to sit at the controls to instruct a rookie how to land a plane using a Navcom system. So.... they obviously didn't even take the time to chat with a pilot to begin with, nor get a technical consultant. Then she wanders off with him after, WHY: cause he 'saved' her, has an English accent or just because he's got an umbrella? Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her?

(The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.

    Ray Liotta and Brendan Gleeson; i saw these names when reading the summary and thought that although it was 16 years old it could very well be a good film that i had failed to see. How wrong was i; it's terrible. The majority of the film makes you scratch your head in bewilderment at how ridiculous everything is. And as you sit scalp-less, the mundane acting makes you feel sad inside. The one and only redeeming factor of the film is Ray Liotta's psychotic persona which sometimes comes off well; sometimes. It can also be very annoying. Almost as annoying as Brendan Gleeson's massacre of an American accent. Just a very poor film; if you're considering watching it, watch something else.

    Turbulence The word "turbulence" is just fancy airline jargon for the captain is drunk. Unfortunately, the turbulence in this thriller is the result of the pilot being murdered. Accused killer Weaver (Ray Liotta) and another convict board a Boeing 747 bound for L.A. accompanied by air marshals. When the other con attacks the marshals, he inadvertently kills the pilot and copilot. Now it's up to a flight attendant, Teri (Lauren Holly), to take the controls of this hulking vessel. In addition to steering it through a deadly electrical storm, and her general lack of landing knowledge, Teri must also contend with Weaver's continuous attempts to sabotage the plane. With a laughable plot, asinine acting and numerous implausible situations, Turbulence is a trip best traveled with plenty of airsickness bags. Besides, a better escape plan for an air prisoner would be to act drunkenly belligerent until they kick you off the plane. Red Light vidiotreviews.blogspot.ca

    Turbulence is such as embarrassingly dumb movie, the actors must of surely had laughing fits in between. This is another half baked product, another one of these plane hijack movies, this bad review of it, made it made me want to go and see it. It's almost deserves it's place in the comedy section of the video store. Cool, handsome, smooth talking serial killer, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta) hamming it up here, boards a plane with another bad dude, and their two escorting officers. Liotta can be scary and he definitely has his moments here. Weaver has killed a few woman, the last one nearly losing her life too, when an obsessive detective (Hector Elizondo) and his team stepped in and saved her. Liotta as you can guess, escapes as does the other prisoner and turns this plane ride into bedlam. Lauren Holly, an innocent stewardess becomes the hero of the film, as all the pilots, most of stewardess's and some passengers who should of behaved, are all deceased. All the rest of the passengers are in the top deck, Liotta and Holly are left alone, where idle chat and some too close for comfort moments, take place. At least we are learning a bit about the killer. I like that intense scene between Liotta and another stewardess, who he childs for picking on Holly, that is before he kills her in a quite gruesome way too.I think he raped her also. There's an uglyness in Turbulence, that a lot of other plane hijack movies are void of, in terms of violence, and the loss of life, that's taken away so cheaply here. For Liotta fans, Turbulence will make your night, but this film just has a lot of incredulous moments. I can't imagine how scared I'd be if the plane did a 360. Just a good laugh/action romp, that may put you off planes for good. Why Ben Cross as one of the control tower pilots, who talks Holly through a safe landing, did this, is beyond me.

    First: What I hate the most in action and thriller movies are helpless victims, what I want is people die while trying. This movie had evade that thing I hate, so I give this movie a very good verdict. Second: I hate movies with such special effect, that when I watch it, I already knew it is only a special effect. (Like so many movies nowadays) This movie special effect is not perfect, but it gives the "reality" needed (real people tumbling, scattered stuff went flying all over the place, vacuum sucking effect). I literally hold my breath at certain times and jaw-dropping at later times. I also give this movie special effect a very good verdict. Third: Many movies doesn't comply to logic. This movie also doesn't stray away from this situation. But let me give you some hint. Movie-Action-Fun to watch. If you want to find logic, go watch some news, documentaries, or heck, watch Dicovery Channel. This I write for those hatters. Fourth: Humans are not perfect. Those actors and actresses filled each other, where some failed (not horribly though) and some triumphed. It's a movie, for crying out loud!!! Very Good Movie, 2 thumbs up. Enough Said!

    I happen to love movies that take place on airplanes, maybe because they're usually, or always about the same thing: A terrorist (or more) hijacks the plane and threatens to kill the passengers, sometimes along with the pilot. Plus, there's a storm too, making matters worse. That's basically all you can do in an airplane movie. The only exception is "Snakes on a Plane". Anyway, I had a good time the whole way through, even though I think the film could have used more characters (and complications), and a flight attendant who is a lot more smarter. This flight attendant, played by Holly, isn't very bright, even for a victim. Maybe she should have been the one choked to death. The other stewardess, played by Hicks, is more interesting. Besides, aren't the victims killed off in horror movies usually the not-so-smart ones? I suppose I could give the movie credit for trying something a little different. *** out of ****

    This sucker was just on HBO (4am) and I read these just before watching it, which made me wanna watch it even more. Nuked some popcorn.... 1) As a pilot myself, I can tell ya a REAL aviator doesn't need to sit at the controls to instruct a rookie how to land a plane using a Navcom system. So.... they obviously didn't even take the time to chat with a pilot to begin with, nor get a technical consultant. Then she wanders off with him after, WHY: cause he 'saved' her, has an English accent or just because he's got an umbrella? Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on.

Little trampy stewardess. 2) Do they really hang all kinds of CRAP in an airplane for Xmas? With lights, and roping all lit up, causing a fire hazard? I doubt it, but I've never flown home for a holiday so don't know. That's "hard up" Xmas marketing if I've ever seen it. 3) If you intend to die and take a tight arsed/perky breasted little "it's flight attendant" blond airhead with you... wouldn't you just PLOW her chops off rather than asking all kinds of dumb Q's? The whole conversation about whether she likes sex or not is senseless: He kills a bunch of people and wants to DIE, but asks her if she LIKES SEX instead of just raping her? Ray has no credibility with me for even accepting the part. 4) On the lighter side, I did get a kick outta the killing of an "I think it's a Ford" Explorer. 5) The confused Asians in the karaoke bar: funny! They've destroyed our economy, F them! 6) Obviously, some racist broads were involved in the screen writing here: "Stewardess" is politically incorrect, but the jab at Asian Karaoke singers isn't? Buncha hypocrites! 7) The inverted flight was amusing. But... no way in HELL a plane would either get into that orientation OR right itself out of it! Well, if you can catch it on HBO or D/L it: It's a funny POS! Just as goofy as Snakes on a Plane, which actually was pretty funny!

    At one point there is an untutored bloodied flight attendant in a bra trying to fly a jumbo jet over Los Angeles during a level six (out of six) thunderstorm so she can land at LAX, while behind her a cackling maniac who has just murdered everyone else on board and wants to crash the plane into a densely populated area has just disabled the auto pilot with a mountain-climbing ax and is now hacking his way through the floor of the flight deck so he can rape and murder the flight attendant at the controls. Every moment is like this. It's as if a committee had sat around a table drinking cafe lattes until they started brainstorming on all the things that could go wrong, or could threaten to go wrong, while a couple of convicts were being transported by U. S. Marshals on an airplane. It makes one nostalgic for the 1970s when these kinds of movies were just getting started and depended on plot, character, and atmosphere a bit more. Remember "Jaws"? What this movie is like, is what "Jaws" would have been like if it had opened with a shot of "Bruce's" head surging out of the water towards the camera, mouth agape, and the remaining two hours were taken up with the shark chomping on everything in sight. We'd never get to know the sheriff or his family or any of the other characters, except in the most one-dimensional way. (The guy in the black T shirt is the sheriff. The guy with the glasses is some kind of scientist. Etc.) It wasn't so long ago that they knew how to do these things with a bit of panache, relying less on strobe lightning and electronic thunder and more on suspense. "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" is as unpretentious as this and yet is easier to watch because it's so much more interesting to know something about the people involved, something more than that they have destructible physical bodies. Going back even farther in filmic history, I'm beginning to weep with a sense of loss, going back even farther, imagine how "King Kong" would have turned out if, instead of Kong not showing up until the movie was half over, the entire movie had Kong trashing the ship's crew and then all of New York City -- during a thunderstorm. There isn't a moment's pause in "Turbulence." It snaps from crisis to crisis so quickly and with such little logic that it makes "The Taking of Pelham One Two Three" look like a masterpiece. Let me comment on the acting. I think I liked Ben Cross's part the best. He plays a British pilot in another airliner who coaches the flight attendant once in a while. His role never requires him to leave his seat. Are you down in the dumps? Are you obsessing over a lost love? Do you want your mind benumbed for about an hour and a half, so thoroughly that it takes you a while to answer the question, "What is the name of the planet you're on?" This is your movie.

    1st watched 3/1/2009  4 out of 10(Dir-Robert Butler): Good guy turned psycho hijacking a plane movie just becomes a little too all things work out right in the end for me. Sure, we're cheering for the plane to come down and the Lauren Holly character to save the day, but why wouldn't we??--- That's where the movie took us!! Manipulative movie-making at it's best here, but it doesn't make for a good movie. The story starts being about a bad cop planting evidence supposedly on a good guy.(who later turns out to be a psycho) That "good guy", played by Ray Liotta, is taken on a plane from NY to LA to go to his execution. A revolt starts up by another Psycho passenger and then we find out the Liotta character was in on it all along. Lauren Holly, plays a goody-two-shoes flight attendant who just lost her fianc&eacute;e ( so we're all rooting for her, of course) and probably wants to just get on with the rest of her life but is put in the middle of this. Who do you think becomes the hero in this whole thing?? No- it couldn't be  but it is!!(The Goody-Two-Shoes girl!!) There are some funny bits at the end of the movie while Holly is trying to land the plane, but I'm not exactly sure they were what was needed. This really is just a women's version of a guy hero movie, but not good enough for women to respect very much. It will definitely take awhile for the Lauren Holly character to date again after the incident  but she knows how to be a Hero!!(Sorry for the sarcasm in this review, I couldn't help myself)

    Sure, it's not the best movie in the world, but for action, suspense and a Lauren Holly/Ray Liotta combo, it's pretty darned good. I watched this on a lazy Saturday morning and ended up nearly hyperventilating by the time it was over, not to mention having enough excess adrenalin to turn the lazy morning into a more productive one. One viewer commented that this was the best worse movie they'd seen. I wouldn't go so far as saying it is in the 'worse' category, because it had a lot of good qualities. There was a long list of favorite character actors, enough suspense to keep you interested, great performances by Holly and Liotta (two of my favorite Soap turned Hollywood actors), one of everyone's 'worst nightmares come true', and...none of it was spoiled by a romantic element often inserted in a good heart stopper action movie. Kudos to Ms. Holly on her performance during the last fight scene. By this point, I was having to remember this was a movie, not live action. I was asking myself what I would do and how I would be feeling in a similar situation. That was the time when I realized I was hyperventilating and had to make myself take a breath. This is definitely a movie that I am glad I didn't watch just before bedtime. I would have not slept from the charge this movie gave the nervous system.

    An implausible but intense thrill ride with a more than competent cast. As the film opens, it is Christmas Eve, and we get our introduction to our Bad Guy, Ryan Weaver (Ray Liotta, doing the kind of character he does best). He's a good-looking, charming-on-the-surface killer who has come to be known as the "Lonely Hearts Strangler" because his M.O. is apparently to target a single woman, romance her for a time, and then . . . well, they do call him "Strangler". After leaving a toy store with a cute stuffed animal and arriving at his new girlfriend (next intended victim's) place, he is arrested and kicked in the stomach by the detective (Hector Elizondo) who has been after him for years and even framed him by planting evidence (although it's okay in this case because HE DONE IT! Who cares what they had to do to get him?) In a clever bit of opening misdirection, we see shots of Bad Guy on his way to his latest target's place intercut with shots of our Heroine (waifish but not anorexic, blonde-haired-big-blue-eyed Lauren Holly) in her own place in such a way as to make us think that she is his new "girlfriend", when in fact she is not. The two do meet, however, since our Heroine is a flight attendant assigned to the Christmas Eve flight on which Bad Guy is being transported to prison to await his execution. Along with Bad Guy is another con (Brendan Gleeson, in a Glee-ful performance) who's first words are his reply to our Heroine's question, "What would you like?", referring to drinks. His response? "I'd like to nail you, baby,", in the slimiest-sounding Cornpone accent you've ever heard. Is this guy really British?! Anyway, our charming con goes on to ask to be taken to the plane's bathroom, uses the soap-thingy as a weapon to kill the officer who is guarding him, and proceeds to make like Jeff Foxworthy if Foxy was a BAD-ASS Redneck. He ends up holding our Heroine hostage with a gun to her pretty blonde head, and who talks him into letting her go? None other than our Bad Guy, who at this point is still making like an unjustly accused and convicted Good Guy. In another dust-up, the other con and several others are shot. (The pilots have, in the midst of all this, been killed). Our Heroine is told by our Bad Guy that the pilot hit his head but is all right and is going to land. He begins to win her sympathy, asking her if she believes in capital punishment, to which she answers "No". Our Heroine is sharp, however, and notices that the plane does not appear to be descending. She decides to go to the cockpit herself to check things out and finds the pilot and his co-pilot dead. She manages to make contact with the ground, however, and they patch her through to a pilot (Ben Cross, who brings his presence and accent to the role)who instructs her on how to communicate with the people on the ground and how to operate the plane(to LAND it, of course). Our Bad Guy, however, is determined that they will crash and, he hopes, take as many other people with them as possible. He shows his true colors, and it is at this point that it becomes almost impossible not to enjoy watching Mr. Liotta; he simply seems to be having so much FUN playing this particular wack-pot. As the plane tosses them to-and-fro (did I mention that they're headed into a six-on-a-scale-of-one-to-six thunderstorm?) our Heroine must defend herself after being coaxed out of the cockpit by our Bad Guy. While not trying to come across as the Xena of flight attendants, Ms. Holly is determined and tough mentally and also physically when forced to fight for her life. Yes, at one point, she uses sex - or at least the promise of sex - to get our Bad Guy to let his guard down for a moment, but, hey, it's one of the few "weapons" she has at her disposal, along with the fire extinguisher she clobbers him with shortly after the bogus come-on. (Why, under these circumstances, does our psycho-but-sharp Bad Guy believe for a MOMENT that the woman he's terrorizing would have sex with him, even to save herself and the few other people on board the plane he hasn't killed? Because it's a movie, children!) Anyway, after kicking a little Bad Guy butt and ultimately getting ahold of a Marshall's gun and killing him, our Heroine manages to land the plane. Merry Christmas! If you just want to shut down your higher brain functions and watch a good psycho-killer-chiller, and especially if you like it when said chiller supposedly takes place on Christmas, this is highly recommended for you. Cheers.
