  Bogus - Meu Amigo Secreto
 </titulo>
 <rating>
  4.9
 </rating>
 <sinopse>
  Recently orphaned, a young boy is taken in by his godmother who is shocked to realize that she can see the boy's imaginary friend: a flamboyant, French magician named Bogus.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Seven year-old Albert is the son of a Las Vegas circus performer. When she is killed in a car wreck, Albert is sent to live with his mother's foster sister, Harriet Franklin, a no-nonsense businesswoman struggling in New Jersey. Albert hates it with the dour Harriet, but takes refuge in the company of Bogus, a flamboyant, gentle, loving, and altogether imaginary Frenchman. With Bogus's help, Albert can perhaps come to terms with his mother's death, and Harriet with her own loss of childhood innocence.

    I quite liked it... I had never seen anything about this movie before it came on TV. I just read that it had Whoopi Goldberg in it, and I am a fan of hers. The movie is about a little boy, named Albert who loses his mother in a car wreck. He has to go and live with his mothers foster sister (played by Whoopi) who knows absolutely nothing about children. So the kid gets an imaginary friend. The film is sad in places... i felt sorry for Albert. Haley Joel Osment played Albert... his work was not very convincing in parts of the movie. But then it is so hard to find a good child actor. I think I can name only 2 really great child actors. (Maisie Williams & Dakota Fanning) Whoopi Goldberg is a brilliant actress and she does another great job in this. I think she is one of the best actresses in America. I loved her in the Sister Act movies, Ghost, Made in America and Burglar... but my favourite film of hers is Jumpin' Jack Flash. Her character is a career driven person who does not have the time for kids. Whoopi was convincing and I felt sorry for her through the movie because she really was thrown in the deep end really by having this boy dumped in her lap. Gerard Depardieu plays the imaginary friend named Bogus. He also did a good job. He was funny in places and really believable that he cares. I don't really have anything bad to say about this movie, except maybe Haley wasn't very good at certain points. The story was good. It made me smile and made me feel sad in places. A good movie... I will give this 7 out of 10. I hope to see Whoopi back in a blockbuster where she belongs very soon.

    This is a very moving film about loss and triumph ; the question all the way is how much is the child's imagination and how much is real. Haley Joel Osment plays bereavement well for one so young.Gerard Depardieu and Whoopie Goldberg are beautifully played and again we are left to wonder as to how much is actually happening. The story unfolds to portray the growing trust between the child and his guardian as they both battle their berevement and the child coping in a new city. It may seem an unlikely topic for a film and at times slightly surreal but the ending left me feeling very moved and somehow ...hopeful.

    There have been critics that dismiss Bogus as overly-sentimental cods wallop, but after seeing it for myself I actually disagree. While sometimes univolving in terms of story, this fantasy film about a young lonely orphaned boy befriending a seemingly-imaginary man never fails to be pleasant and charming. It is beautifully filmed, with lush cinematography and lovely scenery. And I liked the music as well. The direction is pretty solid, and there are some very poignant moments. The performances are not at all bad, Haley Joel Osment undoubtedly gives the strongest one of the lot, while looking extremely cute he does convince in the delivery of his lines and in his face. Gerard Depardieu gives a very pleasant and whimsical characterisation as the imaginary friend, however if his character was perhaps more complex he would've been more memorable. Whoopi Goldberg gives her usual standard of performance, a woman with attitude, yet with a soft side to her, and that is exactly what her character Harriet is like. However, the film while nicely performed and meaning well, is weighed down by an uninvolving story and a sometimes weak script. And there are some problems with the pace, I found the middle half rather slow for my liking. All in all, undemanding but pleasant and charming, and in some ways misunderstood too. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    I had never heard of this bizarre film before it turned up on TV last night. When I say bizarre, this isn't because of the story, which is interesting and unusual, nor because of the performances which are mostly fine: Osment, as a very young boy, is as good as he subsequently proved himself to be, Depardieu has a lot of fun, and the supports are all fine. Only Whoopi Goldberg finds herself at the disadvantage of a character which requires her to be singlemindedly unsympathetic until a sudden (and, frankly, unconvincing) epiphany near the end). The casting leans towards the bizarre, the point where Goldberg starts to be able to see Osment's imaginary friend is implausible enough to up the bizarreness quotient noticeably, and the full-on Fred and Ginger dance routine delivered by Goldberg and Depardieu, while very nearly worth the admission price in its own right, is (let's be honest here) full-throttle bizarreness made flesh. An interesting experiment - not wholly successful, but with enough good points to make it worth a watch.

    In his graceful overgrown sheepdog sort of way Gerard Depardieu good - naturedly has this movie in his hip pocket.He grins wryly,shrugs in the Gallic manner and mugs his way happily through what could have been a syruppy saccharine part as Albert's imaginary friend come to life to help him deal with the death of his beloved circus performer mother. Farmed out to Whoopi Goldberg - a reluctant stepmother if there ever was one - Albert (young Master Osment) is a rebel without a pause until Bogus shows him the common ground he and Miss Goldberg can inhabit. I would normally walk a mile over broken glass in my bare feet to avoid movies about cute kids and their imaginary pals,but "Bogus" never quite takes itself seriously.Just when you fear it might turn into a blubfest there is a change of mood and we're off to the races,as it were,with Gerard and Whoopi in the saddle. The soundtrack is marvellous,Depardieu and La Goldberg have a lot of fun with some energetic dance routines and the movie is an all-round happy experience.A wonderful alternative to watching the FTSE and Dow Jones drop to an all - time low whilst waiting in vain for the first banker to jump out of a window.

    Doing for orphaned children what Ghost did for grieving lovers, Bogus is a sweet-natured fantasy that's sure to have some viewers reaching for a Kleenex. With The Sixth Sense still three years in his future, Haley Joel Osment plays 7-year-old Albert, whose happy life is disrupted when his mother (Nancy Travis) is killed in a traffic accident. Her will stipulates that Albert be placed in the custody of his mom's little-known half-sister, Harriet (Whoopi Goldberg), a New Jersey restaurant-supply owner who's anything but motherly. That's when Albert invents Bogus (Gerard Depardieu), an imaginary friend who springs to life from a coloring book drawing--clearly the product of Albert's need for love and companionship. It's easy to see why director Norman Jewison was drawn to the challenge of this delicate, charmingly cast fantasy/drama whimsically written by Alvin Sargent (Oscar&reg;-winner for Ordinary People), and there are some lovely moments that capture a fleeting sense of wonder. But like the similar fantasy Three Wishes, the magic is lightweight and it doesn't always work. Your best bet is to just surrender to the sentiment, and don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two.

    Let's talk child actors. There have been many over the last century, Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple are possibly the best known and most successful. Others like McCauley Culkin were in the right place at the right time and couldn't make the transition to adult movies. I put Haley Joel Osment right up near the top of the tree. He went on to be brilliant in Sixth sense & extremely good in A.I. He is also the best thing about this movie. He has a wonderful ability to act with his eyes, this makes his performances so much more credible. This movie has some humorous moments, but is actually rather sad & full of people searching but not finding their goal. Whoopi Goldberg didn't really add a dimension to performances we've seen dozens of times from her and Gerard Depardieu was OK but unspectacular. There's definitely a message in this movie and the whole topic of imaginary friends is a fascinating topic to explore. I'm not sure that this movie managed to hit the mark, mainly due to the disruptive and slightly confusing on occasions use of flashbacks & fantasy.

    Gerald Depardieu at his most average is better than many other actors at their very best. Well this isn't necessarily true. However as an actor, Depardieu has attempted everything, not all of them good but what he always manages to convey on the screen is a presence that is strong and full of conviction, no matter what the circumstances, as a viewer this is hard to fault. In the movie Bogus we see one of these performances. What we should also mention is fine support from Whoopi Goldberg and a sublime Haley Joel Osment. Bogus is an interesting, well acted and well crafted, fantasy piece, it is a story about the mind of a child and how this can cross over into a real/adult world. This is a movie that could have easily missed it's intended mark with lesser actors, and a less experienced director. But through imagination, depth of characters and a special bond between the three actors, this movie succeeds.

    Whoopi Goldberg has always been one of my favorite actresses, but in this film, we really get to see her angry miserable side which she plays so well, not to say she was horrible, but i really wanted to see that big whoopi grin, but i guess it wasn't in her characters makeup. The story was ok, the ending was not as i would have imagined, which i thought would be the falling in love, so the little boy could have a mother and father who loved him and lived happy ever after, and moved to Las Vegas. All the boy wanted, when his mother died, was to carry on her dream, and become a circus magician, but that didn't come to be, hardly a happy ending then. It's an ok movie, with a few really funny lines.

    "Bogus" is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Whoopi Goldberg once again proves to be one of the poorest actresses of our time. The dialogue between her and Gerard Depardieu (who also can't act) attempts to be witty and funny, but it just sounds like contrived garbage. Please do yourself a favor and avoid the movie "Bogus". Luckily, I'm sure that most people did, otherwise I'd hear more complaining about what a horrible movie it is.

    This is a very moving film about loss and triumph ; the question all the way is how much is the child's imagination and how much is real. Haley Joel Osment plays bereavement well for one so young.Gerard Depardieu and Whoopie Goldberg are beautifully played and again we are left to wonder as to how much is actually happening. The story unfolds to portray the growing trust between the child and his guardian as they both battle their berevement and the child coping in a new city. It may seem an unlikely topic for a film and at times slightly surreal but the ending left me feeling very moved and somehow ...hopeful.

    There have been critics that dismiss Bogus as overly-sentimental cods wallop, but after seeing it for myself I actually disagree. While sometimes univolving in terms of story, this fantasy film about a young lonely orphaned boy befriending a seemingly-imaginary man never fails to be pleasant and charming. It is beautifully filmed, with lush cinematography and lovely scenery. And I liked the music as well. The direction is pretty solid, and there are some very poignant moments. The performances are not at all bad, Haley Joel Osment undoubtedly gives the strongest one of the lot, while looking extremely cute he does convince in the delivery of his lines and in his face. Gerard Depardieu gives a very pleasant and whimsical characterisation as the imaginary friend, however if his character was perhaps more complex he would've been more memorable. Whoopi Goldberg gives her usual standard of performance, a woman with attitude, yet with a soft side to her, and that is exactly what her character Harriet is like. However, the film while nicely performed and meaning well, is weighed down by an uninvolving story and a sometimes weak script. And there are some problems with the pace, I found the middle half rather slow for my liking. All in all, undemanding but pleasant and charming, and in some ways misunderstood too. 7/10 Bethany Cox

    I had never heard of this bizarre film before it turned up on TV last night. When I say bizarre, this isn't because of the story, which is interesting and unusual, nor because of the performances which are mostly fine: Osment, as a very young boy, is as good as he subsequently proved himself to be, Depardieu has a lot of fun, and the supports are all fine. Only Whoopi Goldberg finds herself at the disadvantage of a character which requires her to be singlemindedly unsympathetic until a sudden (and, frankly, unconvincing) epiphany near the end). The casting leans towards the bizarre, the point where Goldberg starts to be able to see Osment's imaginary friend is implausible enough to up the bizarreness quotient noticeably, and the full-on Fred and Ginger dance routine delivered by Goldberg and Depardieu, while very nearly worth the admission price in its own right, is (let's be honest here) full-throttle bizarreness made flesh. An interesting experiment - not wholly successful, but with enough good points to make it worth a watch.

    In his graceful overgrown sheepdog sort of way Gerard Depardieu good - naturedly has this movie in his hip pocket.He grins wryly,shrugs in the Gallic manner and mugs his way happily through what could have been a syruppy saccharine part as Albert's imaginary friend come to life to help him deal with the death of his beloved circus performer mother. Farmed out to Whoopi Goldberg - a reluctant stepmother if there ever was one - Albert (young Master Osment) is a rebel without a pause until Bogus shows him the common ground he and Miss Goldberg can inhabit. I would normally walk a mile over broken glass in my bare feet to avoid movies about cute kids and their imaginary pals,but "Bogus" never quite takes itself seriously.Just when you fear it might turn into a blubfest there is a change of mood and we're off to the races,as it were,with Gerard and Whoopi in the saddle. The soundtrack is marvellous,Depardieu and La Goldberg have a lot of fun with some energetic dance routines and the movie is an all-round happy experience.A wonderful alternative to watching the FTSE and Dow Jones drop to an all - time low whilst waiting in vain for the first banker to jump out of a window.

    Doing for orphaned children what Ghost did for grieving lovers, Bogus is a sweet-natured fantasy that's sure to have some viewers reaching for a Kleenex. With The Sixth Sense still three years in his future, Haley Joel Osment plays 7-year-old Albert, whose happy life is disrupted when his mother (Nancy Travis) is killed in a traffic accident. Her will stipulates that Albert be placed in the custody of his mom's little-known half-sister, Harriet (Whoopi Goldberg), a New Jersey restaurant-supply owner who's anything but motherly. That's when Albert invents Bogus (Gerard Depardieu), an imaginary friend who springs to life from a coloring book drawing--clearly the product of Albert's need for love and companionship. It's easy to see why director Norman Jewison was drawn to the challenge of this delicate, charmingly cast fantasy/drama whimsically written by Alvin Sargent (Oscar&reg;-winner for Ordinary People), and there are some lovely moments that capture a fleeting sense of wonder. But like the similar fantasy Three Wishes, the magic is lightweight and it doesn't always work. Your best bet is to just surrender to the sentiment, and don't be surprised if you shed a tear or two.

    Let's talk child actors. There have been many over the last century, Mickey Rooney, Shirley Temple are possibly the best known and most successful. Others like McCauley Culkin were in the right place at the right time and couldn't make the transition to adult movies. I put Haley Joel Osment right up near the top of the tree. He went on to be brilliant in Sixth sense & extremely good in A.I. He is also the best thing about this movie. He has a wonderful ability to act with his eyes, this makes his performances so much more credible. This movie has some humorous moments, but is actually rather sad & full of people searching but not finding their goal. Whoopi Goldberg didn't really add a dimension to performances we've seen dozens of times from her and Gerard Depardieu was OK but unspectacular. There's definitely a message in this movie and the whole topic of imaginary friends is a fascinating topic to explore. I'm not sure that this movie managed to hit the mark, mainly due to the disruptive and slightly confusing on occasions use of flashbacks & fantasy.

    Gerald Depardieu at his most average is better than many other actors at their very best. Well this isn't necessarily true. However as an actor, Depardieu has attempted everything, not all of them good but what he always manages to convey on the screen is a presence that is strong and full of conviction, no matter what the circumstances, as a viewer this is hard to fault. In the movie Bogus we see one of these performances. What we should also mention is fine support from Whoopi Goldberg and a sublime Haley Joel Osment. Bogus is an interesting, well acted and well crafted, fantasy piece, it is a story about the mind of a child and how this can cross over into a real/adult world. This is a movie that could have easily missed it's intended mark with lesser actors, and a less experienced director. But through imagination, depth of characters and a special bond between the three actors, this movie succeeds.

    Whoopi Goldberg has always been one of my favorite actresses, but in this film, we really get to see her angry miserable side which she plays so well, not to say she was horrible, but i really wanted to see that big whoopi grin, but i guess it wasn't in her characters makeup. The story was ok, the ending was not as i would have imagined, which i thought would be the falling in love, so the little boy could have a mother and father who loved him and lived happy ever after, and moved to Las Vegas. All the boy wanted, when his mother died, was to carry on her dream, and become a circus magician, but that didn't come to be, hardly a happy ending then. It's an ok movie, with a few really funny lines.

    "Bogus" is seriously one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Whoopi Goldberg once again proves to be one of the poorest actresses of our time. The dialogue between her and Gerard Depardieu (who also can't act) attempts to be witty and funny, but it just sounds like contrived garbage. Please do yourself a favor and avoid the movie "Bogus". Luckily, I'm sure that most people did, otherwise I'd hear more complaining about what a horrible movie it is.
