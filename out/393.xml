 <sinopse>
  After a bitter divorce, an actor disguises himself as a female housekeeper to spend time with his children held in custody by his former wife.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Daniel Hillard is an eccentric actor who specializes in dubbing voices for cartoon characters. Daniel is a kind man and a loving father to his three kids Lydia, Chris, and Natalie, but Daniel's wife Miranda sees him as a poor disciplinarian, and a bad role model. After Daniel throws an elaborate and disastrous birthday party for Chris, Miranda reaches the end of her limited patience, and files for a divorce. Daniel is heartbroken when Miranda is given custody of the kids and he's only allowed to visit them once a week. Determined to stay in contact with his kids, Daniel discovers that Miranda is looking for a housekeeper, and with help from his brother Frank, a makeup artist, Daniel gets the job, disguised as Mrs. Iphegenia Doubtfire, a Scottish nanny. Daniel pulls off the ruse so well that neither Miranda nor his children recognize him, and in the process, he learns some parenting tips. Daniel also has to deal with Miranda's new boyfriend, a jerk named Stu Dunmeyer.

    I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of "Mrs. Doubtfire", an older, British woman. The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as "Mrs. Doubtfire" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both "Mrs. Doubtfire" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise. This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

    I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie. Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie. The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one. Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie. Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well. Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character. Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO? If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock

    Improv master that Robin Williams is,put him in a dress pretending to be a woman and you open up a lot of doors.His improv abilities alone make for an entertaining hour or more,but you put him in a dress and you also open up the ole slapstick door.Take a well written story and add it to all of that and you have a very decent comedy picture.Tender dramatic moments are also added in just the right places to make it even better.Man dressed a female comedy films are a dime a dozen,but this film is among the best executions of the idea,if not the best period.Great support given by Sally Field who has proved more than once that she can be funny in her own right.

    I haven't seen this movie since I was a child and let me tell ya it had to be one of the most hilarious movies of the 1990s. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious. And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

    Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily. Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful. A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of "drag" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10

    It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything that time. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundreds time now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.

    This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.

    Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire.Although,Daniel is obviously a crazy character,what hes doing seems alright,because hes doing it just to be with his children,which is very sweet. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.

    I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of "Mrs. Doubtfire", an older, British woman. The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as "Mrs. Doubtfire" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both "Mrs. Doubtfire" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise. This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

    I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie. Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie. The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one. Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie. Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well. Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character. Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO? If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock

    Improv master that Robin Williams is,put him in a dress pretending to be a woman and you open up a lot of doors.His improv abilities alone make for an entertaining hour or more,but you put him in a dress and you also open up the ole slapstick door.Take a well written story and add it to all of that and you have a very decent comedy picture.Tender dramatic moments are also added in just the right places to make it even better.Man dressed a female comedy films are a dime a dozen,but this film is among the best executions of the idea,if not the best period.Great support given by Sally Field who has proved more than once that she can be funny in her own right.

    I haven't seen this movie since I was a child and let me tell ya it had to be one of the most hilarious movies of the 1990s. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious. And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

    Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily. Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful. A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of "drag" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10

    It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything that time. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundreds time now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.

    This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.

    Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire.Although,Daniel is obviously a crazy character,what hes doing seems alright,because hes doing it just to be with his children,which is very sweet. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.

Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie. The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one. Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie. Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well. Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character. Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO? If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock

    Improv master that Robin Williams is,put him in a dress pretending to be a woman and you open up a lot of doors.His improv abilities alone make for an entertaining hour or more,but you put him in a dress and you also open up the ole slapstick door.Take a well written story and add it to all of that and you have a very decent comedy picture.Tender dramatic moments are also added in just the right places to make it even better.Man dressed a female comedy films are a dime a dozen,but this film is among the best executions of the idea,if not the best period.Great support given by Sally Field who has proved more than once that she can be funny in her own right.

    I haven't seen this movie since I was a child and let me tell ya it had to be one of the most hilarious movies of the 1990s. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious. And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

    Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily. Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful. A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of "drag" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10

    It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything that time. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundreds time now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.

    This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.

    Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire.Although,Daniel is obviously a crazy character,what hes doing seems alright,because hes doing it just to be with his children,which is very sweet. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.

    I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of "Mrs. Doubtfire", an older, British woman. The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as "Mrs. Doubtfire" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both "Mrs. Doubtfire" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise. This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

    Improv master that Robin Williams is,put him in a dress pretending to be a woman and you open up a lot of doors.His improv abilities alone make for an entertaining hour or more,but you put him in a dress and you also open up the ole slapstick door.Take a well written story and add it to all of that and you have a very decent comedy picture.Tender dramatic moments are also added in just the right places to make it even better.Man dressed a female comedy films are a dime a dozen,but this film is among the best executions of the idea,if not the best period.Great support given by Sally Field who has proved more than once that she can be funny in her own right.

    I haven't seen this movie since I was a child and let me tell ya it had to be one of the most hilarious movies of the 1990s. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious. And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

    Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily. Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful. A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of "drag" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10

    It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything that time. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundreds time now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.

It all starts with a man by the name of Daniel Hillard. He and his wife, Miranda, were blessed with three wonderful children, like all of you. But their parents didn't get along, dears, and they had to separate It was a very sad day for everyone.

    This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.

    Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire.Although,Daniel is obviously a crazy character,what hes doing seems alright,because hes doing it just to be with his children,which is very sweet. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.

    I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of "Mrs. Doubtfire", an older, British woman. The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as "Mrs. Doubtfire" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both "Mrs. Doubtfire" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise. This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

    I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie. Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie. The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one. Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie. Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well. Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character. Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO? If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock

And now to the bad I absolutely hated seeing the part where Robin Williams would switch from Daniel to Mrs Doubtfire every now and again and seeing him rip off the mask off his face,I got kinda disgusted cause that sorta creeps me out as its so real looking and you think he was ripping the skin off his face,but in saying that I really enjoyed this film and if you haven't seen it then check it out.

    Mrs. Doubtfire is directed by Chris Columbus and adapted to screenplay by Randi Mayem Singer and Leslie Dixon from the novel Alias Madame Doubtfire written by Anne Fine. It stars Robin Williams, Sally Field, Lisa Jakub, Matthew Lawrence, Mara Wilson, Pierce Brosnan and Harvey Fierstein. Music is by Howard Shore and cinematography by Donald McAlpine. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard, a struggling out of work actor who when faced with divorce from Miranda (Field) and separation from his three children, disguises himself as an old female housekeeper in order to see them daily. Centrally as a film it is what it is, a chance for Williams (excellent) to dress up in drag and act the goof, but boy does he do it well. In the mix is the serious aspects involving the pain of imminent divorce and separation from one's children. The script is sharp and ready made for Williams' brand of cynical witticisms, while not painting Brosnan's Stuart Dunmire (the new man in Miranda's life) as an oily snake shows good sense in the writing. The child actors are engaging and never sickly, while Fierstein as Daniel's artistic eccentric brother is gloriously colourful. A real family crowd pleaser that turned a profit of over $400 million at the worldwide box office, it's not a film that pushes boundaries of "drag" comedy, and you don't have to dig too far for flaws. But this is often very funny and it hits the right emotional beats for the topic at hand. 8/10

    It was my first movie that I ever watched with my dad. First English movie I guess. I was so little then. couldn't even understood everything that time. but there are some movies you can watch and still enjoy it. I watched it like hundreds time now. Still it doesn't get boring at all. I will never forget the memory of it. Specially the memory of watching this movie with my dad. Also it gives the children a lesson that no matter what happens, parents stays together or not they will always loves us. Excellent family movie to watch. People can come closer seeing the movie. Its sad that people think that it isn't worth of rate ten.

It all starts with a man by the name of Daniel Hillard. He and his wife, Miranda, were blessed with three wonderful children, like all of you. But their parents didn't get along, dears, and they had to separate It was a very sad day for everyone.

    This is a great film, and overlooked from the standpoint of being about a man's struggle to avoid living their rat race lifestyle that so many of them live in, while measuring up enough to get to see his kids! The acting is brilliantly superb on every level and character: Robin Williams, of course, but also Sally Fields is the character of his career oriented wife, Pierce Bronsan as the character of the career guy who wants to take her away from her family. The kids are just darling also. This film is sweet natured, charming and warm as is Williams' portrayal of the portly Mrs. Doubtfire. When I very first saw this outside of the movie theatre and on DVD, I watched it three times straight, and saw something a little different about the struggles that contemporary modern men have to go through to balance their male macho and soft sensitive sides that is part of their natures.

    Mrs Doubtfire is a great movie with a heartwarming and hilarious story line,a great cast and some very funny scenes that will have the whole family laughing,mostly because Robin Williams is hilarious,and brilliant at impressions,and gives a terrific and believable performance as the pretend nanny Mrs Euphegenia Doubtfire.Although,Daniel is obviously a crazy character,what hes doing seems alright,because hes doing it just to be with his children,which is very sweet. Daniel Hillard (Robin Williams) is recently divorced from Miranda (Sally Field),who wont allow him see his children,so he disguises as a nanny,Mrs Doubtfire,in order to spend time with them while Mirandas working.

    I am not the biggest fan of Robin Williams, but I love these family kinds of movies that he makes! I have loved watching this movie since I was a kid. It has great comedy, and both Robin Williams and Sally Fields are excellent in their roles. ****SPOILERS AHEAD***** In San Francisco, a married couple have problems. The fun actor and comedian father (Robin Williams) has no sense of discipline when it comes to his three kids, and is not able to keep a job. His career-oriented wife (Sally Fields) is left bitter and upset since she has to continually pick up the pieces (literally) from what her childish husband does, and no longer sees anything comical about her husband's behaviors. After yet another episode of her husband's irresponsibility (in which she comes home to find a petting zoo in their yard and their house in shambles), she informs him that she wants a divorce. The movie then goes on to show the struggle that this father goes through in order to put his life in order while struggling to find and keep a job that he enjoys, while also trying to keep partial custody of his children. He finds this balance by using his acting ability, along with a disguise(with the help of his brother), to be hired by his ex-wife as the nanny of his own children under the guise of "Mrs. Doubtfire", an older, British woman. The hilarity continues throughout the entire movie as "Mrs. Doubtfire" has to deal with the jealousy of his ex-wife's new love interest (played by Pierce Brosnan) and trying to reconnect with his children as both "Mrs. Doubtfire" and as their father, all while trying to maintain his disguise. This movie is very fun, though there is some language and scenarios that are not meant for young children. Overall, a very fun movie that is also heartwarming!

    I used to have a huge grudge against Mrs. Doubtfire. Yes. I did. And all because of a Mrs. Tootsie. Granted they're not entirely the same movieOut of work straight actor, dresses as a woman to get a new career and to impress the girl he likes. Both are comedies, have heart, are both hilarious and touching and had to do with the lead actor working on television. Wait Damn. They pretty much are the same movie. The reason I had a thing against Mrs. D is that I was so in love with the movie Tootsie  and still am, and more people forgot all about that movie in lieu of this one. Butafter purchasing this on BluRay and rewatching for the (probably) 13th time, I really, REALLY enjoyed this feature. Perhaps one day we can all live in a world where we can appreciate both? Well, maybe just this one since  ah-HEM  Tootsie is yet to be available on BluRay. Great, now I am back to hating on this movie. Joke. And speaking of which, this movie, though extremely formulaic, is a riot. Thanks to the perfect timing and lines from Robin Williams. When he's wacky he's hilarious. When he had low humor, it's deep and still uproarious. And when he's serious, he shows a ton of heart. Secondary characters, Sally Fields, Pierce Brosnan, Polly Holliday and Harvey Fierstein also played their roles great and often funny. Even they kids played their roles fairly well. Man both loses his job and wife fairly quickly and must learn to deal with the time away from his kids, a new life including rent and job and the fact that the only way to see his kids is to dress as an English maid, a la the title character. Really, overall, the movie's extremely harmless and an enormous amount of fun and heart, but there was that nagging feeling I got about how, even in 1993, un-accepting everyone was, including the children, of a man dressing up as a woman in..SAN FRANCISCO? If you can suspend your disbelief for that, you'll have a great time. Well, at least, until Tootsie is finally available on BluRay. Tick-tock, tick-tock

    Improv master that Robin Williams is,put him in a dress pretending to be a woman and you open up a lot of doors.His improv abilities alone make for an entertaining hour or more,but you put him in a dress and you also open up the ole slapstick door.Take a well written story and add it to all of that and you have a very decent comedy picture.Tender dramatic moments are also added in just the right places to make it even better.Man dressed a female comedy films are a dime a dozen,but this film is among the best executions of the idea,if not the best period.Great support given by Sally Field who has proved more than once that she can be funny in her own right.

    I haven't seen this movie since I was a child and let me tell ya it had to be one of the most hilarious movies of the 1990s. Robin Williams plays Daniel Hillard a voice over actor who got fired from his job and is set for a bitter divorce from his wife Miranda played by The Amazing Spiderman star Sally Field who has had it with him and she wants full custody of their children,so Daniel comes up with a great plan to see his kids more often by you guess it disguise himself as an old Scottish woman called Mrs Doubtfire thanks to his best friend who is a Special Effects Make Up Artist. The disguise is so good no one knows that its him behind the prosthetic mask that he wears along with the white wig and the body suit and frock. But problems arise when he finds out that his ex wife has met someone else who goes by the name Stu played by former James Bond star Pierce Brosnan. So what do I like and not like about this movie,well first what I liked about it was the acting and the humor which was brilliant,no matter what film Robin Williams is in he always makes me laugh,another thing I liked was the story because Robin's charcther was desperate to see his kids again and his wife was such a bitch to him he demanded to see them more. Also what I like about this film is the Special Make Up Effects that is done by Greg Gammon who also did the Special Make Up Effects for the 1994 film The Mask,I swear when Robin Williams was dressed up as that Scottish nanny I was shocked at it I was like saying to myself who plays that old lady that looks like Robin William's grandmother or whatever and then when he rips off the mask from his face I was like WHAT that's a dude in drag hilarious.
