  A manipulative Southern belle carries on a turbulent affair with a blockade runner during the American Civil War.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Scarlett is a woman who can deal with a nation at war, Atlanta burning, the Union Army carrying off everything from her beloved Tara, the carpetbaggers who arrive after the war. Scarlett is beautiful. She has vitality. But Ashley, the man she has wanted for so long, is going to marry his placid cousin, Melanie. Mammy warns Scarlett to behave herself at the party at Twelve Oaks. There is a new man there that day, the day the Civil War begins. Rhett Butler. Scarlett does not know he is in the room when she pleads with Ashley to choose her instead of Melanie.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

    Scarlett wants Ashley, Ashley loves Melanie, Scarlett meets Rhett, Rhett wants Scarlett. Melanie dies. Scarlett tells Ashley he can have her. Ashley tells Scarlett he doesn't want her. Scarlett realizes she actually loves Rhett, but Rhett doesn't love her anymore and leaves. How cheesy can you get ? To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

    Scarlett wants Ashley, Ashley loves Melanie, Scarlett meets Rhett, Rhett wants Scarlett. Melanie dies. Scarlett tells Ashley he can have her. Ashley tells Scarlett he doesn't want her. Scarlett realizes she actually loves Rhett, but Rhett doesn't love her anymore and leaves. How cheesy can you get ? To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

Scarlett realizes she actually loves Rhett, but Rhett doesn't love her anymore and leaves. How cheesy can you get ? To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

    Scarlett wants Ashley, Ashley loves Melanie, Scarlett meets Rhett, Rhett wants Scarlett. Melanie dies. Scarlett tells Ashley he can have her. Ashley tells Scarlett he doesn't want her. Scarlett realizes she actually loves Rhett, but Rhett doesn't love her anymore and leaves. How cheesy can you get ? To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late.

The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing

    Scarlett wants Ashley, Ashley loves Melanie, Scarlett meets Rhett, Rhett wants Scarlett. Melanie dies. Scarlett tells Ashley he can have her. Ashley tells Scarlett he doesn't want her. Scarlett realizes she actually loves Rhett, but Rhett doesn't love her anymore and leaves. How cheesy can you get ? To fill out this stupid story, we add a colorful backdrop of the civil war and paint a romantic Picture of the old south. The problem is that to make a story interesting, You need to be able to feel some sympathy for the main character, but unfortunately Scarlett has absolutely no redeeming qualities. She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

She's spoiled, self centered and completely not interesting as a person. As to the movie itself i suppose it lives up to Hollywood standards technically. There wasn't really much they could do with the story, but visual quality aside, sitting through 4 hours of this romantic rubbish is pure torture.

    "Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn." One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride. They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance. Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable. The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me.

    I enjoyed the movie Gone with Wind. I liked the costumes and the scenery, I felt it gave a very thorough look at the South during the Civil war. The struggles and the days of the war were very realistic. I liked when Scarlet said "I will never go hungry again" It showed the strength of a real southern family. Being one of the first color films in history, it was really something to see. Although I am old enough to have seen the film in a theater at the time, I don't recall that. I did see it at an elder hostel and learned much about the era and the making of the movie. I also remember watching it through the years with my family back on Long Island in the 1970's on the Million Dollar Movie on a local channel. I now have the pleasure of watching it with my grandson who is a very big movie fan and will most likely be working in the film industry when he grows up. Movies like Gone with the Wind are great for families and great for learning history.

    1939 is considered to be the peak of the Hollywood Studio System and GWTW is the Pike's Peak of Hollywood's output to that point. This is one of the longest, highly regarded Films, at nearly 4 Hours. It is more embraced by Women than Men and attacked more by Liberals than Conservatives for its sentimentalizing the Lifestyle that was gone with the wind after the War. A Soap Opera of gargantuan status, this overlong, overrated, tear-jerker is at times mesmerizing but manipulative. This is the stuff of Romance Novel Tomes that are more emotional than engaging with scatterbrained Females using their wily wares to get what they want in supremely selfish ways with little or no regard for anyone. In this the Movie succeeds in spades. The Civil War is presented battle less but not without suffering, much suffering. There are a few magnificent shots with "great balls of fire", and an unforgettable Scene that begins with Scarlett entering the Street from the Hospital and as the Camera pulls back from Her, it is one of the most famous Establishing Shots in Cinema History ending with a tattered Confederate Flag. In short (absolutely impossible) this is an Ethnocentric and ever popular (although it has lost some of its support and is declining in affection over the Years), slanted, with its unapologetic Politics and Historical Whitewashing, Artifact of an age of Movie Making that is gone but not forgotten.

    Here's the scoop about GWTW: Two hours of brilliance, 30 minutes of soapy melodrama, and two great final lines to wrap it up. *****S P O I L E R S***** The movie is great until Scarlet and Rhett get married. After that it devolves into the tale of two petulant, hard-headed people who never seem to be in love at the same time. Rhett is deeply in love and happy after Bonnie Blue is born, but Scarlett seems jealous of his affection for their daughter and promptly destroys their happiness by kicking Rhett out of her bed. She survives public embarrassment at Ashley's birthday party, thanks to Melanie's saintly temperament. Rhett basically rapes her in a drunken rage (after dramatically carrying her up the stairs), but Scarlet awakes the next morning blissfully happy. Must have been good sex. Well, apparently not for Rhett, who apologizes and asks for a divorce. Huh? He whisks Bonnie off to London, then returns to discover Scarlet is pregnant, so he promptly berates her and indirectly causes her to fall down the stairs, losing the baby. She calls for him on her sick bed. He declares his love for her. Problem is neither knows of the other's feelings. Rhett wants to try again, but it's Scarlet's turn to act selfish. Then Bonnie dies, which makes them both go crazy. Then Melanie dies. Scarlet finally figures out that Ashley doesn't love her, but it's too late to save her marriage. Then they each get their famous final lines: "Frankly my dear, I don't give a dam." "Tomorrow is another day." The music swells. The end. A great ending, but during the previous 30 minutes we are forced to deal with two rather unlikable people. What happened to the charmingly roguish cavalier and the prissy southern belle-turned-strong-businesswoman we saw in the first 2/3 of the film? Neither character is perfect, but the ugly, childish turns they take after they marry make that stretch of film almost unwatchable. With a little more editing and re-writing, GWTW could have been perfect. As it is, it's still very good.

    Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex. Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not. The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done. This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally "got" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film.

    "Received 10 Oscars ...", which is a record. But I do not think it would become clear only by watching the movie. Quite stretched in time, the film shows us the relationship between the people involved in the war. "An entire civilization gone with the wind." How strange, this quote from the beginning of the film reminded me of the relationship between people over the last twenty years in our dear country. Instead of a love triangle, gone with the wind offer us love quadrangle, brilliantly garnished with lots of hypocrisy, greed, insensitivity and false success. At least true goodness preserve the honor for which is so much talked throughout the film. Realistic was the finale where the heroine has come to the truth about herself - that was truly loved, but she did not respond to those feelings and now it's too late. Here, the land, the house turned out to be a panacea for love, which does not seem to me very chaste. Of all these stories, I mean "Wuthering Heights," "Pride and Prejudice", "War and Peace", "The Brothers Karamazov" and others, "Gone with the Wind" were really so windy that you have to wonder what exactly it is telling about.

    Gone With the Wind. A movie that has stood the test of time to prove that there are still people out there, normally perfectly reasonable people, that believe that a disgusting, repulsive, and manipulative woman such as our protagonist is a "model of feminism". Throughout this Civil War epic, we are treated to a glimpse into the life of "Southern Belle" Miss Scarlett O'Hara. A four hour glimpse, but a glimpse, nonetheless. Throughout this tale of love and passion, we watch our leading lady, played magnificently by Vivien Leigh, lust after a boyish man called Ashley. Miss Scarlett pleads, and begs, and manipulates herself into the arms of her love Ashley. But Ashley wants to marry Melanie, a character with so little emotion you would think she's a recovering crystal meth addict. Soon, the Yankee rascals attack Scarlett's simple home, a lavish mansion full to the brim with slaves who "just want the best for the white folk." Scarlett is forced on the road,where she takes refuge in Atlanta, which is then burnt to the ground. Scarlett meets Rhett Butler, a gentlemen pimp who runs a seemingly very successful brothel. They hit it off, but Scarlett still wants the now married Ashley. So, when the time is right, as the wife Melanie lies dying in the other room, Scarlett pounces on the grieving Ashley. What better time to seduce a young man than when his wife is near death next door? Well, that doesn't work for our model heroine, so she falls into the arms of Mr. Butler, where they proceed with a passionate love affair that ends with rape, pregnancy, death of the child, and Mr. Butler getting so fed up with his filthy wife that he leaves her. That ends our movie. Four hours after it started. And what better quote to end the movie than the awful "For tomorrow's a new day!" in regards to Scarlett having to rush to the train station to win back her turned off husband, the pimp, but being just a tad bit to late. Which means she never leaves the mansion. It is worth mentioning two characters: Mammy and Prissy. Mammy is actually a pretty fine woman, but Prissy, oh Prissy! The most annoying and high- pitched sack of dead weight you'll ever find in film. Who happens to be a slave that is beaten regularly by our protagonist.

    I like how the movie have events from the civil war. What I don't understand about the movie is why did everyone love Scarlett and her family so much? I also don't understand how her mother was such a good role model for her? She said in the book she wanted to be a great lady like her mother, Ellen. She didn't do anything that made her a great lady. She wore face paint, and back in those days women that wore makeup was the whore. Marrying Rhett Butler was the class act(sarcasm). She also hugged Melanie's husband Ashley. They should of said what bad parents they were to raise the spoiled child like Scarlett and how they been a bad influence for her. I like Scarlett youngest sister. She was the nicest one in the family. I liked Melanie too. She was sweet.

    Though named after the ephemeral qualities of breeze, "Gone With The Wind" moves like a lead balloon. The plot? Vivien Leigh plays Scarlett O'Hara, a strong willed Southern belle who's forced to flee her lavish plantation come the outbreak of the American Civil War. Scarlett embodies the South's indefatigable spirit, the film watching as she remains strong and steadfast in the face of war, hardship and much adversity. People and loved ones die, Scarlett marries and widows a lot, but nothing will dent her optimism. "As God is my witness, they're not going to lick me!" she proclaims. "I'm going to live through this, and when it's all over, I'll never be hungry again!" You go girl. Much of the film watches as Scarlett lusts for Ashley Wilkes, a man who embodies the South's honour, codes and subsequent defeat. With Ashley's passing goes the ideal of the American South, a better time which finds itself "gone with the wind", passing into history and so oblivion. Insidious? Audiences at the time didn't think so. Nevertheless, this is a racist, wholly ahistorical film which abounds with stereotypes, which panders to the South, which nostalgically pines for and glorifies the Confederate cause, and which suggests that the Union brutalised an idyllic, simple, gallant and peaceful world. In keeping with such historical re-imaginings, the film portrays white women as perpetually elegant and menfolk as noble and dashing. Black slaves, of course, are dutiful, content, clearly incapable of an independent existence, dopey and easily duped (none of the three main black characters have real names). White Southerners, meanwhile, are portrayed as defending traditional values, the issue of slavery is ignored and the Ku Klux Klan - called a mere "political group" in the film  is portrayed as an organisation of fine Southern gentlemen formed to protect white women. Elsewhere the usual Lost Cause myths are espoused, the Confederacy's motives noble and its leaders exemplars of old-fashioned chivalry who are unfortunately defeated by violent, scheming Unionists. The point is not that the film "takes the wrong side" - the North was as bad, if not worse, than the South  but that the film is just plain stupid. Officially "Gone With the Wind" was directed by Victor Fleming. Unofficially, directors George Cukor, Sam Wood and William Cameron Menzies directed huge chunks. Producer David O. Selznick was the film's driving force, though, the man overseeing the production with customary gusto. Scarlett is typically hailed as a feminist icon and a character who boosted hopes during America's Great Depression and Dust Bowl years. But while strong willed, she's also manipulative, is forever stealing other women's men and occasionally loves being bullied and raped by dapper rich dudes. Ayn Rand in a hoop skirt, it's hard to get behind a wealthy white woman who's pretty much oblivious to the suffering of everyone else around her. Indeed, Orson Welles would famously bash "Gone With the Wind", stating that Selznick was a "fool to mistake the picture for art". Robert Altman would call the film "total ****". Malcom X would tell the story of how the film's sanitised outlook made him feel like "crying and crawling under a rug". Hilariously, Nazi Germany would ban the film. The Soviet Union would also try to ban the film for being dumb crap. Selznick would later say they hated it because the film was "too classy". But you know how communists are. They hate class. Like most artists who make dubious or outright racist films, Selznick spent much time espousing "Wind's" virtues. When black organisations threatened to boycott the film, he launched a massive PR campaign and explained that he would have black activists and Harvard professors working on the picture to "ensure that it's not racist". Worried that ticket sales might fall, he then tasked civil rights activist Walter White with ensuring that "the Negro position is greatly improved in the picture" such that it is demonstrated "that we have the greatest friendship toward them and their cause." Nevertheless, after the film's release, various black organisations signed an article stating that "we consider this work to be a glorification of the old rotten system of slavery, propaganda for race hatred and bigotry", comments which spurred Selznick to launch another PR campaign in which he proclaimed himself "a persecuted minority who also identifies with the black plight" and in which he proudly noted the benefits of his film, which "undoubtledly provided many acting roles for blacks". Such back and forth bickering is typically brushed aside today. People were simply less enlightened then, it is said. And besides, there is nothing as bad here as, say, "Birth of a Nation's" fried chicken scenes. But this misses the point. People weren't dumb in the 1930s, and "Wind's" worse elements are found even in our contemporary, enlightened age. Just look at the environment in which "Wind" was briefly re-released in 2009; "The Blind Side" was winning Oscars and America's bestselling book was a self-help guide to help kids get into heaven. In a similar way, "Wind's" not about going, or impermanence, but covertly about something else: about things staying the same, about a reactionary longing for the past, and the preserving of dubious traits and/or institutions we, like Selznick, beautify with glitz. Aesthetically, "Wind" looks amazing, with gorgeous cinematography, rich, evocative colours, beautiful browns, vibrant reds, gorgeous textures, strong camera work, opulent sets and one impressively composed scene after the next. On the flip side, it's a dumb, stiff, impersonal and ponderous melodrama. More paint-by-numbers colouring book than art, the film is the quintessential Hollywood product; the grand-mother of all event movies (the film's premiere led to several statewide holidays). Totally kitschy, its influence would remain strong even a century after it's release ("The Color Purple", "Titanic", "Cold Mountain", "Australia", "Far Away", "Heaven and Earth" etc) 3/10  Worth one viewing
