    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

"Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them.

It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"!

So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not.

The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters.

When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice.

"Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel.

(At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts.

    Few films for those in my generation could have been more anticipated than this adaptation of arguably one of the most successful video games of all time. I vividly remember spending many hours bashing buttons and whooping my sister's ass at "Street Fighter 2" on my faithful Mega Drive so surely a movie version would be equally kick-ass, especially considering the scribe behind "Die Hard" would be responsible for the film. What could go wrong? Well, other than casting, scripting, directing and producing then not much else, I suppose. I wasn't expecting much given this film's reputation but what little fun was to be had was mainly for laughing at it rather than with it. In the south-east Asian country of Shadaloo, the armed forces of General Bison (Raul Julia, in his final performance) are running rampant. When his forces kidnap a bunch of hostages and issues a Doctor Evil-style ransom demand, the Allied Nations respond by sending in Colonel Guile (Jean-Claude Van Damme) to bring the madman to justice. But Guile isn't the only one on Bison's trail - journalist Chun-Li Zang (Ming Na) has personal reasons for pursuing the general while drifters Ryu (Byron Mann) and Ken (Damian Chappa) run into local gun-runner Sagat (Wes Studi) and find themselves involved in the conflict as well. "Street Fighter" is yet another addition in the bulging 'dodgy video-game movies' sub-genre, offering little more than token gestures to the source material and instead focusing on being a generic action flick with a tongue-in-cheek feel. And this is one of its biggest faults - the game admittedly lacked the po-faced seriousness of "Mortal Kombat" (which was an equally disappointing film as well) but this feels like a straight-up comedy, were the laughs any good. But what are we to make of an announcement at Bison's base that reminds troopers to take out health insurance as Van Damme shoots everyone in sight? It's like filming a "Resident Evil" movie but making it like "Shaun Of The Dead"! Acting is almost universally wooden with the exception of Julia, who hams it up as the pantomime baddie, but I got the sense that he was simply paying the bills. It's a shame that this is his epitaph as Julia was a much better actor than this tosh deserved. There are other issues as well - the characters only really look like their game counterparts during the final battle sequence (where they all use guns!), the English character Cammy is played by Australian singer Kylie Minogue with no attempt made at an English accent and character back stories from the game are pretty much ignored - I don't recall Zangief (Andrew Bryniarski) working for Bison or Balrog (Grand L. Bush) being a good guy and the less said of Dhalsim (Roshan Seth), the better - his appearance in this movie has no relation to the game at all. Actually, the worse character by far is Blanka (Robert Mammone) who not only looks ridiculous but has very little to do besides growl and snarl - not even a decent fight scene. There is a goofy appeal to this film, a sense of stupidity than is oddly infectious and in spite of yourself, you kinda enjoy it despite the numerous faults. So unless you're a passionate fan of the series (in which case, you'll cough up blood in rage watching this), you might get some enjoyment out of it but certainly not because this is a good film because it's not. It's the very definition of a guilty pleasure.

    If you watched this film for any other reason than Zangrief you are wrong. I like cheesy 80s movies as much as the next guy. I even kind of like Time Cop in a retro, ironic, hehe he has a mullet kind of way but for the life of me I will never understand why Guile, maybe the most patriotically American characters to ever come out of Japan (With possible exception of Bandit Keith), was portrayed by Van Damme. Here we have a screenplay that was clearly written out of Steven E. de Souza's love for America and being American and killing things that aren't American, so the first thing we do (just like in every Schwarzenegger flick) is take a man who can barely speak English, or at least well enough to seem anything but miscellaneously European, slap an American flag tattoo on him and hope that Deaf people love movies based on Japanese Video Games from the 80s. In all this film is that generic 80s bad where you can still watch it. Some guys like Kylie Minogue, I guess. But going back to my first point, the only reason to watch this film is reassure yourself of your masculinity whilst at the same time releasing effeminate "Awws" for the genuinely adorable way one of the franchises biggest, sweatiest and most Russian-est guys is shown as a lovable mentally challenged bear-man.

    Colonel William Guile (Jean-Claude VanDamme) and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison (Raul Julia) and his cohorts. Who else (besides this film's director and producers) can picture Kylie Minogue as a martial artist in the military?? Not I. Apparently they thought she had the right look to be Cammy. And I guess she does. With some of the others (Dhalsim) they did not even try to stick to the video game. This is generally considered a terrible movie. And, indeed, it is a terrible movie. But give them credit for what they were trying to do -- take a game with no plot and construct a narrative out of it, utilizing several characters in a coherent way. As silly as the result might be, it worked. Perhaps "Mortal Kombat" is the better film, but this still beats the heck out of the "Mario Bros" movie... what was going on there?

    After many years, I have have to admit that this movie isn't that bad after all. Note that I didn't say it was good, just not that bad. It's camp at it's best (or worse depending on your point of reference). Both the good guys and bad guys are silly, over act and shed no blood when killed. It's a throw back to the old fashion Saturday morning serials with a hearty hero, a raving madman and pretty girls. (Flash Gordon, Buck Rodgers, etc. anyone?) With so many characters in the Street Fighter game universe, it's virtually impossible to weave every single character into the story and still maintain cohesiveness in the story. I think they did a decent job, most fans of the game should have seen their favorite characters represented. (Unlike some game to film titles.....mumble.....DOA: Dead or Alive....mumble ) Anyway, I think it's OK for what it is. They made one and let's keep it that way. What? Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li? Sorry, I don't recognized that movie.

    When I heard all the negativity about this film I just had to see it. And I can't see what the problem is with this film. Supposedly the problem was that it put more focus on comedy then martial arts, but both seemed rather well here. Many of the jokes put in seemed to get a giggle out of me such as Zangief's stupidity and Bison's lack of taking anything seriously. As for the martial arts, what is here is pretty good too such as tag team fight, a sumo wrestle and the main one with the Protagonist and the Antagonist. Another problem I suspect the film may of had was that not many of the characters were fleshed out enough, but I personally can forgive that since there isn't much room for all characters and it's nice to even see them put in here at all. The effects, while many outdated nowadays, are pretty passable and the sets were really well designed. I understand this film didn't do well for many but its one I can personally recommend if you have not seen it.

    "Street Fighter" is a typical video-game: Dumb, boring and poorly made, with zero appeal to most viewers, even those who, unlike me, can enjoy a dumb action flick as long it is entertaining. The sad thing that is "Street Fighter" is not only dumb, but also terribly boring as well. It has an idiotic plot, bad performances and many pathetic scenes that made one viewer wonder in what were the makers of this movie thinking. It also has Jean-Claude Van Damme (one of the worst actors from the entire cinema history) as the main star, and that is enough reason to stay far way from this terrible movie. The "Street Fighter" movie is just as bad as the "Resident Evil" movies.

    In the fictional South East Asian nation of Shadaloo, an international peacekeeping organisation, the Allied Nations, has sent a military force to confront the armed forces of a drug lord turned military dictator named General Bison. As the AN's personnel all wear pale blue headgear it is not difficult to work out which real-life international peacekeeping organisation they are based on. As the United Nations are not always popular in America, particularly in right-wing circles, someone in Hollywood evidently thought that they could do with some good publicity. . The AN commander, and the film's hero, Colonel William F. Guile, is supposed to be an American, even though he speaks with a foreign accent and is played by Jean-Claude Van Damme. Given that the AN is a multinational organisation there is no reason why a Belgian could not be in command, but the film was evidently made on the basis of the American assumption that they will always be in charge of any international peacekeeping efforts. Guile's female second-in command, Cammy, is supposed to be British, even though played by the Australian Kylie Minogue, presumably reflecting the view that the Special Relationship means that Britain will always play second fiddle in supporting America's efforts. (At least Minogue does attempt a reasonably credible English accent). When Bison kidnaps several dozen humanitarian workers, and the AN's High Command want to appease him by paying the twenty billion dollar ransom he is demanding, Guile leads a mutiny and mounts his own operation to free the hostages. Several other characters play important roles in the subsequent developments, including Chun-Li Zang, a beautiful Chinese journalist with her own reasons for seeking revenge against Bison, Bison's ally the arms dealer Sagat, and Ryu and Ken, two con-men who get caught up in the action after trying to sell Bison fake weapons. The film resembles a sort of cross between a James Bond and a martial arts movie, although it never reaches the standards of any of the Bonds, even the weaker ones like "On Her Majesty's Secret Service" or "Quantum of Solace". (It doesn't measure up to the standards of many martial arts films either). The Bond influence is most apparent in Ra&uacute;l Juli&aacute;'s characterisation of Bison as an evil megalomaniac with dreams of world domination, and in the final assault by the AN forces on Bison's headquarters. Bison comes across as a cross between a Goldfinger-style Bond villain, Hitler (his uniform with its death's-head insignia is reminiscent of an SS officer) and Pol Pot (the Shadaloo flag is that of the Khmer Rouge with a green rather than a red background). This was Juli&aacute;'s final feature film- he died soon after completing it- and he is about the only actor to emerge with any credit. Van Damme, however, is as wooden as he normally is, and even his fight scenes, normally something he does well, are not very convincing. Kylie originally came to public attention as an actress (in the TV series "Neighbours"), but her performance here shows just why she has been well advised to concentrate subsequently on singing rather than acting. About the supporting cast, the less said the better. "Street Fighter" is based on a video game, and it is a general rule that whenever the words "based on a video game" appear at the beginning of a movie, they can also be translated as "Don't expect a cinematic masterpiece". There are a few partial exceptions to this rule- "Prince of Persia", for example, was not exactly a masterpiece but still managed to be a pretty decent action-adventure film- but this is not one of them. The acting, Julia apart, is wooden, the plot clich&eacute;d, the action sequences unconvincing and the attempts at humour leaden. The Bond films, at their best, can take implausible story lines like this one and turn them into stylish, sophisticated entertainment. Director Steven E. de Souza has been unable to turn "Street Fighter" into anything other than a prize turkey, devoid of style, sophistication or entertainment value. 3/10

    Col. Guile and various other martial arts heroes fight against the tyranny of Dictator M. Bison and his cohorts. Based on the video game series of the same name, this movie is a very silly movie, but at the same time, it is a whole lot of fun to watch! No kidding, Street Fighter is a good movie, it's a silly movie, but it's also good at the same time. This movie has some really silly bits in it, especially a lot of the one-liners, but at the same time, the movie is loads of fun, it's a big guilty pleasure for me. The reason why this movie didn't do so well was because of the time that it came out. When this movie came out, it was released when the video game series didn't have much of a plot. It was like this: M. Bison hosts a tournament and heroes try to stop him, and that's not much of a plot if you ask me. On the whole, this movie is hokey and silly, but yet it takes the silliness to something of an art form, making the movie enjoyable. Street Fighter is not one of the greatest movies ever made, but I found it enjoyable, and in fact, I think that I have become a fan of it! The thing that really makes this movie enjoyable is the performance of M. Bison, played by the late Raul Julia (this movie was released after his death). Julia's performance as M. Bison was the best in the movie, he was a scene stealer, every time that he appeared on the movie screen, he drew my attention away from everybody else, he couldn't have done better. Julia makes Bison likable, he's serious, he's funny, and he's hammy, especially near the end of the movie. While Jean-Claude Van Damme and others were good, none of them were as great as Raul Julia. It's a shame that Julia was dying when this movie was made, because I could hardly tell that he was sick. Oh well, he's gone but not forgotten, as many people said that it was his performance as M. Bison that saved this movie. The acting is not Oscar-worthy, but nevertheless, the cast seemed to care about how good a job they did, especially Julia, as he did a fine job. So all in all, while this movie is rather silly and not one of the greatest movies ever made, it's still enjoyable all the same, because as I said earlier, it takes silliness and cheesiness and it elevates it to an enjoyable level. This is another one of those movies that when you watch it, you need to keep an open mind about it, because if you don't then the chances are that you will end up either disliking the movie, or even hating it. And I can't see how somebody could hate it, as it is on the level of so bad it's good, and like I said in the first paragraph, it's become a guilty pleasure of mine. So if you enjoy the video games, then try to keep an open mind when you watch the movie, because if you don't, then you probably won't like it. Street Fighter is a movie that is definitely not a perfect movie, but nevertheless, there are so many things to like about it, and when you watch it, you will hopefully see what I mean. 10/10

    Jean-Claude Van Damme is back in action as a Colonel no less who, in the time honoured tradition of the fake Hulk Hogan-type wrestling matches, challenges Saddam Hussein look-alike, General Bison (Raul Julia), to a fight of all the ages. The filmmakers tried to make this film funny, which is an appropriate strategy given how preposterous the plot is. Unfortunately, the jokes usually don't quite come off the ground, though a couple worked: like when Raul Julia claimed that he was creating killing machines for the good of mankind. That joke made me think of those American policymakers who say that they want world peace, but neglect to tell their audience all the violent things they are prepared to do to achieve universal peace. Another one was Raul Julia's claim that he could actually make one of his Bison bucks convertible into just five English pounds just by holding the Queen hostage. You don't have to be an expert in monetary policy and fluctuating exchange rates to realize why this claim is so laughable. But aside from that, the jokes persistently fell flat. In addition to the bad jokes, the other problem with the film is wall-to-wall scenes with property being destroyed as a cheap ploy for generating entertainment. Finally the most unfortunate thing about this movie is how it wastes the prodigious talents of some really great actors. Wes Studi was unbelievably good as the Heron native Mogwa in "Last of the Mohicans" (with Daniel Day Lewis and Madeleine Stowe), but his acting gifts are wasted here as the villain Victor Sagat. At least, Studi had a sense of humour throughout this picture. Similarly Roshan Seth delivered wonderful performances in Attenborough's film Gandhi and David Lean's Passage of India. But in this movie, Seth is reduced to a nerdy scientist, though he is capable of so much more than this. How did Seth, given his remarkable acting career, end up in a movie like this? Finally Simon Callow gave a memorable performance in Milos Forman's Amadeus, but here he is reduced to a Neville Chamberlain-type appeaser. Never have I seen so many good actors wasted in a movie.

    More like "Sure you can't"! I'm a fan of the Street Fighter video games. Like the Super Mario Bros Movie, this movie sucks. Why should this movie deserve a super-sized shoryuken with a side order of hadoukens? Let's find out... Let's take a look at the actors first. Jean-Claude Van Damme as Guile? BZZZZT! Jean-Claude Van Damme was born in Belgium and his accent doesn't match with Guile. Couldn't you get Sylvester Stallone to play Guile? And then there's a guy called Raul Julia. Now, I know what your thinking "How could you be so insensitive? This is Raul Julia's last movie! He died after the movie was made!" Well... I'll let Raul Julia go... For now... Hold on! Why is Dee Jay a villain in this movie? He's just a happy-go-luck Jamaican kick-boxer in the Street Fighter games! Why is he a villain?!! Okay, I'll get on with it. Now, on to the relationship with this game. Did the people who made this movie actually play the game? It doesn't sound like it. All the movie is about is corny dialog, phony fight scenes, and special effects so bad that it makes Baby Geniuses look like the original Star Wars Trilogy. There are movies based on video games that have no effort whatsoever and this movie, along with the Super Mario Bros movie, is no exception. If you disagree with me, then what the hell were you smoking? If you're a fan of the Street Fighter video games(Like myself), I suggest that you stay far away from this movie unless you want to pay tribute to Raul Julia.
