    In 15th century France animals were held as responsible for their actions as humans. All of the court cases in the film are based on actual court records including the opening scene. A man and a donkey are about to be hanged for having carnal knowledge of each other. A local parish took up a petition attesting to the good character of the donkey; saying it would never have willingly participated and so it was pardoned on the spot. This really happened according to an interview on the radio. The main case is a pig charged with murder makes it a different kind of film noir. The costumes, sets and actors are superb. Subtle humor is sprinkled throughout. This is one of those rare films that left me and friends completely satisfied as having watched it.

    I'm surprised this movie is so unknown! From the beginning, prepare to be impressed with the accurate visual detailing of mid fifteenth century France. I was wowed by the costumes, sets, and extras (who appear plucked straight from a period painting). The dialogue can be slightly convoluted at times, and a few of the characterizations felt slightly strained, but these are minor complaints. The movie, besides featuring a great understated performance by Colin Firth, also showcases a talented supporting cast. Ian Holm, who played Bilbo in the Lord of the Rings, is great as the knowledgeable priest. Jim Carter, as Firth's right hand man, is a wonderful and versatile actor (check him out in Downton Abbey). And finally Nicol Williamson as the nobleman, who has many opportunities for over-acting, but instead crafts a believable character and carries off his role with brilliant understatement. The premise, that all the trials presented in the film are based on actual 'crimes', generates much interest in the plot and makes this movie more than worth watching!

    The joy of this film is the acting - it is amazing. Donald Pleasance's speech for the prosecution at the trial of the pig has you hanging on every word as if you were there in the courtroom. The witch is so telling too - so haunting in her sense of herself. Michael Gough's judge has such depth and irony, and the grand seigneur picks up on the flippancy and boredom of the upper classes in XIVth Century France with such understatement. The use of terms like the French "maitre" (for the lawyers) and the Latin "domini" (for the priest)is exactly right. "Master" or "Lord" would be quite wrong. There is no weak link at all - this is subtle individual and ensemble playing with few parallels. Where the film has attracted criticism is over the alleged anachronism in Colin Firth's performance. I beg to disagree. Putting animals on trial was not accepted universally in Europe, and was not enjoined by the Church at all. Contemporary people could and did disagree with it in principle, otherwise it would have spread all over the Catholic world. Young lawyers were legendary for their promiscuity. People could and did bridge the divide between those outside society and those within it, and in certain realms and in certain reigns this was actively encouraged. City people did disdain the countryside. Humanity was less tender than now but charity of all kinds was encouraged, and where Church Law appeared to limit kindness, there were people ready to ridicule the Church. Firth's performance smacks of the Age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, and indeed the Canterbury Tales, where irony enabled a new free thinking under the nose of the Inquisition. His depiction of the young generous idealist who is lusty, self-seeking, obtuse and arrogant is a depiction of a type of person throughout recorded history. The incredible detail in the film gives a rightness to the production rarely seen in films of this category - the back cloth to the mystery play is a medieval wonder in itself. The town itself seems a tad small to warrant resident advocates but this is a very minor detail. The inn acting as a brothel is a good touch. The calamitous XIV Century was one of popular revolt and a refusal to accept the iniquities of the class system. This film, with the ominous threat of the Back Death advancing in the background, evokes those uneasy times with a relaxed sureness that makes it a real gem

    This is known as "The Advocate" to most people outside England, where this film was made. It's no surprise the ultra-liberal BBC financially backed this film. Boy, it seems European filmmakers hate Catholics more than the North American ones, at least some of the European movies I've seen. This movie is a prime example of British garbage. Hollywood doesn't monopolize the market when it comes to sleaze, believe me. This story is the supposed expose of the Fifteenth Century Church where church officials are all not only corrupted but perverted. Nudity is no big deal in films, not since the '60s, but this film also gives us tales of men having sex with animals. This is sick stuff.

    Beautiful exploration of premodern atmosphere, of time's masks and of faith. Show in rule's body and ambiguity of innocence. Signs, symbols and respiration of a era. Misticism, sin and a strange advocate lost in a deceptive world. A great character in Ian Holm acting and subtle recreation of gestures of every period. At first sight, the love is only motive of characters actions. Love for law, for power or money, prestige or personal image, for ideal or for a woman. But, the essence is the sin, like result of corruption, hypocrisy and prejudices. Richard Curtois is not only an outsider, the stranger but principal danger for community. The desertion of Paris is capital error . The endeavor to move life in his rational limits- a cruel blasphemy. Image of his failure is not the departure, but the presence of father Albertus in a place who destroys every innocence's shadow. In spite of atmosphere, it is not a historical film. The reality after September 11 is Medieval in same measure and same saving knight is expecting.

    This film deserves to be far better known. It's clever, fun, and a terrific balance of successful Hollywood pacing with non-traditional, non-Hollywood storytelling. Yes, it's a historical murder mystery. But it's a film about excess, as is the recent Marie Antoinette, but this one is darker and more substantive. The dialogue is sharp, often funny, and vaguely unsettling. Like all good films, several elements work together. The photography, the costuming, the soundtrack, and the characterization all underscore the script's emphasis on indulgence. It's really very well done.

    This period flick had much going for it- BBC backing, an excellent cast including Colin Firth and Lord of the Ring's Ian Holm- and pretty decent sets. It is quite well shot. It promises us that "When murder is the motive, seduction is the last defence". Sadly it just doesn't work. A sort of anachronistic liberalism just suffocates the life out of the whole thing and gives it a phonier ring than a $8 note. Colin Firth is the crusading lawyer who uses all the jargon of a "right-on" legal aid lawyer who retires to digs in Islington for the night. But this is medieval France- not the East End of London. We have the dreary spectacle of this uber-liberal goody-two-shoes Firth protecting the compulsory ethnic minority figure plus all the brute beasts of the land against the evil and conspiratorial Lord of the Manor. Although some of it is funny, most of it is just embarrassingly clumsy. There is plenty of admirable full frontal nudity, but sadly that is probably one of the few reasons to bother watching this mediocre cinematic effort. Although it claims historical authenticity, believe me- that is just tosh.

    Just watched this film again on video (purchased off Ebay), and this film is simply magical. I love films of all kinds from fantasy - Holes, Chocolat, Batman, through drama and thrillers, but what I love best is the telling of a story, and the way it's phrased. Hour of the Pig is just that, an excellent story developed in layers, that takes its time, because it does a fantastic job of developing the characters, mostly through the dying art of great dialogue, and some of the best British actors around. Colin Firth and Ian Holm underpin an excellent cast, rich in dialogue, with a fantastic story. And there's the rub, you have to like stories, as there's very little action, just a fascinating twist through medieval France. Films like this remind me why I go to the cinema which is where I first saw it over 10 years ago. It's a crime this doesn't have a DVD release. It never goes for less than &pound;10 secondhand, and often tops &pound;15, for a secondhand VIDEO. Come on, whoever owns the rights to this, and get it out on DVD.

    Another missing review! So here we go again: Colin Firth is a medieval lawyer who somewhat inexplicably ends up defending a pig accused of murder! As grim as some of the film is, this is basically a satire or black comedy. It is no NAME OF THE ROSE, as some claim, but it is not a total disaster either. The topics touched on throughout this odd drama are as timely today as they were then: bigotry, power, ignorance, superstition, venality, and so on. Several veteran British actors have parts in this French-British co-production, including Ian Holm, Michael Gough, Donald Pleasance and Nicol Williamson. The movie went through a very curious name change when it reached these shores. To say the American title is not terribly descriptive and downright dull is an understatement. Check it out.

    For starters, the movie suffers the hidden quality of slowly becoming a Monty Python comedy. The opening shows a donkey getting let free from his charges of sexual conduct, while his human master dangles from his rope. The movie has its moments of comic relief, that helps the drama part of the movie lose its drama. To keep the audience interested in the trial and the dull lifestyle of France in this era, sex and nudity is thrown into the mix every so often. This is one of the movies strong points as the audience welcomes it with open arms. Although this brings more comedy into the drama, it works. Overall, the movie does not last that long, making the movie more watchable. If it was to drag on for another 30 minutes to an hour, the movie would lose its flavor and not be enjoyable. For what it is, it is a nice story with some wonderful moments.

I beg to disagree. Putting animals on trial was not accepted universally in Europe, and was not enjoined by the Church at all. Contemporary people could and did disagree with it in principle, otherwise it would have spread all over the Catholic world. Young lawyers were legendary for their promiscuity. People could and did bridge the divide between those outside society and those within it, and in certain realms and in certain reigns this was actively encouraged. City people did disdain the countryside. Humanity was less tender than now but charity of all kinds was encouraged, and where Church Law appeared to limit kindness, there were people ready to ridicule the Church. Firth's performance smacks of the Age of Petrarch and Boccaccio, and indeed the Canterbury Tales, where irony enabled a new free thinking under the nose of the Inquisition. His depiction of the young generous idealist who is lusty, self-seeking, obtuse and arrogant is a depiction of a type of person throughout recorded history. The incredible detail in the film gives a rightness to the production rarely seen in films of this category - the back cloth to the mystery play is a medieval wonder in itself. The town itself seems a tad small to warrant resident advocates but this is a very minor detail. The inn acting as a brothel is a good touch. The calamitous XIV Century was one of popular revolt and a refusal to accept the iniquities of the class system. This film, with the ominous threat of the Back Death advancing in the background, evokes those uneasy times with a relaxed sureness that makes it a real gem

    This is known as "The Advocate" to most people outside England, where this film was made. It's no surprise the ultra-liberal BBC financially backed this film. Boy, it seems European filmmakers hate Catholics more than the North American ones, at least some of the European movies I've seen. This movie is a prime example of British garbage. Hollywood doesn't monopolize the market when it comes to sleaze, believe me. This story is the supposed expose of the Fifteenth Century Church where church officials are all not only corrupted but perverted. Nudity is no big deal in films, not since the '60s, but this film also gives us tales of men having sex with animals. This is sick stuff.

    Beautiful exploration of premodern atmosphere, of time's masks and of faith. Show in rule's body and ambiguity of innocence. Signs, symbols and respiration of a era. Misticism, sin and a strange advocate lost in a deceptive world. A great character in Ian Holm acting and subtle recreation of gestures of every period. At first sight, the love is only motive of characters actions. Love for law, for power or money, prestige or personal image, for ideal or for a woman. But, the essence is the sin, like result of corruption, hypocrisy and prejudices. Richard Curtois is not only an outsider, the stranger but principal danger for community. The desertion of Paris is capital error . The endeavor to move life in his rational limits- a cruel blasphemy. Image of his failure is not the departure, but the presence of father Albertus in a place who destroys every innocence's shadow. In spite of atmosphere, it is not a historical film. The reality after September 11 is Medieval in same measure and same saving knight is expecting.

    This film deserves to be far better known. It's clever, fun, and a terrific balance of successful Hollywood pacing with non-traditional, non-Hollywood storytelling. Yes, it's a historical murder mystery. But it's a film about excess, as is the recent Marie Antoinette, but this one is darker and more substantive. The dialogue is sharp, often funny, and vaguely unsettling. Like all good films, several elements work together. The photography, the costuming, the soundtrack, and the characterization all underscore the script's emphasis on indulgence. It's really very well done.

    This period flick had much going for it- BBC backing, an excellent cast including Colin Firth and Lord of the Ring's Ian Holm- and pretty decent sets. It is quite well shot. It promises us that "When murder is the motive, seduction is the last defence". Sadly it just doesn't work. A sort of anachronistic liberalism just suffocates the life out of the whole thing and gives it a phonier ring than a $8 note. Colin Firth is the crusading lawyer who uses all the jargon of a "right-on" legal aid lawyer who retires to digs in Islington for the night. But this is medieval France- not the East End of London. We have the dreary spectacle of this uber-liberal goody-two-shoes Firth protecting the compulsory ethnic minority figure plus all the brute beasts of the land against the evil and conspiratorial Lord of the Manor. Although some of it is funny, most of it is just embarrassingly clumsy. There is plenty of admirable full frontal nudity, but sadly that is probably one of the few reasons to bother watching this mediocre cinematic effort. Although it claims historical authenticity, believe me- that is just tosh.

    Just watched this film again on video (purchased off Ebay), and this film is simply magical. I love films of all kinds from fantasy - Holes, Chocolat, Batman, through drama and thrillers, but what I love best is the telling of a story, and the way it's phrased. Hour of the Pig is just that, an excellent story developed in layers, that takes its time, because it does a fantastic job of developing the characters, mostly through the dying art of great dialogue, and some of the best British actors around. Colin Firth and Ian Holm underpin an excellent cast, rich in dialogue, with a fantastic story. And there's the rub, you have to like stories, as there's very little action, just a fascinating twist through medieval France. Films like this remind me why I go to the cinema which is where I first saw it over 10 years ago. It's a crime this doesn't have a DVD release. It never goes for less than &pound;10 secondhand, and often tops &pound;15, for a secondhand VIDEO. Come on, whoever owns the rights to this, and get it out on DVD.

    Another missing review! So here we go again: Colin Firth is a medieval lawyer who somewhat inexplicably ends up defending a pig accused of murder! As grim as some of the film is, this is basically a satire or black comedy. It is no NAME OF THE ROSE, as some claim, but it is not a total disaster either. The topics touched on throughout this odd drama are as timely today as they were then: bigotry, power, ignorance, superstition, venality, and so on. Several veteran British actors have parts in this French-British co-production, including Ian Holm, Michael Gough, Donald Pleasance and Nicol Williamson. The movie went through a very curious name change when it reached these shores. To say the American title is not terribly descriptive and downright dull is an understatement. Check it out.

    For starters, the movie suffers the hidden quality of slowly becoming a Monty Python comedy. The opening shows a donkey getting let free from his charges of sexual conduct, while his human master dangles from his rope. The movie has its moments of comic relief, that helps the drama part of the movie lose its drama. To keep the audience interested in the trial and the dull lifestyle of France in this era, sex and nudity is thrown into the mix every so often. This is one of the movies strong points as the audience welcomes it with open arms. Although this brings more comedy into the drama, it works. Overall, the movie does not last that long, making the movie more watchable. If it was to drag on for another 30 minutes to an hour, the movie would lose its flavor and not be enjoyable. For what it is, it is a nice story with some wonderful moments.
