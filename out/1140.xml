 <storyline>

    Try stepping back in time to the days when health retreats were the rage for those who could afford them. Buckle your seat belts for an unbelievably funny comedy. Can't say enough how much I liked this one as well as the performance by the entire cast. There are multiple plots and sub-plots and, collectively, they form a 3 ring circus of entertainment. Enjoy and laugh out loud. The only problem is that I can't stop wanting to watch this again. Just like Ferris Beuller's Day Off! Once you have seen the movie, go visit the Mohonk Mountain House in upstate NY.

    Did you find funny any film involving characters named "Focker"? How about "The Hangover"? Did you think "Avatar" was well-acted or well-written? Was any "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" film silly? Was "Titanic" without historic inaccuracies? Just curious. The above questions embody the primary criticisms of Wellville. Leaving out, of course, the obligatory "poop jokes are gross" remarks. I'm certain those who lodge this complaint never were amused by scatological humor. Or ever told such a joke. Of course not. If someone you liked told you a joke, then, presuming the delivery was similar, were told the same joke by someone you despise, would you laugh both times? Be truthful. Point being this: Is the movie really as bad as you say, or are you unable (or maybe unwilling?) to suspend your disbelief because you're pre-programmed so to do? Taste may be subjective, but is also subject to manipulation. So now ask yourself: What was the last movie you thought was great, whether others liked it or not?

    I also can not fathom the low rating. One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

    John Harvey Kellogg may have been the inventor of the corn flake and peanut butter, but his time spent running the Battle Creek sanitarium is the subject of the semi-biographical comedy, The Road To Wellville. At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

I have now also read the book and found it also to be good, and now I just want to see the movie again!! It is not only a movie filled with great actors, but a film that made me laugh out loud, even when I am sitting alone!! It is a movie that went to video way too quickly! I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.

But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.

    Try stepping back in time to the days when health retreats were the rage for those who could afford them. Buckle your seat belts for an unbelievably funny comedy. Can't say enough how much I liked this one as well as the performance by the entire cast. There are multiple plots and sub-plots and, collectively, they form a 3 ring circus of entertainment. Enjoy and laugh out loud. The only problem is that I can't stop wanting to watch this again. Just like Ferris Beuller's Day Off! Once you have seen the movie, go visit the Mohonk Mountain House in upstate NY.

    Did you find funny any film involving characters named "Focker"? How about "The Hangover"? Did you think "Avatar" was well-acted or well-written? Was any "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" film silly? Was "Titanic" without historic inaccuracies? Just curious. The above questions embody the primary criticisms of Wellville. Leaving out, of course, the obligatory "poop jokes are gross" remarks. I'm certain those who lodge this complaint never were amused by scatological humor. Or ever told such a joke. Of course not. If someone you liked told you a joke, then, presuming the delivery was similar, were told the same joke by someone you despise, would you laugh both times? Be truthful. Point being this: Is the movie really as bad as you say, or are you unable (or maybe unwilling?) to suspend your disbelief because you're pre-programmed so to do? Taste may be subjective, but is also subject to manipulation. So now ask yourself: What was the last movie you thought was great, whether others liked it or not?

    I also can not fathom the low rating. One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

    John Harvey Kellogg may have been the inventor of the corn flake and peanut butter, but his time spent running the Battle Creek sanitarium is the subject of the semi-biographical comedy, The Road To Wellville. At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

    I am shocked to read all the bad reviews from folk that have seen this movie!! I have seen it so many times and loved it every time!! I have now also read the book and found it also to be good, and now I just want to see the movie again!! It is not only a movie filled with great actors, but a film that made me laugh out loud, even when I am sitting alone!! It is a movie that went to video way too quickly! I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

    I am shocked to read all the bad reviews from folk that have seen this movie!! I have seen it so many times and loved it every time!! I have now also read the book and found it also to be good, and now I just want to see the movie again!! It is not only a movie filled with great actors, but a film that made me laugh out loud, even when I am sitting alone!! It is a movie that went to video way too quickly! I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.

    Try stepping back in time to the days when health retreats were the rage for those who could afford them. Buckle your seat belts for an unbelievably funny comedy. Can't say enough how much I liked this one as well as the performance by the entire cast. There are multiple plots and sub-plots and, collectively, they form a 3 ring circus of entertainment. Enjoy and laugh out loud. The only problem is that I can't stop wanting to watch this again. Just like Ferris Beuller's Day Off! Once you have seen the movie, go visit the Mohonk Mountain House in upstate NY.

    Did you find funny any film involving characters named "Focker"? How about "The Hangover"? Did you think "Avatar" was well-acted or well-written? Was any "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" film silly? Was "Titanic" without historic inaccuracies? Just curious. The above questions embody the primary criticisms of Wellville. Leaving out, of course, the obligatory "poop jokes are gross" remarks. I'm certain those who lodge this complaint never were amused by scatological humor. Or ever told such a joke. Of course not. If someone you liked told you a joke, then, presuming the delivery was similar, were told the same joke by someone you despise, would you laugh both times? Be truthful. Point being this: Is the movie really as bad as you say, or are you unable (or maybe unwilling?) to suspend your disbelief because you're pre-programmed so to do? Taste may be subjective, but is also subject to manipulation. So now ask yourself: What was the last movie you thought was great, whether others liked it or not?

    I also can not fathom the low rating. One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

    John Harvey Kellogg may have been the inventor of the corn flake and peanut butter, but his time spent running the Battle Creek sanitarium is the subject of the semi-biographical comedy, The Road To Wellville. At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

It is not only a movie filled with great actors, but a film that made me laugh out loud, even when I am sitting alone!! It is a movie that went to video way too quickly! I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.

    Try stepping back in time to the days when health retreats were the rage for those who could afford them. Buckle your seat belts for an unbelievably funny comedy. Can't say enough how much I liked this one as well as the performance by the entire cast. There are multiple plots and sub-plots and, collectively, they form a 3 ring circus of entertainment. Enjoy and laugh out loud. The only problem is that I can't stop wanting to watch this again. Just like Ferris Beuller's Day Off! Once you have seen the movie, go visit the Mohonk Mountain House in upstate NY.

    Did you find funny any film involving characters named "Focker"? How about "The Hangover"? Did you think "Avatar" was well-acted or well-written? Was any "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" film silly? Was "Titanic" without historic inaccuracies? Just curious. The above questions embody the primary criticisms of Wellville. Leaving out, of course, the obligatory "poop jokes are gross" remarks. I'm certain those who lodge this complaint never were amused by scatological humor. Or ever told such a joke. Of course not. If someone you liked told you a joke, then, presuming the delivery was similar, were told the same joke by someone you despise, would you laugh both times? Be truthful. Point being this: Is the movie really as bad as you say, or are you unable (or maybe unwilling?) to suspend your disbelief because you're pre-programmed so to do? Taste may be subjective, but is also subject to manipulation. So now ask yourself: What was the last movie you thought was great, whether others liked it or not?

    I also can not fathom the low rating. One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

    John Harvey Kellogg may have been the inventor of the corn flake and peanut butter, but his time spent running the Battle Creek sanitarium is the subject of the semi-biographical comedy, The Road To Wellville. At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.

    Try stepping back in time to the days when health retreats were the rage for those who could afford them. Buckle your seat belts for an unbelievably funny comedy. Can't say enough how much I liked this one as well as the performance by the entire cast. There are multiple plots and sub-plots and, collectively, they form a 3 ring circus of entertainment. Enjoy and laugh out loud. The only problem is that I can't stop wanting to watch this again. Just like Ferris Beuller's Day Off! Once you have seen the movie, go visit the Mohonk Mountain House in upstate NY.

    Did you find funny any film involving characters named "Focker"? How about "The Hangover"? Did you think "Avatar" was well-acted or well-written? Was any "Lord of the Rings" or "Harry Potter" film silly? Was "Titanic" without historic inaccuracies? Just curious. The above questions embody the primary criticisms of Wellville. Leaving out, of course, the obligatory "poop jokes are gross" remarks. I'm certain those who lodge this complaint never were amused by scatological humor. Or ever told such a joke. Of course not. If someone you liked told you a joke, then, presuming the delivery was similar, were told the same joke by someone you despise, would you laugh both times? Be truthful. Point being this: Is the movie really as bad as you say, or are you unable (or maybe unwilling?) to suspend your disbelief because you're pre-programmed so to do? Taste may be subjective, but is also subject to manipulation. So now ask yourself: What was the last movie you thought was great, whether others liked it or not?

    I also can not fathom the low rating. One of only a small handful of comedies that I will watch repeatedly. As other reviewers have said, George young and old is great. It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

It's a superb ensemble though. Hopkins performance as Dr. Kellogg easily rivals Dr. Lecter. For me Cusack's second best work. Colm Meaney's best without a doubt. Camryn Manheim's small but pivotal role always brings on a smile:) I only gave it 9 stars, but that's because I'm a tough critic. It's a spectacularly good movie. It just isn't at that stratospheric ten level. IE Star Wars IV combined with being seven years old, or Clerks. If you haven't seen it yet, do so.

    I just had to comment on this movie having seen the rating. There must be cohort of reviewers here without a sense of humor. If you have to explain a joke to someone you've already lost. This was a movie I originally saw on a whim, and I thought it was just hilarious. I'm in the medical profession and really enjoyed to jabs it took at the medicine of the time. I'm sure in 50 years we'll be doing the same thing to all the health crocks we see today. Actually, things probably haven't changed that much. This movie would appeal most to people who like slapstick off-beat comedies. It is well acted and written, fast paced, and just a pleasure. When I have to recommend a sleeper comedy that I think has been overlooked this one is on my short list.

    A thoroughly appalling "comedy" detailing the wacky misadventures at an early 20th century health farm run by bizarre cereal magnate Dr. John Kellogg. Purportedly based on real events, one is hard-pressed to find much to laugh about in this over-long and criminally unfunny film. Anthony Hopkins, sporting buck teeth, has been drafted to play the nutty Kellogg. The events at the health farm largely unfold through the eyes of newly converted health maven Bridget Fonda and her less enthused husband Matthew Broderick, who is dragged along to have his system cleared of impurities. It is open for debate how much on screen is indeed factual, but it is certainly not open for debate how such a debacle could have been conceived with the talent involved. Director Alan Parker is responsible for some of our best dramas, including Midnight Express and Mississippi Burning. The cast is stocked with familiar faces, who have had far better days elsewhere. The humor is almost completely one-sided in scatological references and bodily functions - if you think the idea of someone getting a yogurt enema is the height of hilarity, then this is definitely the film for you. The film is also awash in gratuitous nudity, but no amount of eye candy (and much of it would not qualify for that description) can distract from the film's glaring shortcomings. Hopkins throws himself into the role of Kellogg, but it is little more than a cartoon character. Fonda alternates between nagging and dishrag in a dreadfully uninteresting role. Broderick fares best from the cast, largely because he is playing the only semi-developed character and the only one remotely normal or sympathetic. It is also a pleasant surprise how enticing he looks when naked - that close-up on the vibrating platform was a real eye-opener. John Cusack is on hand, but why is anyone's guess. His subplot - playing a nephew of one of Kellogg's patients involved in a shady scheme - goes no where and takes up too much screen time. Ditto, Dana Carvey as Kellogg's deranged son. Both subplots could have been completely excised from the film without anyone noticing and making the proceedings blessedly shorter. Camryn Manheim is light years beyond obnoxious as Fonda's confidante at the health farm. Truly there is literally nothing that works in this film. There is nary a chuckle to be found in its morass of jokes on poop, enemas, flatulence and body fluids. At the end, the question lingers as to how so many talented people ended up in this mess?

    John Harvey Kellogg may have been the inventor of the corn flake and peanut butter, but his time spent running the Battle Creek sanitarium is the subject of the semi-biographical comedy, The Road To Wellville. At the sanitarium Dr. Kellogg taught of the dangers of eating meat, having sex, and even masturbation (after all, "an erection is a flagpole on your grave"). Without meat and sex, there's plenty of time for Dr. Kellogg's favorite pastime, enemas, with the occasional yogurt enema thrown in for good measure. Although not 100% biographical, based on the novel of the same name by T. Coraghessan Boyle, there's a lot more truth in The Road To Wellville than we'd like to think. After all, fact is stranger than fiction. Anthony Hopkins portrayal of the Dr. is an Oscar worthy performance. His portrayal of Dr. Kellogg shows him to be crazy, insistent, misguided, and even likable, all at the same time. With chompers a beaver would envy, Dr. Kellogg has a voice and presence all his own. Bridget Fonda and Matthew Broderick are well placed as the couple who's visiting 'The San' in hope of saving their marriage. Eleanor Lightbody is old hat to the San (this being her third visit) but Will Lightbody's rookie year is met with confusion, resistance and embarrassment, as he fantasies about the beautiful Nurse Irene Graves (Traci Lind) in the nude and wonders if he should add hallucinations to his list of ailments. While on the train to Battle Creek, the Lightbody's meet Charles (John Cusack) and breakfast cereal entrepreneur, who, once he arrives in Battle Creek, realizes he's in over his head with his fast talking sleaze ball partner, Goodloe Bender (brilliantly played by Michael Lerner, whom you may recall in similar roles in the films of the Coen brothers). It would be amiss not to mention George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), Dr. Kellogg's adopted delinquent adult son, who's perpetually covered in filth and returns to the San on occasion to ask for money and look at the naked women. In humorous flashbacks we learn of George's youth (Jacob Reynolds, whom you may know from Gummo (1997)) and gain a glimpse into his stubbornness. The film feels like a cross between the works of Terry Gilliam and Mike Judge. The cinematography and use of seemingly pointless inventions as set decoration bring a Gilliamesque feel to the film, while the defined, and specific looking, characters are reminiscent of Judges work in both, film and animation. The comedy is off beat and fueled by awkward moments, a cartoonish ragtime influenced score, and unique characters, such as the Dr. Lionel Badger, who "wrote an excellent piece on the clitoris". Badger, although a fellow vegetarian, shows up at the San to put a wrench is Dr. Kellogg's teaching on abstinence. Other characters, like Mr. Unpronounceable (Alexander Slanksins) from Russia, who has a problem with flatulence, and Ida Muntz (Laura Flynn Boyle) with her green skin condition, add to the well rounded cast of unique characters at the San. For an offbeat comedy full of characters and situations that will make you laugh, and scratch your head in wonder, while simultaneously amazing you with the 'health practices' of years gone by, you can't ask for much more than The Road to Wellville.

    I am shocked to read all the bad reviews from folk that have seen this movie!! I have seen it so many times and loved it every time!! I have now also read the book and found it also to be good, and now I just want to see the movie again!! It is not only a movie filled with great actors, but a film that made me laugh out loud, even when I am sitting alone!! It is a movie that went to video way too quickly! I had never even heard of the film before one random day in a random dusty old video shelf... I RECOMMEND this film to all!!

    I never even knew about this film when it came out. Since I hear it only grossed 6.5 million that explains why. The producers probably didn't even keep in the theaters a week. I can't explain what makes a film flop at the box office, but this one certainly didn't deserve it. From start to finish I was totally enraptured by this witty story of a man who held views so controversial they are practically comical all by themselves. The movie is based on a novel which is a work of fiction, but it nevertheless draws its subject matter from some very true aspects of Dr. Kellogg's life that are quite unusual and almost always surprising. As these surprises are revealed to you throughout the film, they come as even more of a shock every time. There are a number of stories told throughout the sanitarium and each is a delight in and of itself. The stories all manage to interweave, sometimes in very comical ways, and despite their comedy, teach some very practical lessons. It is almost satirical. I give this film two thumbs up. Don't watch it in mixed company and it certainly isn't appropriate for children. But for those with a mature attitude and an appreciation of the health nut culture, it will make for a laugh-filled evening.

    Based on the novel by T.C. Boyle, THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE is a delightful lark of a film that wickedly spoofs the health fads of the early 1900s--and in particular those set forth by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg, co-inventor of the famous Kellogg cornflake and proponent of numerous "healthful" ideas that seem calculated to make moderns squirm. The film presents a triple story line. William and Eleanor Lightbody (Matthew Broderick and Bridget Fonda) are a young married couple in trouble: Eleanor has accidentally poisoned William and hopes a trip to Dr. Kellogg's sanatorium can set him right. Charles Ossining (John Cusack) has come to Battle Creek in the hope of striking it rich by creating a breakfast cereal to cash in on America's fitness craze--only to find himself involved with various thieves and scoundrels. These include George Kellogg (Dana Carvey), who seems to live to make the life of his adoptive father Dr. Kellogg (Anthony Hopkins) unmitigated hell. The various stories are extremely entertaining as they intertwine--but most of the laughs come at Dr. Kellogg's expense as he advocates yogurt enemas, electric baths, and other bizarre treatments that seem to arise primarily from his idea that sex "is the sewer drain of a healthy body." Patients are humiliated, harassed, and harangued about their sex lives even as they remain largely ignorant of their own sexual natures, which was typical of many Americans in this era. Much of it is crude, bad taste, bathroom humor--but it is expertly, hilariously handled. Any one who can sit through THE ROAD TO WELLVILLE without hooting out loud doesn't simply lack a sense of humor: they're probably dead. The performances are sharp, clever, and make the most of the various outlandish situations into the characters are forced. Broderick carries the film with tremendous charm and Fonda follows suit, but the real acting awards go to Anthony Hopkins, Dana Carvey, and a supporting cast that includes outrageously funny performances by the likes of Camryn Manheim, Traci Lind, Colm Meaney, and John Neville. The DVD has nothing in the way of bonus features and is, alas, only available in pan-and-scan, but don't let that stop you. Laugh your way to health the Kellogg way! GFT, Amazon Reviewer

    I have come to realize that my sense of humor is very much out of sync with mainstream film tastes. Frequently, I have seen a comedy that leaves me in hysterics, only to discover that it is loathed by the mainstream media and masses alike. "The Road To Wellville" is one of these films. When I first saw "The Road To Wellville" on Cinemax in the mid-nineties, I could not believe just how much crass and bawdy humor was packed into this film, and I could not stop laughing. Up to that time, I could not recall any other film so unashamedly filled with scatological references. I especially enjoyed the great Anthony Hopkins voicing the eccentric views of Dr. John Kellogg while defining a very strange but memorable character. Of course, the critics panned this film for the very reasons I initially loved it. Seeing it again, I can understand their revulsion. While the film is packed with many hilariously tasteless gags, the overall story is very erratic. The main plot involving Matthew Broderick's bizarre medical treatments is rather entertaining, but John Cusack's subplot is neither very funny nor well-written. By the three-quarters mark, the film loses momentum and becomes just another tedious romantic comedy. Such a shame, considering the outrageously satirical nature of the first few acts of this film. The laughs are there, but the story is not.
