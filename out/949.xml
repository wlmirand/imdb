  Finn is a young graduate student, finishing a master's thesis, and preparing for marriage to her fiance Sam. But thoughts of the end of the free life, and a potential summer fling, intrude.

    When writer Winona Ryder goes to visit her grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) who is living with her sister (Anne Bancroft), she becomes involved with the women who are part of an annual quilting bee. What she learns will not only help her in her own writing but in lessons she can teach the women who will come to her in her own future. This sweet and touching drama is the story of these group of women who help Ryder through a rough batch as she decides whether or not to return to her fianc&eacute; (Dermot Mulroney). Ryder learns each of these women's stories, usually involving the men in their life, and each of those tales surrounding their influence in their parts of the quilting will be an influence for her as she discovers her own destiny. The Oscar Winning Burstyn and Bancroft are gems together as sisters, facing their own past as Bancroft married the love of Burstyn's life and watched the two of them fall back together. In spite of that, the bond between the sisters never bended, and influenced Bancroft, a powerful artist in her own right, to use her anger in her art in creating a special wall. The dignified Maya Angelou tells of her aunt's own quilt, which surrounded the crow that lead her to the love of her life. Esther Rolle has a powerful cameo in flashback as this aunt. Angelou then tells how she fell in love with the young white boy who left her pregnant and how this brought her into the lives of Ryder's family. The sweet Jean Simmons gives a poignant performance telling Ryder of how her artist husband couldn't help his own infidelities and how she came to accept him for who he was, but how destiny has changed her own plans. Then, Alfre Woodard, as a spunky Haitan woman, tells of how she never allowed herself to become trapped by a man, something she sadly regrets but realized was beyond her control. Each of these women have something powerful to offer, but perhaps the most powerful of these characters is the former champion diver played by stage legend Lois Smith who is both feared and admired in the community and gets a great final scene to show how far she has come. A terrific ensemble in a lightly plotted drama shows that less can be more in creating terrific art.

    I really liked this film, the same way I like the idea of someone in trouble (Finn) going to her country home and there finding a suitable distraction, until she will make her mind around her problems. That distraction was of course the stories of the magnificent women of her grand-mom's quilt making beehive. One thing I didn't like though in the film was how self absorbed and immature the leading character is. I found my self at the end caring more about the secondary characters than Finn! One point in the film that shows how Finn really is as a character is when Sophia Darling brings her the lost pages from her thesis. There, Finn is so typical and indifferent that instantly drove me away from her. This is the only scene in the film where Sophia actually wants to say something personal, to open up, but Finn is actually rude. It's like she's saying to her: "OK, old lady. Thank you for bringing me the pages and telling me I am a good writer. However, this doesn't mean I have to pay attention in whatever you have the urge to say. Actually, I already know your bloody story and I find it just pathetic. Now buzz off and let me be!" I don't have to say that from all the stories, of the "quilting beehive women", I was both drawn and saddened the most by the one of Sophia. Life played her such an unfair game: She wanted to became a diver and so she asked her beau to help her get out of that small town. But, as it usually happens, he got her pregnant instead and she had to get married and having to spend a lot of time home alone being a housewife. That totally killed her spirit and passion and left her a bitter old woman that blamed her husband for her life going wrong. Her husband (finally) realized that and made some efforts to get back together. He did that by building her a pond, in order to remind her her old free self. However, that ironically ended it all, since it was too painful for her to remember how she was (comparing to what she is). That was the saddest thing, to Sophia, since building a pond for someone who loved to dive was ironically sad and showed such lack of understanding, that it was almost disrespectful. And so they argued. She did try to make amends but it was too late. Her husband, partly because of disappointed and partly because of quilt, left her. And something last: If you wanna "watch" more stories about americal quilts that hide really fascinating stories, then you must read the books in the Shenandoah Album by Emilie Richards. There are 5 books in this collection, all best sellers...

    I have watched parts of this movie more than once. The movie from start to finish only once. Each story unfolds like a facet on the quilt. Then as the main plot line draws to a conclusion, the thread that binds these stories together resolves each individual facet, to complete the whole. Quilting as I understand it, is bringing many contributions together to create a final product. Each little design tells a story and the master quilter put's these stories together , to convey a theme or message. I have not read the novel, but the movie conveys the message in it's title. The soundtrack is tranquil and adds to the mood. The interplay between Burstyn and Bancroft is a pleasure to watch. Winona is excellent.

    How to Make an American Quilt is a movie filled with excellent actors, and a so so storyline. Finn Dodd is spending the summer with her grandmother, great aunt and their quilting bee supposedly to finish her master's thesis, but in reality to think things over after her boyfriend proposes. Once she arrives she finds the quilting bee is making her a quilt based on their own experiences with love. We then go through the ritual flashbacks to learn that most of these women dealt with some kind of love related trauma in their pasts. Finn is also tempted by the local hunk and his abs before she ultimately decides whether she intends to get married to the boyfriend she left back in Berkeley. Burstyn, Bancroft, Angelou and Nelligan all do a splendid job, and Alfre Woodard deserves special notice simply because her flashback is the one variance in the movie and she does a lot with a small part. Ryder is very appealing as well. The weakness of the movie is Ryder's men. Both are very underdeveloped. Mulroney is just bland, while Schaech's character is completely defined by his well sculptured body. It is never clear why Finn makes the choice she does, and this is the ultimate weakness of the movie, along with the fairly predictable flashbacks showing the various ways these women have been wronged by men. However, the quilts shown throughout the film are just beautiful.

    The delight of the movie lies in the several stories, including the focal story of Finn herself. And what I'm struck by is how the quilt is a perfect metaphor for human life as it makes its way through the generations, particularly how women serve as the thread and fabric of life. First, think of the arts involving sewing or threading which you can look at as "connecting"and how they're almost universally performed by women. (You can tell me the human genome has nothing to say about gender behavior, and you can also tell me pigs can fly.) ...

    Near the beginning of the movie, Finn (played by Winona Ryder) offers this rather drab and depressing observation: "love sometimes dies." Well, sure - and I suppose most of us have been present at its death at some point in our lives, but I don't know that I want to have to be in on the autopsy afterward. Personally, as obviously true as the above statement from Finn may be, I'll still take 1 Corinthians 13:8 - "love never fails." It sounds so much more hopeful! As for this movie, it was just a dismal portrayal of love, marriage - and men, who generally come across here as rather unlovable, adulterous and shallow twits. Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Finn is a young college student writing a master's thesis who gets engaged and then promptly heads off to stay with her grandma and aunt and their friends for an entire summer while they make her wedding quilt. The movie revolves around the stories of the women's loves - and, for the most part, it ain't a happy story! They've all failed at love in one way or another (or, more usually, the men they loved failed them) and they end up getting poor Finn to the point of wanting to back out on her own wedding. From my perspective none of the performances here were particularly memorable (including Ryder's) and the characters not all that interesting or memorable. The movie ends with what appears to be some attempt at redemption, but you have to be able to stick with it long enough to get there, and then the redemption itself is a sort of qualified one as Finn ends her narration by essentially saying that she and her fianc&eacute; Sam might as well go through with this marriage thing because they have as much chance of succeeding as failing, and maybe their love will tip the scales ever so slightly on the "success" side of the scale. Isn't that heartwarming (or pathetic!) 2/10 (and I'm struggling to remember why I decided to go that high!)

    You don't come across a movie that tells so many stories that are so rich in emotion, as this one does. It is also refreshing to see that the emotions, and experiences depicted in this film, are not artificial, or a shadow of the true feelings that people harbour through the years. You find yourself both loving and hating the choices that Finn, and the many other women in the film have made. As a woman you are almost immediately attracted to her fianc&eacute;, Sam, who is level headed and unconditionally loving. He both compliments and evens out Finn's complex emotions and commitment phobia. Then there is Leon, the darkly sexy lover who seduces Finn and ultimately makes her realize how special Sam really is. It is not difficult to fall in love with the many characters and tales in this movie. From the tragic and beautiful tale of how Anna had her baby, Marie- Anna. Or the relationship between the aging artist and his ever loving wife. You also witness the unbreakable bond between sisters, and how it is sometimes easier to forgive than to bear a grudge. This film will always be a true chick flick classic, because it is both deep and simple. It has one message to give: Follow your heart.

    How To Make an American Quilt is a 1995 movie whose plot is based on a novel. I knew this heart-warming movie in an English discussion class of the University. I watched it over and over both with my classmate in the class and myself in my house. First time I watched it, I felt it was so slow. But I became very much to sympathize with the characters at the end of the semester, even though I knew it is a fictional movie. The main character, Finn is 26 years old. According to her, it is enough age to marry. She is engaged her boyfriend, Sam but she is not sure if he is the right person for her to spend the rest of her life. The idea of Finn is to take a time to think and escape her grandmother's house over the summer with a plausible excuse, for working on her master's thesis. The movie is not only focus on Finn but also on the stories of several women. They are "quilting bees" who make Finn's wedding quilt at the house of Finn's grandmother. During Finn stay the house, she is told and shares their story. One bad thing of this movie is that it is not for males because it is mostly about woman. And, no differ from other dramas, you need to watch not only one time but also several times to understand the real mean of this movie. I recommend you to watch it when you have a time. This is the movie I would like to watch again when I become 30's, 40's and later on. Even though, the story of "quilting bees" are heavy, it warms my heart! This touching movie is a true life of women.

    Women's own film about love and relationships, commitment and infidelity. Jane Anderson's script (from Whitney Otto's novel) tells of student Finn's sumer holiday with her grandmother and great Aunt, where she carefully considers boyfriend Sam's marriage proposal. Here she learns of the lives and loves of the members of the quilting bee that her grandma is part of. Jocelyn Moorhouse takes this project, a personal passion, to heart. She directs with purpose, giving the film a her own special touch. "American Quilt" meanders along as it tells of each woman's past, while Moorhouse ties it all up with a common theme. The pic only loses its way at the end with a dreadfully concocted, sentimental finale. An ensemble cast deliver some enjoyable performances, led by the fresh, attractive Winona Ryder, and supported by Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Kate Nelligan, Jean Simmons, Samantha Mathis, Lois Smith, Maya Angelou, Kate Capshaw, Melinda Dillon, Dermot Mulroney, Rip Torn, Derrick O'Connor and Loren Dean. Quite an assembly. Aussie director Moorhouse is backed up by compatriot editor Jill Bilcock ("Evil Angels"), who wields the knife astutely, while Janusz Kaminski ("Schindler's List") wields the camera with equal effect. Thomas Newman compliments the film with a pleasing score. Anderson and Moorhouse have focused the pic on the many choices women face, and the disappointments they have in relationships and matters of love. They fail to give the male players any depth, leaving them rather two dimensional. Story poses the question : How do we ever know if we've met the one person we should spend the rest of our lives with, or if we're ever meant to be with just one person at all? An answer though, is not provided, perhaps because, as this film seems to suggest, there is no one answer. Saturday, August 24, 1996 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema

    Filled with veterans, (Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Jean Simmons) recognizable character actors, (Rip Torn, Holland Taylor, Esther Rolle, Alfre Woodard), hot young adult stars (Winona Ryder, Dermot Mulroney, Samantha Mathis), some up-and-comers (Jared Leto, Claire Danes, Johnathon Schaech), and a poet (Maya Angelou), How to Make an American Quilt is an inspiring movie about a young college student staying during the summer at her aunt's house with many of that aunt's friends sewing a quilt while sharing memories of their young lives that provide material for the young woman's college paper. Based on a novel, this film provides detailed flashbacks of some of those lives and less so on others but they mostly provide some impetus for the aspiring author's decisions as she makes up her mind of what future she decides on. As a result of the constant flashbacks, some of what happens may be confusing but most gets explained at the end. So on that note, I recommend How to Make an American Quilt.

    When writer Winona Ryder goes to visit her grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) who is living with her sister (Anne Bancroft), she becomes involved with the women who are part of an annual quilting bee. What she learns will not only help her in her own writing but in lessons she can teach the women who will come to her in her own future.

Or the relationship between the aging artist and his ever loving wife. You also witness the unbreakable bond between sisters, and how it is sometimes easier to forgive than to bear a grudge. This film will always be a true chick flick classic, because it is both deep and simple. It has one message to give: Follow your heart.

    How To Make an American Quilt is a 1995 movie whose plot is based on a novel. I knew this heart-warming movie in an English discussion class of the University. I watched it over and over both with my classmate in the class and myself in my house. First time I watched it, I felt it was so slow. But I became very much to sympathize with the characters at the end of the semester, even though I knew it is a fictional movie. The main character, Finn is 26 years old. According to her, it is enough age to marry. She is engaged her boyfriend, Sam but she is not sure if he is the right person for her to spend the rest of her life. The idea of Finn is to take a time to think and escape her grandmother's house over the summer with a plausible excuse, for working on her master's thesis. The movie is not only focus on Finn but also on the stories of several women. They are "quilting bees" who make Finn's wedding quilt at the house of Finn's grandmother. During Finn stay the house, she is told and shares their story. One bad thing of this movie is that it is not for males because it is mostly about woman. And, no differ from other dramas, you need to watch not only one time but also several times to understand the real mean of this movie. I recommend you to watch it when you have a time. This is the movie I would like to watch again when I become 30's, 40's and later on. Even though, the story of "quilting bees" are heavy, it warms my heart! This touching movie is a true life of women.

    Women's own film about love and relationships, commitment and infidelity. Jane Anderson's script (from Whitney Otto's novel) tells of student Finn's sumer holiday with her grandmother and great Aunt, where she carefully considers boyfriend Sam's marriage proposal. Here she learns of the lives and loves of the members of the quilting bee that her grandma is part of. Jocelyn Moorhouse takes this project, a personal passion, to heart. She directs with purpose, giving the film a her own special touch. "American Quilt" meanders along as it tells of each woman's past, while Moorhouse ties it all up with a common theme. The pic only loses its way at the end with a dreadfully concocted, sentimental finale. An ensemble cast deliver some enjoyable performances, led by the fresh, attractive Winona Ryder, and supported by Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Kate Nelligan, Jean Simmons, Samantha Mathis, Lois Smith, Maya Angelou, Kate Capshaw, Melinda Dillon, Dermot Mulroney, Rip Torn, Derrick O'Connor and Loren Dean. Quite an assembly. Aussie director Moorhouse is backed up by compatriot editor Jill Bilcock ("Evil Angels"), who wields the knife astutely, while Janusz Kaminski ("Schindler's List") wields the camera with equal effect. Thomas Newman compliments the film with a pleasing score. Anderson and Moorhouse have focused the pic on the many choices women face, and the disappointments they have in relationships and matters of love. They fail to give the male players any depth, leaving them rather two dimensional. Story poses the question : How do we ever know if we've met the one person we should spend the rest of our lives with, or if we're ever meant to be with just one person at all? An answer though, is not provided, perhaps because, as this film seems to suggest, there is no one answer. Saturday, August 24, 1996 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema

    Filled with veterans, (Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Jean Simmons) recognizable character actors, (Rip Torn, Holland Taylor, Esther Rolle, Alfre Woodard), hot young adult stars (Winona Ryder, Dermot Mulroney, Samantha Mathis), some up-and-comers (Jared Leto, Claire Danes, Johnathon Schaech), and a poet (Maya Angelou), How to Make an American Quilt is an inspiring movie about a young college student staying during the summer at her aunt's house with many of that aunt's friends sewing a quilt while sharing memories of their young lives that provide material for the young woman's college paper. Based on a novel, this film provides detailed flashbacks of some of those lives and less so on others but they mostly provide some impetus for the aspiring author's decisions as she makes up her mind of what future she decides on. As a result of the constant flashbacks, some of what happens may be confusing but most gets explained at the end. So on that note, I recommend How to Make an American Quilt.

    When writer Winona Ryder goes to visit her grandmother (Ellen Burstyn) who is living with her sister (Anne Bancroft), she becomes involved with the women who are part of an annual quilting bee. What she learns will not only help her in her own writing but in lessons she can teach the women who will come to her in her own future. This sweet and touching drama is the story of these group of women who help Ryder through a rough batch as she decides whether or not to return to her fianc&eacute; (Dermot Mulroney). Ryder learns each of these women's stories, usually involving the men in their life, and each of those tales surrounding their influence in their parts of the quilting will be an influence for her as she discovers her own destiny. The Oscar Winning Burstyn and Bancroft are gems together as sisters, facing their own past as Bancroft married the love of Burstyn's life and watched the two of them fall back together. In spite of that, the bond between the sisters never bended, and influenced Bancroft, a powerful artist in her own right, to use her anger in her art in creating a special wall. The dignified Maya Angelou tells of her aunt's own quilt, which surrounded the crow that lead her to the love of her life. Esther Rolle has a powerful cameo in flashback as this aunt. Angelou then tells how she fell in love with the young white boy who left her pregnant and how this brought her into the lives of Ryder's family. The sweet Jean Simmons gives a poignant performance telling Ryder of how her artist husband couldn't help his own infidelities and how she came to accept him for who he was, but how destiny has changed her own plans. Then, Alfre Woodard, as a spunky Haitan woman, tells of how she never allowed herself to become trapped by a man, something she sadly regrets but realized was beyond her control. Each of these women have something powerful to offer, but perhaps the most powerful of these characters is the former champion diver played by stage legend Lois Smith who is both feared and admired in the community and gets a great final scene to show how far she has come. A terrific ensemble in a lightly plotted drama shows that less can be more in creating terrific art.

    I really liked this film, the same way I like the idea of someone in trouble (Finn) going to her country home and there finding a suitable distraction, until she will make her mind around her problems. That distraction was of course the stories of the magnificent women of her grand-mom's quilt making beehive. One thing I didn't like though in the film was how self absorbed and immature the leading character is. I found my self at the end caring more about the secondary characters than Finn! One point in the film that shows how Finn really is as a character is when Sophia Darling brings her the lost pages from her thesis. There, Finn is so typical and indifferent that instantly drove me away from her. This is the only scene in the film where Sophia actually wants to say something personal, to open up, but Finn is actually rude. It's like she's saying to her: "OK, old lady. Thank you for bringing me the pages and telling me I am a good writer. However, this doesn't mean I have to pay attention in whatever you have the urge to say. Actually, I already know your bloody story and I find it just pathetic. Now buzz off and let me be!" I don't have to say that from all the stories, of the "quilting beehive women", I was both drawn and saddened the most by the one of Sophia. Life played her such an unfair game: She wanted to became a diver and so she asked her beau to help her get out of that small town. But, as it usually happens, he got her pregnant instead and she had to get married and having to spend a lot of time home alone being a housewife. That totally killed her spirit and passion and left her a bitter old woman that blamed her husband for her life going wrong. Her husband (finally) realized that and made some efforts to get back together. He did that by building her a pond, in order to remind her her old free self. However, that ironically ended it all, since it was too painful for her to remember how she was (comparing to what she is). That was the saddest thing, to Sophia, since building a pond for someone who loved to dive was ironically sad and showed such lack of understanding, that it was almost disrespectful. And so they argued. She did try to make amends but it was too late. Her husband, partly because of disappointed and partly because of quilt, left her. And something last: If you wanna "watch" more stories about americal quilts that hide really fascinating stories, then you must read the books in the Shenandoah Album by Emilie Richards. There are 5 books in this collection, all best sellers...

    I have watched parts of this movie more than once. The movie from start to finish only once. Each story unfolds like a facet on the quilt. Then as the main plot line draws to a conclusion, the thread that binds these stories together resolves each individual facet, to complete the whole. Quilting as I understand it, is bringing many contributions together to create a final product. Each little design tells a story and the master quilter put's these stories together , to convey a theme or message. I have not read the novel, but the movie conveys the message in it's title. The soundtrack is tranquil and adds to the mood. The interplay between Burstyn and Bancroft is a pleasure to watch. Winona is excellent.

    How to Make an American Quilt is a movie filled with excellent actors, and a so so storyline. Finn Dodd is spending the summer with her grandmother, great aunt and their quilting bee supposedly to finish her master's thesis, but in reality to think things over after her boyfriend proposes. Once she arrives she finds the quilting bee is making her a quilt based on their own experiences with love. We then go through the ritual flashbacks to learn that most of these women dealt with some kind of love related trauma in their pasts. Finn is also tempted by the local hunk and his abs before she ultimately decides whether she intends to get married to the boyfriend she left back in Berkeley. Burstyn, Bancroft, Angelou and Nelligan all do a splendid job, and Alfre Woodard deserves special notice simply because her flashback is the one variance in the movie and she does a lot with a small part. Ryder is very appealing as well. The weakness of the movie is Ryder's men. Both are very underdeveloped. Mulroney is just bland, while Schaech's character is completely defined by his well sculptured body. It is never clear why Finn makes the choice she does, and this is the ultimate weakness of the movie, along with the fairly predictable flashbacks showing the various ways these women have been wronged by men. However, the quilts shown throughout the film are just beautiful.

    The delight of the movie lies in the several stories, including the focal story of Finn herself. And what I'm struck by is how the quilt is a perfect metaphor for human life as it makes its way through the generations, particularly how women serve as the thread and fabric of life. First, think of the arts involving sewing or threading which you can look at as "connecting"and how they're almost universally performed by women. (You can tell me the human genome has nothing to say about gender behavior, and you can also tell me pigs can fly.) ...

    Near the beginning of the movie, Finn (played by Winona Ryder) offers this rather drab and depressing observation: "love sometimes dies." Well, sure - and I suppose most of us have been present at its death at some point in our lives, but I don't know that I want to have to be in on the autopsy afterward. Personally, as obviously true as the above statement from Finn may be, I'll still take 1 Corinthians 13:8 - "love never fails." It sounds so much more hopeful! As for this movie, it was just a dismal portrayal of love, marriage - and men, who generally come across here as rather unlovable, adulterous and shallow twits. Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Finn is a young college student writing a master's thesis who gets engaged and then promptly heads off to stay with her grandma and aunt and their friends for an entire summer while they make her wedding quilt. The movie revolves around the stories of the women's loves - and, for the most part, it ain't a happy story! They've all failed at love in one way or another (or, more usually, the men they loved failed them) and they end up getting poor Finn to the point of wanting to back out on her own wedding. From my perspective none of the performances here were particularly memorable (including Ryder's) and the characters not all that interesting or memorable. The movie ends with what appears to be some attempt at redemption, but you have to be able to stick with it long enough to get there, and then the redemption itself is a sort of qualified one as Finn ends her narration by essentially saying that she and her fianc&eacute; Sam might as well go through with this marriage thing because they have as much chance of succeeding as failing, and maybe their love will tip the scales ever so slightly on the "success" side of the scale. Isn't that heartwarming (or pathetic!) 2/10 (and I'm struggling to remember why I decided to go that high!)

    You don't come across a movie that tells so many stories that are so rich in emotion, as this one does. It is also refreshing to see that the emotions, and experiences depicted in this film, are not artificial, or a shadow of the true feelings that people harbour through the years. You find yourself both loving and hating the choices that Finn, and the many other women in the film have made. As a woman you are almost immediately attracted to her fianc&eacute;, Sam, who is level headed and unconditionally loving. He both compliments and evens out Finn's complex emotions and commitment phobia. Then there is Leon, the darkly sexy lover who seduces Finn and ultimately makes her realize how special Sam really is. It is not difficult to fall in love with the many characters and tales in this movie. From the tragic and beautiful tale of how Anna had her baby, Marie- Anna. Or the relationship between the aging artist and his ever loving wife. You also witness the unbreakable bond between sisters, and how it is sometimes easier to forgive than to bear a grudge. This film will always be a true chick flick classic, because it is both deep and simple. It has one message to give: Follow your heart.

First, think of the arts involving sewing or threading which you can look at as "connecting"and how they're almost universally performed by women. (You can tell me the human genome has nothing to say about gender behavior, and you can also tell me pigs can fly.) ...

    Near the beginning of the movie, Finn (played by Winona Ryder) offers this rather drab and depressing observation: "love sometimes dies." Well, sure - and I suppose most of us have been present at its death at some point in our lives, but I don't know that I want to have to be in on the autopsy afterward. Personally, as obviously true as the above statement from Finn may be, I'll still take 1 Corinthians 13:8 - "love never fails." It sounds so much more hopeful! As for this movie, it was just a dismal portrayal of love, marriage - and men, who generally come across here as rather unlovable, adulterous and shallow twits. Much of the movie is told in flashbacks. Finn is a young college student writing a master's thesis who gets engaged and then promptly heads off to stay with her grandma and aunt and their friends for an entire summer while they make her wedding quilt. The movie revolves around the stories of the women's loves - and, for the most part, it ain't a happy story! They've all failed at love in one way or another (or, more usually, the men they loved failed them) and they end up getting poor Finn to the point of wanting to back out on her own wedding. From my perspective none of the performances here were particularly memorable (including Ryder's) and the characters not all that interesting or memorable. The movie ends with what appears to be some attempt at redemption, but you have to be able to stick with it long enough to get there, and then the redemption itself is a sort of qualified one as Finn ends her narration by essentially saying that she and her fianc&eacute; Sam might as well go through with this marriage thing because they have as much chance of succeeding as failing, and maybe their love will tip the scales ever so slightly on the "success" side of the scale. Isn't that heartwarming (or pathetic!) 2/10 (and I'm struggling to remember why I decided to go that high!)

    You don't come across a movie that tells so many stories that are so rich in emotion, as this one does. It is also refreshing to see that the emotions, and experiences depicted in this film, are not artificial, or a shadow of the true feelings that people harbour through the years. You find yourself both loving and hating the choices that Finn, and the many other women in the film have made. As a woman you are almost immediately attracted to her fianc&eacute;, Sam, who is level headed and unconditionally loving. He both compliments and evens out Finn's complex emotions and commitment phobia. Then there is Leon, the darkly sexy lover who seduces Finn and ultimately makes her realize how special Sam really is. It is not difficult to fall in love with the many characters and tales in this movie. From the tragic and beautiful tale of how Anna had her baby, Marie- Anna. Or the relationship between the aging artist and his ever loving wife. You also witness the unbreakable bond between sisters, and how it is sometimes easier to forgive than to bear a grudge. This film will always be a true chick flick classic, because it is both deep and simple. It has one message to give: Follow your heart.

    How To Make an American Quilt is a 1995 movie whose plot is based on a novel. I knew this heart-warming movie in an English discussion class of the University. I watched it over and over both with my classmate in the class and myself in my house. First time I watched it, I felt it was so slow. But I became very much to sympathize with the characters at the end of the semester, even though I knew it is a fictional movie. The main character, Finn is 26 years old. According to her, it is enough age to marry. She is engaged her boyfriend, Sam but she is not sure if he is the right person for her to spend the rest of her life. The idea of Finn is to take a time to think and escape her grandmother's house over the summer with a plausible excuse, for working on her master's thesis. The movie is not only focus on Finn but also on the stories of several women. They are "quilting bees" who make Finn's wedding quilt at the house of Finn's grandmother. During Finn stay the house, she is told and shares their story. One bad thing of this movie is that it is not for males because it is mostly about woman. And, no differ from other dramas, you need to watch not only one time but also several times to understand the real mean of this movie. I recommend you to watch it when you have a time. This is the movie I would like to watch again when I become 30's, 40's and later on. Even though, the story of "quilting bees" are heavy, it warms my heart! This touching movie is a true life of women.

    Women's own film about love and relationships, commitment and infidelity. Jane Anderson's script (from Whitney Otto's novel) tells of student Finn's sumer holiday with her grandmother and great Aunt, where she carefully considers boyfriend Sam's marriage proposal. Here she learns of the lives and loves of the members of the quilting bee that her grandma is part of. Jocelyn Moorhouse takes this project, a personal passion, to heart. She directs with purpose, giving the film a her own special touch. "American Quilt" meanders along as it tells of each woman's past, while Moorhouse ties it all up with a common theme. The pic only loses its way at the end with a dreadfully concocted, sentimental finale. An ensemble cast deliver some enjoyable performances, led by the fresh, attractive Winona Ryder, and supported by Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Kate Nelligan, Jean Simmons, Samantha Mathis, Lois Smith, Maya Angelou, Kate Capshaw, Melinda Dillon, Dermot Mulroney, Rip Torn, Derrick O'Connor and Loren Dean. Quite an assembly. Aussie director Moorhouse is backed up by compatriot editor Jill Bilcock ("Evil Angels"), who wields the knife astutely, while Janusz Kaminski ("Schindler's List") wields the camera with equal effect. Thomas Newman compliments the film with a pleasing score. Anderson and Moorhouse have focused the pic on the many choices women face, and the disappointments they have in relationships and matters of love. They fail to give the male players any depth, leaving them rather two dimensional. Story poses the question : How do we ever know if we've met the one person we should spend the rest of our lives with, or if we're ever meant to be with just one person at all? An answer though, is not provided, perhaps because, as this film seems to suggest, there is no one answer. Saturday, August 24, 1996 - Waverley Pinewood Cinema

    Filled with veterans, (Ellen Burstyn, Anne Bancroft, Jean Simmons) recognizable character actors, (Rip Torn, Holland Taylor, Esther Rolle, Alfre Woodard), hot young adult stars (Winona Ryder, Dermot Mulroney, Samantha Mathis), some up-and-comers (Jared Leto, Claire Danes, Johnathon Schaech), and a poet (Maya Angelou), How to Make an American Quilt is an inspiring movie about a young college student staying during the summer at her aunt's house with many of that aunt's friends sewing a quilt while sharing memories of their young lives that provide material for the young woman's college paper. Based on a novel, this film provides detailed flashbacks of some of those lives and less so on others but they mostly provide some impetus for the aspiring author's decisions as she makes up her mind of what future she decides on. As a result of the constant flashbacks, some of what happens may be confusing but most gets explained at the end. So on that note, I recommend How to Make an American Quilt.
