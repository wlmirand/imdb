    Actor Mario Van Peebles plays a cyborg warrior with a conscience in "Blue Tiger" director Norberto Barba's new science fiction thriller "Solo." This ballistically paced testosterone thriller recycles familiar plot elements from movies such as "Universal Soldier" (1992), "Rambo: First Blood, Part II," and the western classic "The Magnificent Seven." Although "Solo" appears initially as little more than a derivative African-American android opus, Barba has cleverly woven some traditional philosophical ideas about appropriate human behavior into this violent melodrama that go beyond its cinematic pyrotechnics. "Solo" opens aboard a U.S. spy trawler off the coast of an unidentified Latin American country. Army General Clyde Haynes (Barry Corbin of "My Science Project") introduces Solo, a $2-billion bionic soldier prototype designed as the ideal military killing machine. According to Haynes, Solo has no feelings and is ultimately disposable. Furthermore, Solo comes equipped with bullet proof skin, infrared vision, and the amazing ability to intercept radio messages during transmission. Despite his formidable arsenal, Solo has been programmed with conflicting commands by its designer, Dr. Bill Stewart (Adrien Brody of "Splice") has failed to tweak before the cyborg is sent into battle. Colonel Madden (William Sadler of "Die Hard 2: Dead Harder"), a battle-seasoned adrenalin junkie, heads up a commando team dispatched to destroy an airfield that rebel guerrillas are constructing. The Americans slip in under the cover of darkness, and Solo plants the explosives to blow up the airfield. While he is setting up the explosives, Solo scans the area with his infrared vision and spots several noncombatants being used as slave labor. Because these civilians may die from the blast, Solo's command directives prevent him from following orders. When the android decides to defuse the explosives, Madden triggers the remaining charges. Explosions and machine-gun fire erupt, and the Americans scramble for their helicopters, deliberately abandoning their robotic warrior. Solo receives a messianic wound low on his left side that fires his power management chip. But that doesn't keep our super-soldier protagonist from grabbing onto one of the choppers as it lifts off. Back aboard the trawler, Stewart removes the damaged chip. He explains to Solo that the android must switch over to back-up power until the chip can be replaced. This make the super-soldier just a little less invincible. Meanwhile, a furious Haynes and a vindictive Madden demand to know why Solo refused to obey orders. Stewart explains that a glitch occurred when Solo tried to resolve a discrepancy in his command menu. Madden wants to shut Solo down, but Haynes decides to salvage their expensive prototype. Solo intercepts the outgoing transmission and learns that Haynes wants him reprogrammed. Solo consults his menu of functions and learn that his prime directive is self-preservation. Before "Solo" fades to black, our android hero learns that to act selfishly may be logical but is not appropriate human behavior. Solo steals a helicopter and flies off to the mainland. Madden chases him and watches as Solo crashes into a mountain. When Madden sifts through the wreckage, he cannot find a trace of the wily cyborg. Solo managed to survive the crash and has vanished into the bowels of the jungle.. A small boy from the village discovers Solo resting in an underground temple and nearly gets bitten when a snake attacks him. Solo goes on line on the spur of the moments and grabs the snake before its venomous fangs sink into the vulnerable child. Horrified, the lad runs back to his village, but later returns with his father and the rest of the village. When they find the considerably run-down Solo, they believe at first that he is dead. The little boy demands they give him a proper burial. At the church, he bad guy rebels storm in, interrupting the burial ritual, and shoot up the church. Solo springs into action and single-handedly wipes them out. The villagers reveal that the rebels were forcing them under threat of death to clear an airstrip. Solo agrees to teach the farmers how to fight if they will allow him to use parts from an old black and white, portable television to recharge himself. At this point, Peebles emerges as "The Magnificent Seven" stacked into one. They arrange elaborate traps around the village, and Solo shows them how to use bows and arrows to lethal effect. When the rebels return, the villagers give them a reception that throws them off-balance. Back aboard the trawler, surveillance devices warn them about a battle raging in the jungle. Haynes orders Colonel Madden to lead in an elite unit of hand-picked mercenaries to recover Solo. Madden secretly wants to destroy the prototype. If Solo performs well under fire, Madden fears that similar prototypes may eventually replace career soldiers like him. He believes that his men can kill Solo because the android is not only vulnerable but heavily damaged. Once he reaches the mainland, Madden cuts a deal with the slimy rebels to ice Solo. First, Madden fakes evidence so it appears that Solo has gone crazy and torched the village. The Colonel broadcasts deceptive images of a burning hut back to Haynes aboard the trawler and he swallows the lie. As bait to lure Solo out, Madden persuades Haynes to send in Stewart, who learns too late that Madden duped him. Solo manages to rescue his creator in a way that would make Indiana Jones envious. But Stewart is fatally wounded during the escape. "I should never have left college," Stewart laments and hands Solo a rebuilt power chip before he dies. To divulge any other details about the story would undercut the entertainment value of the movie. "Solo" breaks no new ground for this specific type of character or adventure film, but Narba stages the action well. Most audiences have seen everything that Solo eventually learns, especially if they've kept track of Mr. Spock's progress over the years in the original "Star Trek" movies. If you enjoy fast-moving, well-crafted actioneers, "Solo" is worth watching once.

    This little b-grade straight-to-video action joint won't win any awards for it has been done to death, but for what it is it made for a passable outing despite the predictable formulaic nature of the story, silly occurrences and mechanical action set-pieces. "Solo" actually had I thinking of Paul W. S. Anderson's big budgeted "Soldier" that came out two years later. The two surprisingly had some similarities just that "Solo" were set in modern times and in the humid jungle terrain, compared to the futuristic backdrop for "Soldier" which was much more expansive across the board. The basic plot is almost identical. Even a sequence involving a poisonous snake. While the screenplay for "Solo", is actually adapted off Robert Mason's novel "Weapon" and has shades of "Universal Soldier". Solo is cyborg that was created to be the perfect killing machine, but it disobeys an order when it meant killing innocent civilians. The army isn't particularly happy with it, so it plans to re-create it. But before doing that Solo escapes in to the South American jungle. There he helps out a small, poor village that are terrorised by rebel soldiers by providing them fighting spirit. But to top that off the Americans want their creation back, so a small elite group is sent in to get him back. Director Norberto Barba's handling for most part is rushed and lacklustre, where by hiding it with jaded editing and its techno special effects. Still it has some gusto in its climatic exchanges, especially in the one that comes from nowhere that sees two androids colliding. Don't try to compute the script either, sometimes sappy in its emotional details but never does it go beyond its comic-book approach. Mario Van Pebbles is surprisingly convincing, embodying that steely approach but also showing cracks of humane qualities (trying to understand the meaning of a bluff/joke and freaking you out with his cackling). Quite old-hat in the character portrayal, but well done. Having fun William Sadler provides the psychotic edge, as an army Colonel who disapproves of the Solo creation and would do anything to see it fail. "First rule of dealing with the devil. Don't". Going gawky is Adrien Brody as Solo's creator and Barry Corbin is the General in charge of the project. Soulless, but reliable entertainment. "When you hunt a fox, bring your own dogs".

    First off- a quote from the film: Solo: My brain isn't in my head. It's in here Girl: If your brain is in your chest, where is your heart? Solo: I don't have one. I'm beginning to become like a dowsing rod for a bad film. Either that or I'm just watching films that come on Channel 5 more often. I kept seeing ads for Solo and just got that feeling that it would be worth watching, as 1) Mario Van Peebles is crap and 2) It was on Channel 5. Van Peebles is a cyborg built by the military to waste folk. Trouble is he's got a design fault that makes him NOT kill people. Doh. So they decide to get rid of him but he picks up the message to suspend the project (how I'm not sure - he just sort of looks up at a wall), so he jumps ship and heads for a South American village, which is naturally being bullied by rebels or drug dealers or something. I'm not to sure what they are, but be assured the village is full of stereotypes for Solo to interact with. The military sends out Sadler to kick Solo's ass, but Sadler is nuts and seems to shoot people just for the sake of it. Meanwhile Solo is teaching the locals how to fight, as being a computer type allows him to translate Spanish, but then the film forgets and everyone just talks English or something. This film is a mish-mash of Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminator. It's also very very stupid and unintentionally funny. I loved the love interest, even though he's a robot. Or many of the inexplicable moments that are never explained, like how Solo just appears in a pool of water, how he jumps up onto a helicopter, or how connecting himself up to a generator charges him up. There's very little violence until the end, when everyone gets wasted. Sadler gets his back broke and then reappears as a cyborg! The word 'illogical' is overused by Solo in his attempts to be more human, and the scene where he's being taught what a joke his had me cringing. Are Van Damme films as bad as this? If they are, I might give them a go.

    I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?! I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. Robots cant bluff... PSYCHE! I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!

    Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast. Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well. Solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

    An independent action sci-fi (The danger alert !) + Mario Van Peebles (Not my star or even close !) + A story about human android (Terminator-Peter Weller-I'll Be Back kind of crap.. NAAAY !) = The early healthy sleep is surely much better ! Though as funny as it may seem (for me mainly) I liked it very much as dexterous action movie or as good story with a lot of important potentials. (Solo) is the electronic super soldier who got human and became more sensitive than all the senseless war machines around him whom ironically are the original humans! It's Frankenstein again but in Schwarzenegger's kind of shape with the conflict of the little village and its protector "one" samurai against his crazy makers ! I just want to assure how catchy the elements of the story were, which made me confused about how the big Hollywood majors missed that one ?! I couldn't believe the presence of so many good things since my experience with familiar low budget flicks was horrible. For instance : The script. Actually they could have recreated Frankenstein who takes revenge cruelly on its makers, but on the contrary we've watched the (human/beast) conflict and how (Solo) personifies  by his muddle newborn humanity  the noble martyr of this inferno or that greedy degenerate human world. Also how it was wonderful to begin hotly enough with the point of attack when (Solo) the robot uses his own merciful tactic, then we watch his past briefly and smartly after. Moreover the nice touches to affirm his importunate desire to be human (the childish wicked tricks, the joy of the smile, the meaning of sacrifice.. etc), and the idea of another electronic more lethal soldier at the end was unpredictable along with expressing as we watch the ultimate confrontation where the heartless American military commander turned perfectly into that mighty monstrosity against the android where the android looked more high and powerful because of what he already learned from the pure human souls. And although the android triumphed eventually, but the sole (solo) must die at the end as the only one there who is deadly and "kind" in the same time, so he couldn't live by the deranged logic of this world, yet his death informed about how the human could win the beast humanly ! That final truthful laugh was such a marvelous end which summarized the main victory of (Solo) and the basic tragic sense of the whole thing (maybe that's what Hollywood hated in this story). The direction wasn't that vapid or that Kubrick either. It made fair action despite the non-zillion budget. Then we come to the matter of (Mario Van Peebles); regardless of the ordinary charisma and the quiet career which both didn't serve him much; this actor confirms here how talented he is. His performance grasped the subtle features of Solo's personality even if it seemed so easy to act. This man, as a true actor, gave a lucid effort to show us (Solo), not as another metallic character done by metallic star; he put some simple human sense in the mix to watch carefully how (Solo) the machine feels the pain of not feeling, to experience the confusion of the human games, and to taste his unfortunate mineral laughter (That was his best scene). (Peebles) succeeded in playing (Solo) clemently; by putting slight doleful compassion with strong pride right in his eyes, voice and moves. Maybe I didn't like that stereotyped forever-evil guy; not because its bad conscience, but for its bad construction, where he was so devilish with no convincing reason or whatsoever ! But anyway, (Solo) is solid piece of work that made such a new Frankenstein, mixed it cleverly with the one-man-army action hero, and while presenting the story of the monster; didn't turn into one itself !

    Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them is a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful. The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one clich&eacute; after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really. Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really. Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films. Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

    Even the most precursory glance at his extensive film work, clearly shows that Mario Van Peebles has sadly never really made it as big in Hollywood as he deserves. Up until now for instance, his most well known roles have been the (enjoyably OTT) sorcerer Kane in Highlander 3 and as effective fish chow in the utterly risible Jaws: The Revenge. The majority of his work tends to have been low key, direct to video fodder which is a real shame, as in my opinion, Peebles is a decent actor with a lot of unfulfilled potential. For instance, I know not whether he ever auditioned for the part, but I would be willing to bet that Peebles would have made a much better Blade than Wesley 'Pay my taxes?!!!' Snipes. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the film reviewed here is hardly likely to help Peebles career any either. In fact, I am slightly puzzled as to why he would have ever taken such a role in the first place (the money was good perhaps?) Peebles plays the eponymous hero of the title  a state of the art, cybernetic weapon who it turns out is struggling with the contradictory nature of the callus orders given unto him by his superiors. On one such mission Solo deliberately sabotages the objective in order to spare some innocent civilians, much to the anger of his commanders who subsequently order him to be decommissioned. However, getting wind of this, Solo decides that self preservation is of the highest order and goes on the run, hotly pursued by a relentless, sadistic colonel (the ever superb William Sadler) who has a particular grudge against what Solo represents. Ending up in a small South American village, Solo is gradually befriended by the locals and begins to learn the nature of humanity. In addition, he serves as their protector from a ruthless gang of bandits. Of course, things don't stay happy for long and the army eventually locate him whereupon much explosive action ensues. Finally, Solo discovers that he is in fact not the only one of his kind when another android is sent to destroy him. Needless to say, there can be only one winner.. Once again, I do wonder why Peebles chose to play such a role; As a guide, if you've ever watched (the gorgeous!) Jerry Ryan in Star Trek: Voyager as Seven Of Nine, then you'll be able to clearly picture exactly how Peebles plays his part. Certainly, the role hardly pushes him as an actor in any way. On the other hand, Peebles did work himself into awesome physical shape for the role and apparently undertook some arduous military/combative style training regimes in order to capture the action authentically (although it has to be said that said scenes have not been exactly well handled by the director here). Whilst Peebles may not get to display at least his acting muscles, as mentioned before, Sadler is excellent as the psychopathic Colonal and it's also great to see an early role here from none other than Adrian Brody of The Pianist fame. At the end of the day, if approached in the right frame of mind, this proves to be a fairly enjoyable, if low key flick, albeit one that seems to take itself perhaps a little too seriously for my liking. Nonetheless, for less discriminating action junkies and fans of the whole android sub genre, this is a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half.

    I just watched "Solo", and I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, I'm not an action movie aficionado, so I have no preconceived preferences for Arnie, Sly, etc. I simply found the movie an enjoyable, maybe mindless, hour-and-a-half. Mario van Peebles did his best to present himself as a cyborg with human tendencies. Barry Corbin is always enjoyable when in his Maurice Minnifield persona. Adrien Brody is wonderfully emotive as the scientist who cares about his creation. My only question, after watching the movie, is how Solo continues to survive without anyone to repair his power management chip.

    Although the robot has "Terminator"-like vision, the filmmakers do not. Mario Van Peebles is a robot. The robot escaped from the military facility that constructed it a la "Short Circuit". The robot booby-traps a village a la "Home Alone". The robot also wishes to look like Michael Jordan. After 80 minutes, the robot learns a valuable lesson about the preciousness of human life which enables him to force monotone laughter through his mechanical voice box. (I gave it a five because it's THAT absurd) These are not exaggerations. This is what you're in for.

If Solo performs well under fire, Madden fears that similar prototypes may eventually replace career soldiers like him. He believes that his men can kill Solo because the android is not only vulnerable but heavily damaged. Once he reaches the mainland, Madden cuts a deal with the slimy rebels to ice Solo. First, Madden fakes evidence so it appears that Solo has gone crazy and torched the village. The Colonel broadcasts deceptive images of a burning hut back to Haynes aboard the trawler and he swallows the lie. As bait to lure Solo out, Madden persuades Haynes to send in Stewart, who learns too late that Madden duped him. Solo manages to rescue his creator in a way that would make Indiana Jones envious. But Stewart is fatally wounded during the escape. "I should never have left college," Stewart laments and hands Solo a rebuilt power chip before he dies. To divulge any other details about the story would undercut the entertainment value of the movie. "Solo" breaks no new ground for this specific type of character or adventure film, but Narba stages the action well. Most audiences have seen everything that Solo eventually learns, especially if they've kept track of Mr. Spock's progress over the years in the original "Star Trek" movies. If you enjoy fast-moving, well-crafted actioneers, "Solo" is worth watching once.

    This little b-grade straight-to-video action joint won't win any awards for it has been done to death, but for what it is it made for a passable outing despite the predictable formulaic nature of the story, silly occurrences and mechanical action set-pieces. "Solo" actually had I thinking of Paul W. S. Anderson's big budgeted "Soldier" that came out two years later. The two surprisingly had some similarities just that "Solo" were set in modern times and in the humid jungle terrain, compared to the futuristic backdrop for "Soldier" which was much more expansive across the board. The basic plot is almost identical. Even a sequence involving a poisonous snake. While the screenplay for "Solo", is actually adapted off Robert Mason's novel "Weapon" and has shades of "Universal Soldier". Solo is cyborg that was created to be the perfect killing machine, but it disobeys an order when it meant killing innocent civilians. The army isn't particularly happy with it, so it plans to re-create it. But before doing that Solo escapes in to the South American jungle. There he helps out a small, poor village that are terrorised by rebel soldiers by providing them fighting spirit. But to top that off the Americans want their creation back, so a small elite group is sent in to get him back. Director Norberto Barba's handling for most part is rushed and lacklustre, where by hiding it with jaded editing and its techno special effects. Still it has some gusto in its climatic exchanges, especially in the one that comes from nowhere that sees two androids colliding. Don't try to compute the script either, sometimes sappy in its emotional details but never does it go beyond its comic-book approach. Mario Van Pebbles is surprisingly convincing, embodying that steely approach but also showing cracks of humane qualities (trying to understand the meaning of a bluff/joke and freaking you out with his cackling). Quite old-hat in the character portrayal, but well done. Having fun William Sadler provides the psychotic edge, as an army Colonel who disapproves of the Solo creation and would do anything to see it fail. "First rule of dealing with the devil. Don't". Going gawky is Adrien Brody as Solo's creator and Barry Corbin is the General in charge of the project. Soulless, but reliable entertainment. "When you hunt a fox, bring your own dogs".

    First off- a quote from the film: Solo: My brain isn't in my head. It's in here Girl: If your brain is in your chest, where is your heart? Solo: I don't have one. I'm beginning to become like a dowsing rod for a bad film. Either that or I'm just watching films that come on Channel 5 more often. I kept seeing ads for Solo and just got that feeling that it would be worth watching, as 1) Mario Van Peebles is crap and 2) It was on Channel 5. Van Peebles is a cyborg built by the military to waste folk. Trouble is he's got a design fault that makes him NOT kill people. Doh. So they decide to get rid of him but he picks up the message to suspend the project (how I'm not sure - he just sort of looks up at a wall), so he jumps ship and heads for a South American village, which is naturally being bullied by rebels or drug dealers or something. I'm not to sure what they are, but be assured the village is full of stereotypes for Solo to interact with. The military sends out Sadler to kick Solo's ass, but Sadler is nuts and seems to shoot people just for the sake of it. Meanwhile Solo is teaching the locals how to fight, as being a computer type allows him to translate Spanish, but then the film forgets and everyone just talks English or something. This film is a mish-mash of Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminator. It's also very very stupid and unintentionally funny. I loved the love interest, even though he's a robot. Or many of the inexplicable moments that are never explained, like how Solo just appears in a pool of water, how he jumps up onto a helicopter, or how connecting himself up to a generator charges him up. There's very little violence until the end, when everyone gets wasted. Sadler gets his back broke and then reappears as a cyborg! The word 'illogical' is overused by Solo in his attempts to be more human, and the scene where he's being taught what a joke his had me cringing. Are Van Damme films as bad as this? If they are, I might give them a go.

    I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?! I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. Robots cant bluff... PSYCHE! I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!

    Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast. Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well. Solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

    An independent action sci-fi (The danger alert !) + Mario Van Peebles (Not my star or even close !) + A story about human android (Terminator-Peter Weller-I'll Be Back kind of crap.. NAAAY !) = The early healthy sleep is surely much better ! Though as funny as it may seem (for me mainly) I liked it very much as dexterous action movie or as good story with a lot of important potentials. (Solo) is the electronic super soldier who got human and became more sensitive than all the senseless war machines around him whom ironically are the original humans! It's Frankenstein again but in Schwarzenegger's kind of shape with the conflict of the little village and its protector "one" samurai against his crazy makers ! I just want to assure how catchy the elements of the story were, which made me confused about how the big Hollywood majors missed that one ?! I couldn't believe the presence of so many good things since my experience with familiar low budget flicks was horrible. For instance : The script. Actually they could have recreated Frankenstein who takes revenge cruelly on its makers, but on the contrary we've watched the (human/beast) conflict and how (Solo) personifies  by his muddle newborn humanity  the noble martyr of this inferno or that greedy degenerate human world. Also how it was wonderful to begin hotly enough with the point of attack when (Solo) the robot uses his own merciful tactic, then we watch his past briefly and smartly after. Moreover the nice touches to affirm his importunate desire to be human (the childish wicked tricks, the joy of the smile, the meaning of sacrifice.. etc), and the idea of another electronic more lethal soldier at the end was unpredictable along with expressing as we watch the ultimate confrontation where the heartless American military commander turned perfectly into that mighty monstrosity against the android where the android looked more high and powerful because of what he already learned from the pure human souls. And although the android triumphed eventually, but the sole (solo) must die at the end as the only one there who is deadly and "kind" in the same time, so he couldn't live by the deranged logic of this world, yet his death informed about how the human could win the beast humanly ! That final truthful laugh was such a marvelous end which summarized the main victory of (Solo) and the basic tragic sense of the whole thing (maybe that's what Hollywood hated in this story). The direction wasn't that vapid or that Kubrick either. It made fair action despite the non-zillion budget. Then we come to the matter of (Mario Van Peebles); regardless of the ordinary charisma and the quiet career which both didn't serve him much; this actor confirms here how talented he is. His performance grasped the subtle features of Solo's personality even if it seemed so easy to act. This man, as a true actor, gave a lucid effort to show us (Solo), not as another metallic character done by metallic star; he put some simple human sense in the mix to watch carefully how (Solo) the machine feels the pain of not feeling, to experience the confusion of the human games, and to taste his unfortunate mineral laughter (That was his best scene). (Peebles) succeeded in playing (Solo) clemently; by putting slight doleful compassion with strong pride right in his eyes, voice and moves. Maybe I didn't like that stereotyped forever-evil guy; not because its bad conscience, but for its bad construction, where he was so devilish with no convincing reason or whatsoever ! But anyway, (Solo) is solid piece of work that made such a new Frankenstein, mixed it cleverly with the one-man-army action hero, and while presenting the story of the monster; didn't turn into one itself !

    Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them is a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful. The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one clich&eacute; after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really. Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really. Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films. Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

    Even the most precursory glance at his extensive film work, clearly shows that Mario Van Peebles has sadly never really made it as big in Hollywood as he deserves. Up until now for instance, his most well known roles have been the (enjoyably OTT) sorcerer Kane in Highlander 3 and as effective fish chow in the utterly risible Jaws: The Revenge. The majority of his work tends to have been low key, direct to video fodder which is a real shame, as in my opinion, Peebles is a decent actor with a lot of unfulfilled potential. For instance, I know not whether he ever auditioned for the part, but I would be willing to bet that Peebles would have made a much better Blade than Wesley 'Pay my taxes?!!!' Snipes. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the film reviewed here is hardly likely to help Peebles career any either. In fact, I am slightly puzzled as to why he would have ever taken such a role in the first place (the money was good perhaps?) Peebles plays the eponymous hero of the title  a state of the art, cybernetic weapon who it turns out is struggling with the contradictory nature of the callus orders given unto him by his superiors. On one such mission Solo deliberately sabotages the objective in order to spare some innocent civilians, much to the anger of his commanders who subsequently order him to be decommissioned. However, getting wind of this, Solo decides that self preservation is of the highest order and goes on the run, hotly pursued by a relentless, sadistic colonel (the ever superb William Sadler) who has a particular grudge against what Solo represents. Ending up in a small South American village, Solo is gradually befriended by the locals and begins to learn the nature of humanity. In addition, he serves as their protector from a ruthless gang of bandits. Of course, things don't stay happy for long and the army eventually locate him whereupon much explosive action ensues. Finally, Solo discovers that he is in fact not the only one of his kind when another android is sent to destroy him. Needless to say, there can be only one winner.. Once again, I do wonder why Peebles chose to play such a role; As a guide, if you've ever watched (the gorgeous!) Jerry Ryan in Star Trek: Voyager as Seven Of Nine, then you'll be able to clearly picture exactly how Peebles plays his part. Certainly, the role hardly pushes him as an actor in any way. On the other hand, Peebles did work himself into awesome physical shape for the role and apparently undertook some arduous military/combative style training regimes in order to capture the action authentically (although it has to be said that said scenes have not been exactly well handled by the director here). Whilst Peebles may not get to display at least his acting muscles, as mentioned before, Sadler is excellent as the psychopathic Colonal and it's also great to see an early role here from none other than Adrian Brody of The Pianist fame. At the end of the day, if approached in the right frame of mind, this proves to be a fairly enjoyable, if low key flick, albeit one that seems to take itself perhaps a little too seriously for my liking. Nonetheless, for less discriminating action junkies and fans of the whole android sub genre, this is a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half.

    I just watched "Solo", and I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, I'm not an action movie aficionado, so I have no preconceived preferences for Arnie, Sly, etc. I simply found the movie an enjoyable, maybe mindless, hour-and-a-half. Mario van Peebles did his best to present himself as a cyborg with human tendencies. Barry Corbin is always enjoyable when in his Maurice Minnifield persona. Adrien Brody is wonderfully emotive as the scientist who cares about his creation. My only question, after watching the movie, is how Solo continues to survive without anyone to repair his power management chip.

    Although the robot has "Terminator"-like vision, the filmmakers do not. Mario Van Peebles is a robot. The robot escaped from the military facility that constructed it a la "Short Circuit". The robot booby-traps a village a la "Home Alone". The robot also wishes to look like Michael Jordan. After 80 minutes, the robot learns a valuable lesson about the preciousness of human life which enables him to force monotone laughter through his mechanical voice box. (I gave it a five because it's THAT absurd) These are not exaggerations. This is what you're in for.

    Actor Mario Van Peebles plays a cyborg warrior with a conscience in "Blue Tiger" director Norberto Barba's new science fiction thriller "Solo." This ballistically paced testosterone thriller recycles familiar plot elements from movies such as "Universal Soldier" (1992), "Rambo: First Blood, Part II," and the western classic "The Magnificent Seven." Although "Solo" appears initially as little more than a derivative African-American android opus, Barba has cleverly woven some traditional philosophical ideas about appropriate human behavior into this violent melodrama that go beyond its cinematic pyrotechnics. "Solo" opens aboard a U.S. spy trawler off the coast of an unidentified Latin American country. Army General Clyde Haynes (Barry Corbin of "My Science Project") introduces Solo, a $2-billion bionic soldier prototype designed as the ideal military killing machine. According to Haynes, Solo has no feelings and is ultimately disposable. Furthermore, Solo comes equipped with bullet proof skin, infrared vision, and the amazing ability to intercept radio messages during transmission. Despite his formidable arsenal, Solo has been programmed with conflicting commands by its designer, Dr. Bill Stewart (Adrien Brody of "Splice") has failed to tweak before the cyborg is sent into battle. Colonel Madden (William Sadler of "Die Hard 2: Dead Harder"), a battle-seasoned adrenalin junkie, heads up a commando team dispatched to destroy an airfield that rebel guerrillas are constructing. The Americans slip in under the cover of darkness, and Solo plants the explosives to blow up the airfield. While he is setting up the explosives, Solo scans the area with his infrared vision and spots several noncombatants being used as slave labor. Because these civilians may die from the blast, Solo's command directives prevent him from following orders. When the android decides to defuse the explosives, Madden triggers the remaining charges. Explosions and machine-gun fire erupt, and the Americans scramble for their helicopters, deliberately abandoning their robotic warrior. Solo receives a messianic wound low on his left side that fires his power management chip. But that doesn't keep our super-soldier protagonist from grabbing onto one of the choppers as it lifts off. Back aboard the trawler, Stewart removes the damaged chip. He explains to Solo that the android must switch over to back-up power until the chip can be replaced. This make the super-soldier just a little less invincible. Meanwhile, a furious Haynes and a vindictive Madden demand to know why Solo refused to obey orders. Stewart explains that a glitch occurred when Solo tried to resolve a discrepancy in his command menu. Madden wants to shut Solo down, but Haynes decides to salvage their expensive prototype. Solo intercepts the outgoing transmission and learns that Haynes wants him reprogrammed. Solo consults his menu of functions and learn that his prime directive is self-preservation. Before "Solo" fades to black, our android hero learns that to act selfishly may be logical but is not appropriate human behavior. Solo steals a helicopter and flies off to the mainland. Madden chases him and watches as Solo crashes into a mountain. When Madden sifts through the wreckage, he cannot find a trace of the wily cyborg. Solo managed to survive the crash and has vanished into the bowels of the jungle.. A small boy from the village discovers Solo resting in an underground temple and nearly gets bitten when a snake attacks him. Solo goes on line on the spur of the moments and grabs the snake before its venomous fangs sink into the vulnerable child. Horrified, the lad runs back to his village, but later returns with his father and the rest of the village. When they find the considerably run-down Solo, they believe at first that he is dead. The little boy demands they give him a proper burial. At the church, he bad guy rebels storm in, interrupting the burial ritual, and shoot up the church. Solo springs into action and single-handedly wipes them out. The villagers reveal that the rebels were forcing them under threat of death to clear an airstrip. Solo agrees to teach the farmers how to fight if they will allow him to use parts from an old black and white, portable television to recharge himself. At this point, Peebles emerges as "The Magnificent Seven" stacked into one. They arrange elaborate traps around the village, and Solo shows them how to use bows and arrows to lethal effect. When the rebels return, the villagers give them a reception that throws them off-balance. Back aboard the trawler, surveillance devices warn them about a battle raging in the jungle. Haynes orders Colonel Madden to lead in an elite unit of hand-picked mercenaries to recover Solo. Madden secretly wants to destroy the prototype. If Solo performs well under fire, Madden fears that similar prototypes may eventually replace career soldiers like him. He believes that his men can kill Solo because the android is not only vulnerable but heavily damaged. Once he reaches the mainland, Madden cuts a deal with the slimy rebels to ice Solo. First, Madden fakes evidence so it appears that Solo has gone crazy and torched the village. The Colonel broadcasts deceptive images of a burning hut back to Haynes aboard the trawler and he swallows the lie. As bait to lure Solo out, Madden persuades Haynes to send in Stewart, who learns too late that Madden duped him. Solo manages to rescue his creator in a way that would make Indiana Jones envious. But Stewart is fatally wounded during the escape. "I should never have left college," Stewart laments and hands Solo a rebuilt power chip before he dies. To divulge any other details about the story would undercut the entertainment value of the movie. "Solo" breaks no new ground for this specific type of character or adventure film, but Narba stages the action well. Most audiences have seen everything that Solo eventually learns, especially if they've kept track of Mr. Spock's progress over the years in the original "Star Trek" movies. If you enjoy fast-moving, well-crafted actioneers, "Solo" is worth watching once.

    I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?! I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. Robots cant bluff... PSYCHE! I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!

    Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast. Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well. Solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

    An independent action sci-fi (The danger alert !) + Mario Van Peebles (Not my star or even close !) + A story about human android (Terminator-Peter Weller-I'll Be Back kind of crap.. NAAAY !) = The early healthy sleep is surely much better ! Though as funny as it may seem (for me mainly) I liked it very much as dexterous action movie or as good story with a lot of important potentials. (Solo) is the electronic super soldier who got human and became more sensitive than all the senseless war machines around him whom ironically are the original humans! It's Frankenstein again but in Schwarzenegger's kind of shape with the conflict of the little village and its protector "one" samurai against his crazy makers ! I just want to assure how catchy the elements of the story were, which made me confused about how the big Hollywood majors missed that one ?! I couldn't believe the presence of so many good things since my experience with familiar low budget flicks was horrible. For instance : The script. Actually they could have recreated Frankenstein who takes revenge cruelly on its makers, but on the contrary we've watched the (human/beast) conflict and how (Solo) personifies  by his muddle newborn humanity  the noble martyr of this inferno or that greedy degenerate human world. Also how it was wonderful to begin hotly enough with the point of attack when (Solo) the robot uses his own merciful tactic, then we watch his past briefly and smartly after. Moreover the nice touches to affirm his importunate desire to be human (the childish wicked tricks, the joy of the smile, the meaning of sacrifice.. etc), and the idea of another electronic more lethal soldier at the end was unpredictable along with expressing as we watch the ultimate confrontation where the heartless American military commander turned perfectly into that mighty monstrosity against the android where the android looked more high and powerful because of what he already learned from the pure human souls. And although the android triumphed eventually, but the sole (solo) must die at the end as the only one there who is deadly and "kind" in the same time, so he couldn't live by the deranged logic of this world, yet his death informed about how the human could win the beast humanly ! That final truthful laugh was such a marvelous end which summarized the main victory of (Solo) and the basic tragic sense of the whole thing (maybe that's what Hollywood hated in this story). The direction wasn't that vapid or that Kubrick either. It made fair action despite the non-zillion budget. Then we come to the matter of (Mario Van Peebles); regardless of the ordinary charisma and the quiet career which both didn't serve him much; this actor confirms here how talented he is. His performance grasped the subtle features of Solo's personality even if it seemed so easy to act. This man, as a true actor, gave a lucid effort to show us (Solo), not as another metallic character done by metallic star; he put some simple human sense in the mix to watch carefully how (Solo) the machine feels the pain of not feeling, to experience the confusion of the human games, and to taste his unfortunate mineral laughter (That was his best scene). (Peebles) succeeded in playing (Solo) clemently; by putting slight doleful compassion with strong pride right in his eyes, voice and moves. Maybe I didn't like that stereotyped forever-evil guy; not because its bad conscience, but for its bad construction, where he was so devilish with no convincing reason or whatsoever ! But anyway, (Solo) is solid piece of work that made such a new Frankenstein, mixed it cleverly with the one-man-army action hero, and while presenting the story of the monster; didn't turn into one itself !

    Solo starts as a team of US soldiers go into Soth America to blow up a rebel airstrip, joining them is a robot named Solo (Mario Van Peebles) who can use any weapon ever made, is fifteen times stronger & ten times faster than any human being. Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful. The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one clich&eacute; after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really. Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really. Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films. Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

    Even the most precursory glance at his extensive film work, clearly shows that Mario Van Peebles has sadly never really made it as big in Hollywood as he deserves. Up until now for instance, his most well known roles have been the (enjoyably OTT) sorcerer Kane in Highlander 3 and as effective fish chow in the utterly risible Jaws: The Revenge. The majority of his work tends to have been low key, direct to video fodder which is a real shame, as in my opinion, Peebles is a decent actor with a lot of unfulfilled potential. For instance, I know not whether he ever auditioned for the part, but I would be willing to bet that Peebles would have made a much better Blade than Wesley 'Pay my taxes?!!!' Snipes. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the film reviewed here is hardly likely to help Peebles career any either. In fact, I am slightly puzzled as to why he would have ever taken such a role in the first place (the money was good perhaps?) Peebles plays the eponymous hero of the title  a state of the art, cybernetic weapon who it turns out is struggling with the contradictory nature of the callus orders given unto him by his superiors. On one such mission Solo deliberately sabotages the objective in order to spare some innocent civilians, much to the anger of his commanders who subsequently order him to be decommissioned. However, getting wind of this, Solo decides that self preservation is of the highest order and goes on the run, hotly pursued by a relentless, sadistic colonel (the ever superb William Sadler) who has a particular grudge against what Solo represents. Ending up in a small South American village, Solo is gradually befriended by the locals and begins to learn the nature of humanity. In addition, he serves as their protector from a ruthless gang of bandits. Of course, things don't stay happy for long and the army eventually locate him whereupon much explosive action ensues. Finally, Solo discovers that he is in fact not the only one of his kind when another android is sent to destroy him. Needless to say, there can be only one winner.. Once again, I do wonder why Peebles chose to play such a role; As a guide, if you've ever watched (the gorgeous!) Jerry Ryan in Star Trek: Voyager as Seven Of Nine, then you'll be able to clearly picture exactly how Peebles plays his part. Certainly, the role hardly pushes him as an actor in any way. On the other hand, Peebles did work himself into awesome physical shape for the role and apparently undertook some arduous military/combative style training regimes in order to capture the action authentically (although it has to be said that said scenes have not been exactly well handled by the director here). Whilst Peebles may not get to display at least his acting muscles, as mentioned before, Sadler is excellent as the psychopathic Colonal and it's also great to see an early role here from none other than Adrian Brody of The Pianist fame. At the end of the day, if approached in the right frame of mind, this proves to be a fairly enjoyable, if low key flick, albeit one that seems to take itself perhaps a little too seriously for my liking. Nonetheless, for less discriminating action junkies and fans of the whole android sub genre, this is a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half.

    I just watched "Solo", and I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, I'm not an action movie aficionado, so I have no preconceived preferences for Arnie, Sly, etc. I simply found the movie an enjoyable, maybe mindless, hour-and-a-half. Mario van Peebles did his best to present himself as a cyborg with human tendencies. Barry Corbin is always enjoyable when in his Maurice Minnifield persona. Adrien Brody is wonderfully emotive as the scientist who cares about his creation. My only question, after watching the movie, is how Solo continues to survive without anyone to repair his power management chip.

    Although the robot has "Terminator"-like vision, the filmmakers do not. Mario Van Peebles is a robot. The robot escaped from the military facility that constructed it a la "Short Circuit". The robot booby-traps a village a la "Home Alone". The robot also wishes to look like Michael Jordan. After 80 minutes, the robot learns a valuable lesson about the preciousness of human life which enables him to force monotone laughter through his mechanical voice box. (I gave it a five because it's THAT absurd) These are not exaggerations. This is what you're in for.

    Actor Mario Van Peebles plays a cyborg warrior with a conscience in "Blue Tiger" director Norberto Barba's new science fiction thriller "Solo." This ballistically paced testosterone thriller recycles familiar plot elements from movies such as "Universal Soldier" (1992), "Rambo: First Blood, Part II," and the western classic "The Magnificent Seven." Although "Solo" appears initially as little more than a derivative African-American android opus, Barba has cleverly woven some traditional philosophical ideas about appropriate human behavior into this violent melodrama that go beyond its cinematic pyrotechnics. "Solo" opens aboard a U.S. spy trawler off the coast of an unidentified Latin American country. Army General Clyde Haynes (Barry Corbin of "My Science Project") introduces Solo, a $2-billion bionic soldier prototype designed as the ideal military killing machine. According to Haynes, Solo has no feelings and is ultimately disposable. Furthermore, Solo comes equipped with bullet proof skin, infrared vision, and the amazing ability to intercept radio messages during transmission. Despite his formidable arsenal, Solo has been programmed with conflicting commands by its designer, Dr. Bill Stewart (Adrien Brody of "Splice") has failed to tweak before the cyborg is sent into battle. Colonel Madden (William Sadler of "Die Hard 2: Dead Harder"), a battle-seasoned adrenalin junkie, heads up a commando team dispatched to destroy an airfield that rebel guerrillas are constructing. The Americans slip in under the cover of darkness, and Solo plants the explosives to blow up the airfield. While he is setting up the explosives, Solo scans the area with his infrared vision and spots several noncombatants being used as slave labor. Because these civilians may die from the blast, Solo's command directives prevent him from following orders. When the android decides to defuse the explosives, Madden triggers the remaining charges. Explosions and machine-gun fire erupt, and the Americans scramble for their helicopters, deliberately abandoning their robotic warrior. Solo receives a messianic wound low on his left side that fires his power management chip. But that doesn't keep our super-soldier protagonist from grabbing onto one of the choppers as it lifts off. Back aboard the trawler, Stewart removes the damaged chip. He explains to Solo that the android must switch over to back-up power until the chip can be replaced. This make the super-soldier just a little less invincible. Meanwhile, a furious Haynes and a vindictive Madden demand to know why Solo refused to obey orders. Stewart explains that a glitch occurred when Solo tried to resolve a discrepancy in his command menu. Madden wants to shut Solo down, but Haynes decides to salvage their expensive prototype. Solo intercepts the outgoing transmission and learns that Haynes wants him reprogrammed. Solo consults his menu of functions and learn that his prime directive is self-preservation. Before "Solo" fades to black, our android hero learns that to act selfishly may be logical but is not appropriate human behavior. Solo steals a helicopter and flies off to the mainland. Madden chases him and watches as Solo crashes into a mountain. When Madden sifts through the wreckage, he cannot find a trace of the wily cyborg. Solo managed to survive the crash and has vanished into the bowels of the jungle.. A small boy from the village discovers Solo resting in an underground temple and nearly gets bitten when a snake attacks him. Solo goes on line on the spur of the moments and grabs the snake before its venomous fangs sink into the vulnerable child. Horrified, the lad runs back to his village, but later returns with his father and the rest of the village. When they find the considerably run-down Solo, they believe at first that he is dead. The little boy demands they give him a proper burial. At the church, he bad guy rebels storm in, interrupting the burial ritual, and shoot up the church. Solo springs into action and single-handedly wipes them out. The villagers reveal that the rebels were forcing them under threat of death to clear an airstrip. Solo agrees to teach the farmers how to fight if they will allow him to use parts from an old black and white, portable television to recharge himself. At this point, Peebles emerges as "The Magnificent Seven" stacked into one. They arrange elaborate traps around the village, and Solo shows them how to use bows and arrows to lethal effect. When the rebels return, the villagers give them a reception that throws them off-balance. Back aboard the trawler, surveillance devices warn them about a battle raging in the jungle. Haynes orders Colonel Madden to lead in an elite unit of hand-picked mercenaries to recover Solo. Madden secretly wants to destroy the prototype. If Solo performs well under fire, Madden fears that similar prototypes may eventually replace career soldiers like him. He believes that his men can kill Solo because the android is not only vulnerable but heavily damaged. Once he reaches the mainland, Madden cuts a deal with the slimy rebels to ice Solo. First, Madden fakes evidence so it appears that Solo has gone crazy and torched the village. The Colonel broadcasts deceptive images of a burning hut back to Haynes aboard the trawler and he swallows the lie. As bait to lure Solo out, Madden persuades Haynes to send in Stewart, who learns too late that Madden duped him. Solo manages to rescue his creator in a way that would make Indiana Jones envious. But Stewart is fatally wounded during the escape. "I should never have left college," Stewart laments and hands Solo a rebuilt power chip before he dies. To divulge any other details about the story would undercut the entertainment value of the movie. "Solo" breaks no new ground for this specific type of character or adventure film, but Narba stages the action well. Most audiences have seen everything that Solo eventually learns, especially if they've kept track of Mr. Spock's progress over the years in the original "Star Trek" movies. If you enjoy fast-moving, well-crafted actioneers, "Solo" is worth watching once.

    This little b-grade straight-to-video action joint won't win any awards for it has been done to death, but for what it is it made for a passable outing despite the predictable formulaic nature of the story, silly occurrences and mechanical action set-pieces. "Solo" actually had I thinking of Paul W. S. Anderson's big budgeted "Soldier" that came out two years later. The two surprisingly had some similarities just that "Solo" were set in modern times and in the humid jungle terrain, compared to the futuristic backdrop for "Soldier" which was much more expansive across the board. The basic plot is almost identical. Even a sequence involving a poisonous snake. While the screenplay for "Solo", is actually adapted off Robert Mason's novel "Weapon" and has shades of "Universal Soldier". Solo is cyborg that was created to be the perfect killing machine, but it disobeys an order when it meant killing innocent civilians. The army isn't particularly happy with it, so it plans to re-create it. But before doing that Solo escapes in to the South American jungle. There he helps out a small, poor village that are terrorised by rebel soldiers by providing them fighting spirit. But to top that off the Americans want their creation back, so a small elite group is sent in to get him back. Director Norberto Barba's handling for most part is rushed and lacklustre, where by hiding it with jaded editing and its techno special effects. Still it has some gusto in its climatic exchanges, especially in the one that comes from nowhere that sees two androids colliding. Don't try to compute the script either, sometimes sappy in its emotional details but never does it go beyond its comic-book approach. Mario Van Pebbles is surprisingly convincing, embodying that steely approach but also showing cracks of humane qualities (trying to understand the meaning of a bluff/joke and freaking you out with his cackling). Quite old-hat in the character portrayal, but well done. Having fun William Sadler provides the psychotic edge, as an army Colonel who disapproves of the Solo creation and would do anything to see it fail. "First rule of dealing with the devil. Don't". Going gawky is Adrien Brody as Solo's creator and Barry Corbin is the General in charge of the project. Soulless, but reliable entertainment. "When you hunt a fox, bring your own dogs".

    First off- a quote from the film: Solo: My brain isn't in my head. It's in here Girl: If your brain is in your chest, where is your heart? Solo: I don't have one. I'm beginning to become like a dowsing rod for a bad film. Either that or I'm just watching films that come on Channel 5 more often. I kept seeing ads for Solo and just got that feeling that it would be worth watching, as 1) Mario Van Peebles is crap and 2) It was on Channel 5. Van Peebles is a cyborg built by the military to waste folk. Trouble is he's got a design fault that makes him NOT kill people. Doh. So they decide to get rid of him but he picks up the message to suspend the project (how I'm not sure - he just sort of looks up at a wall), so he jumps ship and heads for a South American village, which is naturally being bullied by rebels or drug dealers or something. I'm not to sure what they are, but be assured the village is full of stereotypes for Solo to interact with. The military sends out Sadler to kick Solo's ass, but Sadler is nuts and seems to shoot people just for the sake of it. Meanwhile Solo is teaching the locals how to fight, as being a computer type allows him to translate Spanish, but then the film forgets and everyone just talks English or something. This film is a mish-mash of Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminator. It's also very very stupid and unintentionally funny. I loved the love interest, even though he's a robot. Or many of the inexplicable moments that are never explained, like how Solo just appears in a pool of water, how he jumps up onto a helicopter, or how connecting himself up to a generator charges him up. There's very little violence until the end, when everyone gets wasted. Sadler gets his back broke and then reappears as a cyborg! The word 'illogical' is overused by Solo in his attempts to be more human, and the scene where he's being taught what a joke his had me cringing. Are Van Damme films as bad as this? If they are, I might give them a go.

Something goes wrong though & Solo refuses to kill innocent civilians which Colonel Frank Madden (William Sadler) isn't happy about, back at base & General Haynes (Barry Corbin) orders Solo to be shut down & reprogrammed. One of Solo's main directives is self preservation so decides to escape back into the South American jungles where Colonel Madden & his men are sent in to recapture it... This Mexican American co-production was directed by Norberto Barba & one has to say Solo is awful. The script by David Corley was based on the novel 'Weapon' by Robert Mason & is one clich&eacute; after another, robots were popular at the time Solo was made in Hollywood & at the box-office so Solo rip-offs the likes of Robocop (1987), Universal Soldier (1992) & the two Terminator flicks as well as having the same setting & basic story as Predator (1987). This is the usual rubbish about an emotionless robot who grows a sense of humanity while being around people, at first he doesn't know what a joke is or why one person would care for another but by the end he develops emotions & starts to befriend people, sounds like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) to me. The character's are poor & Colonel Madden in particular is given absolutely no motivation for hating Solo at all & why he would kill other US soldiers & disobey orders to destroy it. You know I saw this on cable telly last night for free (thank god I didn't spend any money on it) & I looked it up in the TV guide & do you know what it said? My TV guide described Solo as a 'dire sci-fi action starring Mario Van Peebels' which when I think about it is a perfect description of Solo. In less than ten words my TV guide has hit the nail on the head, I mean it's a sci-fi action film, it certainly stars Mario Van Peebles & it's definitely dire. Enough said really. Director Barba doesn't do anything particularly special here & the action scenes lack any real excitement & the sci-fi elements are virtually none existent apart from the fact Solo is a robot. So the military lose Solo & Colonel Madden is sent in to recapture it right? I'm not being funny but wouldn't the military have put a 'self destruct' mechanism inside Solo in case something like that happened? Surely at the very least Solo would have had a tracking device inside it so the military would at least know where it was at any given time? I'm not being funny but these people can come up with a walking talking robotic soldier but they are not clever enough to realise that a tracking or self destruct device might be useful if anything went wrong? The violence is mild, there are a few OK fight scenes but this is pretty weak stuff really. Technically the film looks alright & is competently made, it was actually shot in Mexico. The makers of the Dolph Lundgren action flick Agent Red (2000) edited footage from Solo into that film. The acting is poor, Van Peebles was the perfect choice to play an emotionless robot... William Sadler deserves better than this, it was only a few years prior he was staring in the fantastic Die Hard 2: Die Harder (1990). Solo is a really bad sci-fi action flick which is basically a huge rip-off of big budget Hollywood sci-fi action films like Robocop, Universal Soldier & the Terminator films. Not recommend & I'm going to start & pay more attention to my TV guide when it comes to choosing films to watch...

    Even the most precursory glance at his extensive film work, clearly shows that Mario Van Peebles has sadly never really made it as big in Hollywood as he deserves. Up until now for instance, his most well known roles have been the (enjoyably OTT) sorcerer Kane in Highlander 3 and as effective fish chow in the utterly risible Jaws: The Revenge. The majority of his work tends to have been low key, direct to video fodder which is a real shame, as in my opinion, Peebles is a decent actor with a lot of unfulfilled potential. For instance, I know not whether he ever auditioned for the part, but I would be willing to bet that Peebles would have made a much better Blade than Wesley 'Pay my taxes?!!!' Snipes. Unfortunately, it has to be said that the film reviewed here is hardly likely to help Peebles career any either. In fact, I am slightly puzzled as to why he would have ever taken such a role in the first place (the money was good perhaps?) Peebles plays the eponymous hero of the title  a state of the art, cybernetic weapon who it turns out is struggling with the contradictory nature of the callus orders given unto him by his superiors. On one such mission Solo deliberately sabotages the objective in order to spare some innocent civilians, much to the anger of his commanders who subsequently order him to be decommissioned. However, getting wind of this, Solo decides that self preservation is of the highest order and goes on the run, hotly pursued by a relentless, sadistic colonel (the ever superb William Sadler) who has a particular grudge against what Solo represents. Ending up in a small South American village, Solo is gradually befriended by the locals and begins to learn the nature of humanity. In addition, he serves as their protector from a ruthless gang of bandits. Of course, things don't stay happy for long and the army eventually locate him whereupon much explosive action ensues. Finally, Solo discovers that he is in fact not the only one of his kind when another android is sent to destroy him. Needless to say, there can be only one winner.. Once again, I do wonder why Peebles chose to play such a role; As a guide, if you've ever watched (the gorgeous!) Jerry Ryan in Star Trek: Voyager as Seven Of Nine, then you'll be able to clearly picture exactly how Peebles plays his part. Certainly, the role hardly pushes him as an actor in any way. On the other hand, Peebles did work himself into awesome physical shape for the role and apparently undertook some arduous military/combative style training regimes in order to capture the action authentically (although it has to be said that said scenes have not been exactly well handled by the director here). Whilst Peebles may not get to display at least his acting muscles, as mentioned before, Sadler is excellent as the psychopathic Colonal and it's also great to see an early role here from none other than Adrian Brody of The Pianist fame. At the end of the day, if approached in the right frame of mind, this proves to be a fairly enjoyable, if low key flick, albeit one that seems to take itself perhaps a little too seriously for my liking. Nonetheless, for less discriminating action junkies and fans of the whole android sub genre, this is a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half.

    I just watched "Solo", and I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, I'm not an action movie aficionado, so I have no preconceived preferences for Arnie, Sly, etc. I simply found the movie an enjoyable, maybe mindless, hour-and-a-half. Mario van Peebles did his best to present himself as a cyborg with human tendencies. Barry Corbin is always enjoyable when in his Maurice Minnifield persona. Adrien Brody is wonderfully emotive as the scientist who cares about his creation. My only question, after watching the movie, is how Solo continues to survive without anyone to repair his power management chip.

    Although the robot has "Terminator"-like vision, the filmmakers do not. Mario Van Peebles is a robot. The robot escaped from the military facility that constructed it a la "Short Circuit". The robot booby-traps a village a la "Home Alone". The robot also wishes to look like Michael Jordan. After 80 minutes, the robot learns a valuable lesson about the preciousness of human life which enables him to force monotone laughter through his mechanical voice box. (I gave it a five because it's THAT absurd) These are not exaggerations. This is what you're in for.

    Actor Mario Van Peebles plays a cyborg warrior with a conscience in "Blue Tiger" director Norberto Barba's new science fiction thriller "Solo." This ballistically paced testosterone thriller recycles familiar plot elements from movies such as "Universal Soldier" (1992), "Rambo: First Blood, Part II," and the western classic "The Magnificent Seven." Although "Solo" appears initially as little more than a derivative African-American android opus, Barba has cleverly woven some traditional philosophical ideas about appropriate human behavior into this violent melodrama that go beyond its cinematic pyrotechnics. "Solo" opens aboard a U.S. spy trawler off the coast of an unidentified Latin American country. Army General Clyde Haynes (Barry Corbin of "My Science Project") introduces Solo, a $2-billion bionic soldier prototype designed as the ideal military killing machine. According to Haynes, Solo has no feelings and is ultimately disposable. Furthermore, Solo comes equipped with bullet proof skin, infrared vision, and the amazing ability to intercept radio messages during transmission. Despite his formidable arsenal, Solo has been programmed with conflicting commands by its designer, Dr. Bill Stewart (Adrien Brody of "Splice") has failed to tweak before the cyborg is sent into battle. Colonel Madden (William Sadler of "Die Hard 2: Dead Harder"), a battle-seasoned adrenalin junkie, heads up a commando team dispatched to destroy an airfield that rebel guerrillas are constructing. The Americans slip in under the cover of darkness, and Solo plants the explosives to blow up the airfield. While he is setting up the explosives, Solo scans the area with his infrared vision and spots several noncombatants being used as slave labor. Because these civilians may die from the blast, Solo's command directives prevent him from following orders. When the android decides to defuse the explosives, Madden triggers the remaining charges. Explosions and machine-gun fire erupt, and the Americans scramble for their helicopters, deliberately abandoning their robotic warrior. Solo receives a messianic wound low on his left side that fires his power management chip. But that doesn't keep our super-soldier protagonist from grabbing onto one of the choppers as it lifts off. Back aboard the trawler, Stewart removes the damaged chip. He explains to Solo that the android must switch over to back-up power until the chip can be replaced. This make the super-soldier just a little less invincible. Meanwhile, a furious Haynes and a vindictive Madden demand to know why Solo refused to obey orders. Stewart explains that a glitch occurred when Solo tried to resolve a discrepancy in his command menu. Madden wants to shut Solo down, but Haynes decides to salvage their expensive prototype. Solo intercepts the outgoing transmission and learns that Haynes wants him reprogrammed. Solo consults his menu of functions and learn that his prime directive is self-preservation. Before "Solo" fades to black, our android hero learns that to act selfishly may be logical but is not appropriate human behavior. Solo steals a helicopter and flies off to the mainland. Madden chases him and watches as Solo crashes into a mountain. When Madden sifts through the wreckage, he cannot find a trace of the wily cyborg. Solo managed to survive the crash and has vanished into the bowels of the jungle.. A small boy from the village discovers Solo resting in an underground temple and nearly gets bitten when a snake attacks him. Solo goes on line on the spur of the moments and grabs the snake before its venomous fangs sink into the vulnerable child. Horrified, the lad runs back to his village, but later returns with his father and the rest of the village. When they find the considerably run-down Solo, they believe at first that he is dead. The little boy demands they give him a proper burial. At the church, he bad guy rebels storm in, interrupting the burial ritual, and shoot up the church. Solo springs into action and single-handedly wipes them out. The villagers reveal that the rebels were forcing them under threat of death to clear an airstrip. Solo agrees to teach the farmers how to fight if they will allow him to use parts from an old black and white, portable television to recharge himself. At this point, Peebles emerges as "The Magnificent Seven" stacked into one. They arrange elaborate traps around the village, and Solo shows them how to use bows and arrows to lethal effect. When the rebels return, the villagers give them a reception that throws them off-balance. Back aboard the trawler, surveillance devices warn them about a battle raging in the jungle. Haynes orders Colonel Madden to lead in an elite unit of hand-picked mercenaries to recover Solo. Madden secretly wants to destroy the prototype. If Solo performs well under fire, Madden fears that similar prototypes may eventually replace career soldiers like him. He believes that his men can kill Solo because the android is not only vulnerable but heavily damaged. Once he reaches the mainland, Madden cuts a deal with the slimy rebels to ice Solo. First, Madden fakes evidence so it appears that Solo has gone crazy and torched the village. The Colonel broadcasts deceptive images of a burning hut back to Haynes aboard the trawler and he swallows the lie. As bait to lure Solo out, Madden persuades Haynes to send in Stewart, who learns too late that Madden duped him. Solo manages to rescue his creator in a way that would make Indiana Jones envious. But Stewart is fatally wounded during the escape. "I should never have left college," Stewart laments and hands Solo a rebuilt power chip before he dies. To divulge any other details about the story would undercut the entertainment value of the movie. "Solo" breaks no new ground for this specific type of character or adventure film, but Narba stages the action well. Most audiences have seen everything that Solo eventually learns, especially if they've kept track of Mr. Spock's progress over the years in the original "Star Trek" movies. If you enjoy fast-moving, well-crafted actioneers, "Solo" is worth watching once.

    This little b-grade straight-to-video action joint won't win any awards for it has been done to death, but for what it is it made for a passable outing despite the predictable formulaic nature of the story, silly occurrences and mechanical action set-pieces. "Solo" actually had I thinking of Paul W. S. Anderson's big budgeted "Soldier" that came out two years later. The two surprisingly had some similarities just that "Solo" were set in modern times and in the humid jungle terrain, compared to the futuristic backdrop for "Soldier" which was much more expansive across the board. The basic plot is almost identical. Even a sequence involving a poisonous snake. While the screenplay for "Solo", is actually adapted off Robert Mason's novel "Weapon" and has shades of "Universal Soldier". Solo is cyborg that was created to be the perfect killing machine, but it disobeys an order when it meant killing innocent civilians. The army isn't particularly happy with it, so it plans to re-create it. But before doing that Solo escapes in to the South American jungle. There he helps out a small, poor village that are terrorised by rebel soldiers by providing them fighting spirit. But to top that off the Americans want their creation back, so a small elite group is sent in to get him back. Director Norberto Barba's handling for most part is rushed and lacklustre, where by hiding it with jaded editing and its techno special effects. Still it has some gusto in its climatic exchanges, especially in the one that comes from nowhere that sees two androids colliding. Don't try to compute the script either, sometimes sappy in its emotional details but never does it go beyond its comic-book approach. Mario Van Pebbles is surprisingly convincing, embodying that steely approach but also showing cracks of humane qualities (trying to understand the meaning of a bluff/joke and freaking you out with his cackling). Quite old-hat in the character portrayal, but well done. Having fun William Sadler provides the psychotic edge, as an army Colonel who disapproves of the Solo creation and would do anything to see it fail. "First rule of dealing with the devil. Don't". Going gawky is Adrien Brody as Solo's creator and Barry Corbin is the General in charge of the project. Soulless, but reliable entertainment. "When you hunt a fox, bring your own dogs".

    First off- a quote from the film: Solo: My brain isn't in my head. It's in here Girl: If your brain is in your chest, where is your heart? Solo: I don't have one. I'm beginning to become like a dowsing rod for a bad film. Either that or I'm just watching films that come on Channel 5 more often. I kept seeing ads for Solo and just got that feeling that it would be worth watching, as 1) Mario Van Peebles is crap and 2) It was on Channel 5. Van Peebles is a cyborg built by the military to waste folk. Trouble is he's got a design fault that makes him NOT kill people. Doh. So they decide to get rid of him but he picks up the message to suspend the project (how I'm not sure - he just sort of looks up at a wall), so he jumps ship and heads for a South American village, which is naturally being bullied by rebels or drug dealers or something. I'm not to sure what they are, but be assured the village is full of stereotypes for Solo to interact with. The military sends out Sadler to kick Solo's ass, but Sadler is nuts and seems to shoot people just for the sake of it. Meanwhile Solo is teaching the locals how to fight, as being a computer type allows him to translate Spanish, but then the film forgets and everyone just talks English or something. This film is a mish-mash of Robocop, Universal Soldier and Terminator. It's also very very stupid and unintentionally funny. I loved the love interest, even though he's a robot. Or many of the inexplicable moments that are never explained, like how Solo just appears in a pool of water, how he jumps up onto a helicopter, or how connecting himself up to a generator charges him up. There's very little violence until the end, when everyone gets wasted. Sadler gets his back broke and then reappears as a cyborg! The word 'illogical' is overused by Solo in his attempts to be more human, and the scene where he's being taught what a joke his had me cringing. Are Van Damme films as bad as this? If they are, I might give them a go.

    I was told about this film from a friend who saw it late night during the week He told me it was so bad that I had to see it! So I went on an auction site and bought the film. This is probably the worst film I have EVER seen. It makes you laugh when it really shouldn't. Terrible acting and terrible storyline. Plus he looks nothing like Michael Jackson?! I still recommend buying this film as its one of the funniest things you will ever see. Van Peebles is a joke in this film. Robots cant bluff... PSYCHE! I have to say though the special effects are actually amazing... PSYCHE! DVDs were probably even out when this film came out but if I had my way it would be a straight to VHS release yes people it is THAT bad!

    Solo is an action movie about a Terminator-like android that is constructed and trained for the military. When a flaw is discovered, he is issued to be deprogrammed. Rather than face death, he chooses to flee into the jungles of Central America, where he takes refuge in a village. The military chases him into there, leading into a big action feast. Mario Van Peebles does a decent performance the android. His movements and gestures look mechanical enough to get the job done. Actual scientific realism is abandoned in order to make a good action hero. And it works out; the action scenes aren't that spectacular, but they aren't all too bad either. The acting from the other characters is pretty bad, but I was not expecting anything too good. The special effects were decent as well. Solo is decent as an action flick, but very forgettable. It lacks the substance that most movies possess. But if you just want to pass a couple hours without much thinking, this will get the job done.

    An independent action sci-fi (The danger alert !) + Mario Van Peebles (Not my star or even close !) + A story about human android (Terminator-Peter Weller-I'll Be Back kind of crap.. NAAAY !) = The early healthy sleep is surely much better ! Though as funny as it may seem (for me mainly) I liked it very much as dexterous action movie or as good story with a lot of important potentials. (Solo) is the electronic super soldier who got human and became more sensitive than all the senseless war machines around him whom ironically are the original humans! It's Frankenstein again but in Schwarzenegger's kind of shape with the conflict of the little village and its protector "one" samurai against his crazy makers ! I just want to assure how catchy the elements of the story were, which made me confused about how the big Hollywood majors missed that one ?! I couldn't believe the presence of so many good things since my experience with familiar low budget flicks was horrible. For instance : The script. Actually they could have recreated Frankenstein who takes revenge cruelly on its makers, but on the contrary we've watched the (human/beast) conflict and how (Solo) personifies  by his muddle newborn humanity  the noble martyr of this inferno or that greedy degenerate human world. Also how it was wonderful to begin hotly enough with the point of attack when (Solo) the robot uses his own merciful tactic, then we watch his past briefly and smartly after. Moreover the nice touches to affirm his importunate desire to be human (the childish wicked tricks, the joy of the smile, the meaning of sacrifice.. etc), and the idea of another electronic more lethal soldier at the end was unpredictable along with expressing as we watch the ultimate confrontation where the heartless American military commander turned perfectly into that mighty monstrosity against the android where the android looked more high and powerful because of what he already learned from the pure human souls. And although the android triumphed eventually, but the sole (solo) must die at the end as the only one there who is deadly and "kind" in the same time, so he couldn't live by the deranged logic of this world, yet his death informed about how the human could win the beast humanly ! That final truthful laugh was such a marvelous end which summarized the main victory of (Solo) and the basic tragic sense of the whole thing (maybe that's what Hollywood hated in this story). The direction wasn't that vapid or that Kubrick either. It made fair action despite the non-zillion budget. Then we come to the matter of (Mario Van Peebles); regardless of the ordinary charisma and the quiet career which both didn't serve him much; this actor confirms here how talented he is. His performance grasped the subtle features of Solo's personality even if it seemed so easy to act. This man, as a true actor, gave a lucid effort to show us (Solo), not as another metallic character done by metallic star; he put some simple human sense in the mix to watch carefully how (Solo) the machine feels the pain of not feeling, to experience the confusion of the human games, and to taste his unfortunate mineral laughter (That was his best scene). (Peebles) succeeded in playing (Solo) clemently; by putting slight doleful compassion with strong pride right in his eyes, voice and moves. Maybe I didn't like that stereotyped forever-evil guy; not because its bad conscience, but for its bad construction, where he was so devilish with no convincing reason or whatsoever ! But anyway, (Solo) is solid piece of work that made such a new Frankenstein, mixed it cleverly with the one-man-army action hero, and while presenting the story of the monster; didn't turn into one itself !

Nonetheless, for less discriminating action junkies and fans of the whole android sub genre, this is a harmless enough way to spend an hour and a half.

    I just watched "Solo", and I don't think it's as bad as some reviewers have suggested. Of course, I'm not an action movie aficionado, so I have no preconceived preferences for Arnie, Sly, etc. I simply found the movie an enjoyable, maybe mindless, hour-and-a-half. Mario van Peebles did his best to present himself as a cyborg with human tendencies. Barry Corbin is always enjoyable when in his Maurice Minnifield persona. Adrien Brody is wonderfully emotive as the scientist who cares about his creation. My only question, after watching the movie, is how Solo continues to survive without anyone to repair his power management chip.

    Although the robot has "Terminator"-like vision, the filmmakers do not. Mario Van Peebles is a robot. The robot escaped from the military facility that constructed it a la "Short Circuit". The robot booby-traps a village a la "Home Alone". The robot also wishes to look like Michael Jordan. After 80 minutes, the robot learns a valuable lesson about the preciousness of human life which enables him to force monotone laughter through his mechanical voice box. (I gave it a five because it's THAT absurd) These are not exaggerations. This is what you're in for.
