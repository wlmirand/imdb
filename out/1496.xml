    A man with an important meeting finds himself having to take care of the carpool for the neighbourhood school children when his wife gets sick. Things get awry when he finds himself a victim of a robbery. But the situation only gets worse as a desperate man who had been contemplating a robbery, robs the robbers and takes the man and the kids hostage in their van as his truck is blocked by an armoured car. The father finds during this that his kids don't really respect him and they react better to the robber....... During the mid to late nineties, these were the sort of comedies that were released in the states for a couple of weeks, and then later came straight to video here in the UK. Films like Gone Fishin', Most Wanted, and Wrongfully Accused spring to mind, they are nothing special, have flop written all over them, and have that plastic cheese essence to them all. This film has all the elements to a half decent film, but the performances feel too strained, especially from Paymer and Coates. Arnold is as annoying as ever, but he flashes charm every now and again, so he's not that bad, his character reflects his other performances, so you get what you expect. There are so many tropes in this movie, everyone learns there life lessons come the end, and we all change for the better. Shame the film stinks a little....

    I only saw this movie once years ago. I suppose the fact that I still remember it should be to the film's credit but every time I think about it, I just get filled with revulsion and rage over how incredibly stupid this movie is. Why do I hate it? Well let's start with the premise of Tom Arnold being a goofball who happens to take an entire carpool hostage...how could anyone think this premise would work? Especially with Tom Arnold as the lead? The rest is a series of unfunny chase scenes, including driving through the mall just like the Blues Brothers only that movie was funny and this one...oh and there's one scene where Tom Arnold has the dad hold his hand and give him a baseball related pep talk of some kind (I don't know how to describe it) so that he could urinate. Also scraping the bottom of the barrel in the movie is the treatment of Rachel Leigh Cook as she is subjected to repeated, unwanted advances from the boy who is her age. Pretty sure it qualified as harassment. But when this movie could not get any stupider, it ends with everyone going to the dad's presentation and somehow pitching their horrific kidnapping and ordeal into a commercial pitch. This movie is awful! Avoid it like the plague if you can.

    I don't like Tom Arnold movies, period. Though, the miracle has happened. I liked this one, and so much to be frank. This script has it all. We follow a hostage situation, leads on the run, teen love story, odd couple comedy, bad guys vs. good guys, big fight in a carnival, from zero to hero, rescue in the nick of time, happy ending. And the beautiful thing is that all of that worked too. There were good casting, lines, and chases. However what did overtop everything was the way how this movie mixed comedy with action. Important to mention that it has one of the greatest jumps ever done by a car in the history of cinema; and of course I mean the one which ends the mall's sequence. That was ultra enjoyable and totally unforgettable. David Paymer was born to play that beaten executive and exhausted father. Tom Arnold played that slick desperate carnival owner-turned-criminal finely and, believe it or not, he was funny ! The younger team was fabulous. And the real dessert was Rod Steiger as the scary (naturally) tycoon Mr. Hammerman, a role that couldn't be sweeter without his presence. He won a character which looked like a parody of his film persona, and this movie won him as it too. Wait for his last scene, it's a lovely surprise ! So it's nice fun. And when it comes to Arnold; rare nice fun! Therefore, why all the HATE?!!! I may ascribe not being a commercial hit to the 2 leads' not so flashy charisma; which's the movie's possible flaw. But I still don't know why (Carpool) wasn't fairly appreciated, as a whole, by anyone? There is such a nasty superiority towards it, while praising pure crap produced under the name of art ! I read that Rotten Tomatoes' critics gave it a 0% rating. Well, 0% rating from me to them then ! Finally, watching a good Tom Arnold movie equals seeing actual UFO. Accordingly, (Carpool) is filled with many extra-terrestrials !

    As a kid, I had no knowledge of Cinema. I only relied on Cartoons and Comedies like 'Carpool'. I remember enjoying myself while watching 'Carpool' back in the late 1990's. Now when I saw it on TV after all these-years, When I itself started to watch films like 'Ben Hur', 'Casablanca' etc, I consider this 1996 flick to be a weak effort. 'Carpool' is not a terrible film, but it's not good either. However, Kids of my age back then, enjoyed themselves. In terms of 'Screenplay' & 'Direction', this flick offers nothing magnificent and I can confirm you that the Makers didn't intend to make a 'milestone' film anyway. Their intension was to make Kids laugh, and of what I remember, the kids did. Arthur Hiller's direction as well as the screenplay offer nothing great. For some reason, Tom Arnold won a Razzie-Award for Worst Actor for his performance in here, while David Paymer delivered a truly good performance. David Paymer is amongst "the" most under-rated actors of his time. The kids did a fine job. On the whole, A film that never will be talked about, and I guess it never even wanted to be Evergreen.

    Daniel (David Paymer) is a businessman who works long hours. One morning, his wife gets the flu, leaving him responsible for getting his children dressed, fed, and dropped off at school. He fumes about this, for he has an all-important meeting at ll:00 am. Nevertheless, he piles his two boys, along with three neighbor kids (its Dan's turn to be the carpool driver) into the van and stops for doughnuts for everyone to have a "good" breakfast. Trouble is, at the bakery, there is a hold-up, with Franklin (Tom Arnold) taking the money and taking Daniel hostage, too, to complete a getaway. Franklin is really a nice man but his failing carnival show necessitated the immediate need for funds. Daniel is aghast for he still has his meeting looming on the horizon. After having the kids spray-paint the van purple, to allude authorities, Daniel, Franklin, and the kiddies drive around and around. Will they be caught? And, why does Daniel's children like Franklin better than they like their own father? This movie has a good concept that is, unfortunately, not matched by the film's ultimate execution. The idea that a robber would end up in a mundane carpool routine is infectious but the film's plot line runs thin, at times. Nevertheless, Paymer is a good performer, as is Arnold, who always garners smiles. The children are lively and fun, as well, and the movie's costumes, scenery, and photography make for a good-looking film. To be brief, families will probably enjoy a showing of this flick, for it has humor, chase-scenes, car crashes, and other attention-getting devices. But, it is doubtful that anyone will ask for a repeat showing.

    I distinctly recall sitting down to watch "Carpool" at home ten years ago and being appalled within the first ten minutes by the film's insulting intelligence level. It stars David Paymer as an average Joe who transports a bunch of whiny kids back and forth in a daily carpool. However, one morning he picks up a stranger - or, more specifically, a criminal (Tom Arnold) who may or may not actually be such a bad guy after all. The movie is one of those incredibly lame "family movies" that is clearly designed for one target audience: infantile children who can't differentiate between quality and utter rubbish. This is, sadly, part of the latter category. I don't "hate" Tom Arnold for no good reason like some people out there seem to, but I don't like him very much (he's only ever caught my interest in one movie before - "True Lies") and he's completely aggravating here in a role just about anyone else could have performed better (except, perhaps, for Pauly Shore). Paymer is given the thankless role of a hapless, meek idiot who evidently attended too many Nice Guy Clich&eacute;s 101 classes. Overall, you won't be neglecting yourself anything particularly special if you decide to skip this unfortunate little disaster.

    I watched this film for the first time tonight. I have to say that I did see it on a small television set, but this did not detract at all from Arthur Hiller's obvious and superb genius comedic directing. The film just fills me with a gleeful warm sense of satisfaction. I particularly enjoy the Mall scene where Franklin drives the people carrier into the hordes of poor shoppers! This film really does shine out from other genres within the mid-90's era of comedy. We see here a delightful microcosm, a delectable pastiche capturing the endless hilaritys of two 'star crossed' people coping with the madcap situation which life has bestowed them on this darkest of days. Hiller actually makes you care about the characters, crazy but lovable Franklin (Tom Arnold gives an outstanding performance) with his wacky driving, Daniel with his all so cautious but semi-professional 'keeping it together attitude.' The screaming kids in the back just add to the foreground of this delightful and mystical journey on which we are taken though 90 minutes of mayhem! With a team of talented writers with the likes of Don Rhymer, you know you're just being given gold! I personally would rate this film 9.5, but that's not for the likes of me to decide. I would thoroughly recommend this film to any friend, and will probably be purchasing on DVD as soon as possible.

    CARPOOL was produced by Warner Bros , a film studio with a long history of movie making . You'd think the studio heads would know what makes a successful entertaining film so couldn't have come up with something better than this ? What's that old saying " Never work with children or animals " ? The studio broke one of the rules by employing children as main protagonists and while we don't have much in the way of animals we see another golden rule broken , the one that states " Never work with a duff script " . A man drives his children to school only to get kidnapped by a desperate robber . You probably think you've seen this premise a million times before but it's not really a plot that's been filmed all that many times , probably because it's so weak and obvious which leads me to be confused as to how it survived its pitch . I guess the studio must have been really short of good ideas that month . The already weak plot is brought done even more by the way the actors mug for the camera and the really weak situations: " You put the gun down - No you put the gun down " which means it's not really worth your time seeing

    Think hard now. When was the last time you saw a film wherein so many challenges lie? For example: 1. Bucky is clearly of Canadian descent, however, neither of his parents are. Is the accent meant to imply a) he is an illegitimate child, or b) it was passed on by marathon viewings of Degrassi Junior High? 2. Travis is obviously an Olsen twin in drag, but which one? 3. Whatever happened to the brief fashion craze inspired by this film (a la the Annie Hall look) of young boys with unzipped flys? 4. How did the elderly woman get to the Hammerman's Gourmet Market safely, if, as she implies when Officer Erdman commandeers the vehicle, her brakes are shot? 5. What kind of research would prove that upscale consumers do not like donuts? As you can see, complex plot twists and characterizations abound, and they drive a great minivan through the mall. The cool part: backwards! So, you can see why when Franklin says he's lost his wallet, Daniel's response is, "Why?" Motivation is the key question in this world, and paying off circus performers. And keeping your mom away from the Sizzler, for the love of God!

    Tom Arnold really shined in the movie,i've always liked him and it was great to see him get a leading role. David Paymer played the role of the 'all work, no pleasure,up tight dad' role very well. Even Mr.Hammermin was hilarious at the end when the group gave him slogans for their carnival project. The children played their roles well,with child innocence it's great to see grown people especially men bond with their kids and that's what I got from watching this movie... 7 out of ten! ~CWM~

    Think hard now. When was the last time you saw a film wherein so many challenges lie? For example: 1. Bucky is clearly of Canadian descent, however, neither of his parents are. Is the accent meant to imply a) he is an illegitimate child, or b) it was passed on by marathon viewings of Degrassi Junior High? 2. Travis is obviously an Olsen twin in drag, but which one? 3. Whatever happened to the brief fashion craze inspired by this film (a la the Annie Hall look) of young boys with unzipped flys? 4. How did the elderly woman get to the Hammerman's Gourmet Market safely, if, as she implies when Officer Erdman commandeers the vehicle, her brakes are shot? 5. What kind of research would prove that upscale consumers do not like donuts? As you can see, complex plot twists and characterizations abound, and they drive a great minivan through the mall. The cool part: backwards! So, you can see why when Franklin says he's lost his wallet, Daniel's response is, "Why?" Motivation is the key question in this world, and paying off circus performers. And keeping your mom away from the Sizzler, for the love of God!

    Tom Arnold really shined in the movie,i've always liked him and it was great to see him get a leading role. David Paymer played the role of the 'all work, no pleasure,up tight dad' role very well. Even Mr.Hammermin was hilarious at the end when the group gave him slogans for their carnival project. The children played their roles well,with child innocence it's great to see grown people especially men bond with their kids and that's what I got from watching this movie... 7 out of ten! ~CWM~

    A man with an important meeting finds himself having to take care of the carpool for the neighbourhood school children when his wife gets sick. Things get awry when he finds himself a victim of a robbery. But the situation only gets worse as a desperate man who had been contemplating a robbery, robs the robbers and takes the man and the kids hostage in their van as his truck is blocked by an armoured car. The father finds during this that his kids don't really respect him and they react better to the robber....... During the mid to late nineties, these were the sort of comedies that were released in the states for a couple of weeks, and then later came straight to video here in the UK. Films like Gone Fishin', Most Wanted, and Wrongfully Accused spring to mind, they are nothing special, have flop written all over them, and have that plastic cheese essence to them all. This film has all the elements to a half decent film, but the performances feel too strained, especially from Paymer and Coates. Arnold is as annoying as ever, but he flashes charm every now and again, so he's not that bad, his character reflects his other performances, so you get what you expect. There are so many tropes in this movie, everyone learns there life lessons come the end, and we all change for the better. Shame the film stinks a little....

    I only saw this movie once years ago. I suppose the fact that I still remember it should be to the film's credit but every time I think about it, I just get filled with revulsion and rage over how incredibly stupid this movie is. Why do I hate it? Well let's start with the premise of Tom Arnold being a goofball who happens to take an entire carpool hostage...how could anyone think this premise would work? Especially with Tom Arnold as the lead? The rest is a series of unfunny chase scenes, including driving through the mall just like the Blues Brothers only that movie was funny and this one...oh and there's one scene where Tom Arnold has the dad hold his hand and give him a baseball related pep talk of some kind (I don't know how to describe it) so that he could urinate. Also scraping the bottom of the barrel in the movie is the treatment of Rachel Leigh Cook as she is subjected to repeated, unwanted advances from the boy who is her age. Pretty sure it qualified as harassment. But when this movie could not get any stupider, it ends with everyone going to the dad's presentation and somehow pitching their horrific kidnapping and ordeal into a commercial pitch. This movie is awful! Avoid it like the plague if you can.

    I don't like Tom Arnold movies, period. Though, the miracle has happened. I liked this one, and so much to be frank. This script has it all. We follow a hostage situation, leads on the run, teen love story, odd couple comedy, bad guys vs. good guys, big fight in a carnival, from zero to hero, rescue in the nick of time, happy ending. And the beautiful thing is that all of that worked too. There were good casting, lines, and chases. However what did overtop everything was the way how this movie mixed comedy with action. Important to mention that it has one of the greatest jumps ever done by a car in the history of cinema; and of course I mean the one which ends the mall's sequence. That was ultra enjoyable and totally unforgettable. David Paymer was born to play that beaten executive and exhausted father. Tom Arnold played that slick desperate carnival owner-turned-criminal finely and, believe it or not, he was funny ! The younger team was fabulous. And the real dessert was Rod Steiger as the scary (naturally) tycoon Mr. Hammerman, a role that couldn't be sweeter without his presence. He won a character which looked like a parody of his film persona, and this movie won him as it too. Wait for his last scene, it's a lovely surprise ! So it's nice fun. And when it comes to Arnold; rare nice fun! Therefore, why all the HATE?!!! I may ascribe not being a commercial hit to the 2 leads' not so flashy charisma; which's the movie's possible flaw. But I still don't know why (Carpool) wasn't fairly appreciated, as a whole, by anyone? There is such a nasty superiority towards it, while praising pure crap produced under the name of art ! I read that Rotten Tomatoes' critics gave it a 0% rating. Well, 0% rating from me to them then ! Finally, watching a good Tom Arnold movie equals seeing actual UFO. Accordingly, (Carpool) is filled with many extra-terrestrials !

    As a kid, I had no knowledge of Cinema. I only relied on Cartoons and Comedies like 'Carpool'. I remember enjoying myself while watching 'Carpool' back in the late 1990's. Now when I saw it on TV after all these-years, When I itself started to watch films like 'Ben Hur', 'Casablanca' etc, I consider this 1996 flick to be a weak effort. 'Carpool' is not a terrible film, but it's not good either. However, Kids of my age back then, enjoyed themselves. In terms of 'Screenplay' & 'Direction', this flick offers nothing magnificent and I can confirm you that the Makers didn't intend to make a 'milestone' film anyway. Their intension was to make Kids laugh, and of what I remember, the kids did. Arthur Hiller's direction as well as the screenplay offer nothing great. For some reason, Tom Arnold won a Razzie-Award for Worst Actor for his performance in here, while David Paymer delivered a truly good performance. David Paymer is amongst "the" most under-rated actors of his time. The kids did a fine job. On the whole, A film that never will be talked about, and I guess it never even wanted to be Evergreen.

    Daniel (David Paymer) is a businessman who works long hours. One morning, his wife gets the flu, leaving him responsible for getting his children dressed, fed, and dropped off at school. He fumes about this, for he has an all-important meeting at ll:00 am. Nevertheless, he piles his two boys, along with three neighbor kids (its Dan's turn to be the carpool driver) into the van and stops for doughnuts for everyone to have a "good" breakfast. Trouble is, at the bakery, there is a hold-up, with Franklin (Tom Arnold) taking the money and taking Daniel hostage, too, to complete a getaway. Franklin is really a nice man but his failing carnival show necessitated the immediate need for funds. Daniel is aghast for he still has his meeting looming on the horizon. After having the kids spray-paint the van purple, to allude authorities, Daniel, Franklin, and the kiddies drive around and around. Will they be caught? And, why does Daniel's children like Franklin better than they like their own father? This movie has a good concept that is, unfortunately, not matched by the film's ultimate execution. The idea that a robber would end up in a mundane carpool routine is infectious but the film's plot line runs thin, at times. Nevertheless, Paymer is a good performer, as is Arnold, who always garners smiles. The children are lively and fun, as well, and the movie's costumes, scenery, and photography make for a good-looking film. To be brief, families will probably enjoy a showing of this flick, for it has humor, chase-scenes, car crashes, and other attention-getting devices. But, it is doubtful that anyone will ask for a repeat showing.

    I distinctly recall sitting down to watch "Carpool" at home ten years ago and being appalled within the first ten minutes by the film's insulting intelligence level. It stars David Paymer as an average Joe who transports a bunch of whiny kids back and forth in a daily carpool. However, one morning he picks up a stranger - or, more specifically, a criminal (Tom Arnold) who may or may not actually be such a bad guy after all. The movie is one of those incredibly lame "family movies" that is clearly designed for one target audience: infantile children who can't differentiate between quality and utter rubbish. This is, sadly, part of the latter category. I don't "hate" Tom Arnold for no good reason like some people out there seem to, but I don't like him very much (he's only ever caught my interest in one movie before - "True Lies") and he's completely aggravating here in a role just about anyone else could have performed better (except, perhaps, for Pauly Shore). Paymer is given the thankless role of a hapless, meek idiot who evidently attended too many Nice Guy Clich&eacute;s 101 classes. Overall, you won't be neglecting yourself anything particularly special if you decide to skip this unfortunate little disaster.

    I watched this film for the first time tonight. I have to say that I did see it on a small television set, but this did not detract at all from Arthur Hiller's obvious and superb genius comedic directing. The film just fills me with a gleeful warm sense of satisfaction. I particularly enjoy the Mall scene where Franklin drives the people carrier into the hordes of poor shoppers! This film really does shine out from other genres within the mid-90's era of comedy. We see here a delightful microcosm, a delectable pastiche capturing the endless hilaritys of two 'star crossed' people coping with the madcap situation which life has bestowed them on this darkest of days. Hiller actually makes you care about the characters, crazy but lovable Franklin (Tom Arnold gives an outstanding performance) with his wacky driving, Daniel with his all so cautious but semi-professional 'keeping it together attitude.' The screaming kids in the back just add to the foreground of this delightful and mystical journey on which we are taken though 90 minutes of mayhem! With a team of talented writers with the likes of Don Rhymer, you know you're just being given gold! I personally would rate this film 9.5, but that's not for the likes of me to decide. I would thoroughly recommend this film to any friend, and will probably be purchasing on DVD as soon as possible.

    CARPOOL was produced by Warner Bros , a film studio with a long history of movie making . You'd think the studio heads would know what makes a successful entertaining film so couldn't have come up with something better than this ? What's that old saying " Never work with children or animals " ? The studio broke one of the rules by employing children as main protagonists and while we don't have much in the way of animals we see another golden rule broken , the one that states " Never work with a duff script " . A man drives his children to school only to get kidnapped by a desperate robber . You probably think you've seen this premise a million times before but it's not really a plot that's been filmed all that many times , probably because it's so weak and obvious which leads me to be confused as to how it survived its pitch . I guess the studio must have been really short of good ideas that month . The already weak plot is brought done even more by the way the actors mug for the camera and the really weak situations: " You put the gun down - No you put the gun down " which means it's not really worth your time seeing
