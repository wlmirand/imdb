    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I think describing this as a comedy, which some do, in inaccurate...although the description I did like was a "lighthearted thriller". The makers of the film could have gone for a comedy...but that would have lost my interest almost immediately. And, they could have gone for a totally serious theme of a man going undercover to clear his own record (which, of course, has been done before). Instead, while it is (in my view) a drama, there were quite a few times I found myself smiling. The problem with this film can be summed up with one line about halfway through the movie -- "You won't know who to trust." And as you go through this film, you won't know who the good guys are or who the bad guys are...or who to trust. That makes it just a little confusing. And then, to make it all seem so high tech (which now, a decade later, doesn't seem so high tech at all), everything gets overly complicated...and all this high tech stuff is being done by actors who seem too old for all that stuff. Redford was 56 and Sidney Poitier was 65. However, this is a great cast! But, Robert Redford, playing a man who has been wanted for a federal crime most of his life, seems a bit too old for the plot, as does Sidney Poitier (who seems to have a lot of lines, but it hardly seems like acting...a shame considering what a fine actor he is. Ben Kingsley has a good role as the bad guy, but not a lot of screen time. David Strathairn has perhaps the most interesting and fun role as a high-techie who is blind...and has to drive a truck. Dan Aykroyd has a key -- but unmemorable -- role. Same for River Phoenix...thank goodness it was not the only role of his career. Mary McDonnell is fine as the woman drawn into the heist. To me, this is a very flawed film, but a watchable one with some fun. Recommended for one viewing.

    Sneakers has aged really well. Made in 1992 soon after the end of the Cold War, it offers a sensible, grown up, tense, accurate and not-improbable plot about a group of security consultants who get caught up in a mind-twisting entrapment conspiracy. They are hired to steal a 'black box' a cryptography mathematical formula hardwired into chip that makes it a cyber code-breaker. Obviously this is worth a lot to various governments and organisations and they are hunted by many, and don't know who to trust. Fun, tongue in cheek performances from Robert Redford, Sidney Poitier, David Strathairn, Dan Aykroyd, River Phoenix, Ben Kingsley, Mary McDonnell and James Earl Jones - quite a stellar ensemble cast - are entertaining and whilst not worthy of high acclaim and showers of awards, they are to the point and ideal. The success and overall appeal of this film is the story, the believability and it's lighthearted take on a serious matter. There is action, fun, technology and gadgets used in inventive and intriguing ways, and there's lots of humour. It's the kind of film you can watch again and again, and I have, and I still feel that I don't know it all. The plot is complex and it was quite a few viewings before I had a handle on it as the film doesn't spoon feed the viewer and lots of questions are deliberately left unanswered to add to suspense. The characters are funny, almost anonymous, they aren't multi-dimensional deep with convoluted back stories and tales to tell, but they are all clearly drawn and a little caricatured. There's some great one-liners, some politics and idealism and also loyalty, friendship and love. It's got everything, but without resorting to gratuitous language or violence or obscenity to get the point across, which is a breath of fresh air. It uses intelligence and intrigue, with adult characters (these films are usually college age and is simply a fantastic piece of cinema. I recommend anyone sees it, and it's one that really does stand up to repeated watching, and you'd never know it was over twenty years old as it's still relevant and pertinent today as ultimate codebreakers for hackers are still the holy grail of governments, mega-corporations, organised crime, terrorists, conspiracists and freedom fighters the world over.

    In 1969 Marty Brice and his Friend Cosmo use their university computer to access various organisations bank accounts and give some of their money away; they thought they couldn't be traced but they were wrong; while Marty was out getting pizza Cosmo was arrested and sent to prison. In 1992 Marty is now known as Martin Bishop and he runs a security firm; they get hired by organisations to break in to test their systems. Everything is going fine until one day he is approached by two men claiming to be from the NSA; they want him to acquire a 'black box' from a mathematician whose speciality is cryptography. At first he declines saying he doesn't work for the government but when it becomes apparent that they know who he really is he has no choice as he is still wanted for his little prank all those years ago. They manage to get the box without too much difficulty; that is only the start of their problems though; they discover that is contains a chip that will enable them to bypass any encryption system; it is the sort of device that people and governments would kill for. Knowing this they are quite keen to pass it on to the NSA and forget all about it but once they hand it over it becomes apparent that the people who hired them weren't NSA and now they want to get rid of Martin. If he and his team want to live and not go to gaol they will have to find where the box is now and steal it for a second time... this time it will be much more dangerous though! This is a good light hearted thriller; the story has enough twists and turns without getting overly complex and there are sufficient tense moments as well as a decent number of laughs. The gadget itself is pure science fiction of course but that doesn't matter; it is just something they must get there hands on... twice. The twists aren't the most unexpected; I doubt many people will be surprised when it turns out the people who hired Martin weren't really from the NSA nor will it surprise many people to discover who is behind it all. There is a solid cast led by Robert Redford and featuring the likes of Sidney Poitier, River Phoenix, Dan Aykroyd and Ben Kingsley. Redford is good as Martin and Aykroyd provides most of the laughs as the conspiracy nut known as 'Mother'. This might not by the hardest hitting of thrillers but it is great if you want a good story to pass the time.

    I thought this was a GREAT film when it released and saw it a few times - I guess I was 16 or so at the time. Seeing it again it is a by-the-numbers caper film. James Horner's music sets the mood often over-the-top intense or super light "boy's adventure"... There is a lot of 'humor' which is very light and usually very dry. I think this film, despite it's being a tricksy one is best for oldies who can keep up. The story is a simple double caper setup - steal the goods and then steal them again except harder. But anyone watching will notice that for a bunch of crack security experts the characters behave a little stupidly... Plot holes, occasional sub-par dialogue, out-of-place music and characters that are a bit dull this remains a solid, undemanding thriller.

    If you don't like the human aspects of the movie which is about people who break into systems, move on. I picked this film up on VCR tape with no idea what it was about from a good-will store for $0.75. I consider the price the rental fee and normally take most of the films back so they can resell them and make more money. I kept this one for a few more viewings since it caught the ambivalent spirit of that post cold-war era and have watched it several times. Whistler is patterned after a blind guy that was in on the phone phreaking phenomenon in the 1970s. His real name was Josef Carl Engressia Jr. He was known as Joybubbles. Rather than using the whistle in the Captain Crunch cereals (started by John Draper, alias Captain Crunch) or like some later people who used the blue box he was able to do it all with his own whistling and had perfect pitch. The end of the 60s is really stretching when the kind of breaking in they were doing would have put Cosmo in prison. It really didn't start until the late 70s and early 80s in a significant way. But the DES encryption which would be about the best they had in 1992 was getting long in tooth. DES was created in the 70s with everything finalized around 1977. 3DES and Blowfish encryption algorithms didn't occur until the end of the 90s. So dedicated hardware to break DES was in the realm of possibility. I have news for you people. The breaking of this encryption is not going to be done by Windows machines. It would have to be done with specialized hardware and may not be in the realm of possibility now or then. But your chances for breaking DES in 1995-97 with dedicated hardware would be excellent. But that just shows that there is a lot of bragging among these crackers to con you into believing they are a lot smarter and more able than they really are. Most of the rest of the technical stuff was also stretching it quite a bit. But it was humorous to see these "brilliant" people not knowing what was happening for a good portion of the movie. They bring it to a humorous close at the end. Is Tahiti in Europe? All I want is a phone number. The movie is worth watching a few times. But for somebody who knows that the recent crack (which does not mean broken) of AES-256 has actually made it and AES-192 symmetric encryption more vulnerable than AES-128 I have to tell you to take all of the technical aspects with a grain of salt. How is it possible that a smaller block size equates to more security? They are stretching it to what they claim they can do, not to what they are really able to do. But aren't most movies a lot of make believe?

    Lightweight but reasonably entertaining espionage movie that occasionally turns dark, concerning a group of computer boffins who inadvertently discover a hacked microchip containing top secret codes to critical public utilities with the potential to be catastrophic in the wrong hands. Naturally, the code-breaking programme does fall into the wrong hands (Kingsley) after Redford mistakenly hands it over to shady characters he believed were NSA agents. The tale then focuses on their attempts to recover the programme held under tight security. Redford is typically watchable and he receives good support from Poitier, Phoenix, Aykroyd, McDonnell etc as the good guys (and token girl). James Earl Jones makes a late cameo as an FBI boss attempting to secure the safe return of the codebreaking programme in a scene that it must be said, descends into virtual farce. It's often difficult to gauge the tone of "Sneakers" - one minute there's a bloody execution, the next, characters drop half-baked one-liners and deliberately esoteric computer speak aimed at laughs. The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!

The tone of "Sneakers" reminded me of "Stakeout" in its unorthodox blend of light humour and sometimes violent undertones. Still, despite its flaws and epic two-hour duration, the diverse cast holds interest and the code-breaking, hacking computer intrigue can always generate suspense for viewers with a technical bent. The appearance of River Phoenix might also be a pulley for some viewers, in one of his few adult roles before his untimely death a year later.

    This is a must film for fans who want to know if the world's secrets can be acquired through theft. The answer may surprise many including Officials who believe our Government is secure. This film is entitled " Sneakers " and is about a group of Cyber-specialists who advertise themselves as computer security experts. Their job is to test the encryption systems of various electronic based companies. In their youth, two college students (Jo Marr and Gary Hershberger) seeking to right the world's financial problems, break into a University system as a prank. Unfortunately they are detected and Marr is sent to prison. It is years later and Bishop (Robert Redford) is a legitimate security consultant who is kidnapped because he has stolen a 'Black Box' which can hack into the most secure and sensitive centers of the world. His team consists of other specialists like Donald Crease (Sidney Poitier) Erwin Emory (David Strathairn) 'Mother' (Dan Aykroyd) and River Phoenix as Carl. They have decided to take on the Government agents who are holding Bishop. The problem multiples when the C.I.A. takes an active interest as does Bishop's former friend who seeks his own bit of revenge. The movie is interesting and lively as the level of danger grows until everyone is in danger including the real U.S. government. Easily recommended as a wonderful, but serious film. ****

    I have seen this film several times, and it always entertains. It's got a well-placed plot, and the acting is tremendous. I look back at the supporting cast, and it really is top-notch. There isn't a weak link in the bunch: Redford, Poitier, River Phoenix, David Strathairn, Mary McConnell - even Akroyd is good here. (And that list doesn't even include the magnificent Ben Kingsley!) I saw the film when it first came out as a grad student in math, and yes, the math in the film is absurd. The idea of a key that could break any possible code is utterly absurd. But hey, it's fiction, so it's not worth complaining too much about it. I think it's reasonable for fiction to be occasionally unrealistic - esp. any thing that wants to make for interesting science fiction. From a mathematician's perspective, Sneakers is a breath of fresh in this respect: it doesn't depict mathematicians as crazy.

    Movies that try to do a lot fail more often than they succeed. There's no doubt that "Sneakers" attempts to pull off a lot of things during its 126 minute running time. Just look at the genres its listed under on its page (and believe me, the film spends plenty of time in each of them). But while there are many films that suffer from being overly ambitious, "Sneakers" is not one of them. It's hard to imagine how this film could be any more perfect. Martin Bishop (Robert Redford) runs a business in testing security systems with an eccentric group of characters. However, they are hired by the NSA to steal a mysterious box from a scientist. Of course, not everything is what it seems. To say more would be a crime. "Sneakers" has enough twists and turns to keep the viewer guessing where it will go next. This is achieved by both Phil Alden Robinson's excellent direction, and a smart script where the heroes and villains are equally intelligent. The acting is terrific. Robert Redford is terrific as the low-key Bishop. Bishop has a dark past, but he's likable enough that we still root for him. His crew is made up of actors who turn in equally good performances: Sidney Poitier as the weary Creasy, Dan Aykroyd as the conspiracy freak known as Mother (the banter between Mother and Creasy is hilarious), the late River Phoenix as the teen-aged Carl, and David Stratharin is excellent as the blind, but excellent-hearing Whistler. And Mary McDonnell is delightful as Mary's ex-girlfriend Liz. The villains (I won't say who they are) ooze menace. Phil Alden Robinson made his debut with the hit "Field of Dreams," and he follows it up with "Sneakers." The tone is perfect. It's fun, easy-going, but it leaves room for legitimate tension. It's also oddly nostalgic. The result is a dreamy masterpiece. See "Sneakers." You won't be disappointed.

    I'm always up for a good caper movie, and this is one of the better ones. It doesn't get overworked with such intricacy and tension that trying to keep up with it would prove unsatisfying. Instead, this one puts together a nice blend of mystery, suspense, intrigue and humor, and does it with a capable cast and clever writing. The hacker group's lone egghead is at the same time a conspiracy theorist (Dan Ackroyd) who balances out his own personality, while the rest are a complementary lot to their leader, Robert Redford, alias Martin Brice, alias Martin Bishop. I couldn't quite see Sidney Poitier as a member of the group in the early going, but he did deliver the film's best line in my estimation - "You guys would be chalk outlines without me". The film was somewhat eerily prophetic in it's treatment of an attempt by our country's enemies to acquire access to computers controlling the national power grid. Recent headlines in the news make mention of just such a scenario with the potential to cripple the nation's infrastructure. The bad guys have been pitted against the good guys since the beginning of time, but with each passing year, the stakes continue only to escalate. I tuned in to "Sneakers" last night without realizing that I had seen it before, and kept wondering for a while why I knew what was coming next. It was Mary McDonnell's appearance that finally brought me to my senses - I remembered that she was also pretty hot the first time around!
