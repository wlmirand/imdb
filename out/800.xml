 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  With the disappearance of hack horror writer Sutter Cane, all Hell is breaking loose...literally! Author Cane, it seems, has a knack for description that really brings his evil creepy-crawlies to life. Insurance investigator John Trent is sent to investigate Cane's mysterious vanishing act and ends up in the sleepy little East Coast town of Hobb's End. The fact that this town exists as a figment of Cane's twisted imagination is only the beginning of Trent's problems....

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    A Scary And Frightening Film And One Of The Best Horror Films Of The 90s. Another Carpenter Classic.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy. The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter giving the film a dark and frightening atmosphere and always moving the camera. Great direction by Carpenter. The score by John Carpenter and Jim Lang is great,dark and effective and goes with the scary tone of the film. Another great score from Carpenter. The special make-up effects by K.N.B is amazing,disturbing and realistic. Another great effects work from K.N.B. In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

    After watching In The Mouth of Madness, almost 20 years after its release, my first impression is divided into two: 1) While not a masterpiece (and overrated in my opinion) it wasn't half bad. 2) HP Lovecraft called, he wants his idea/concept/artwork back. So if we ignore the fact that this is obviously a Lovecraft tribute/homage (if not ripoff), In the Mouth of Madness has a very nice story which could really mess one's mind, especially when considering that it was released in 1994. Nowadays "mind twisting" films are a dime a dozen (though the really good ones are hard to find), but at the time a story this crazy and messed up was an act of genius. Still, it's hard to judge a film today by the 90's standards. The acting here was superb, Sam Neil really didn't receive the recognition and publicity he deserved for his talent throughout his career. Julie Carmen was excellent as well, and so was the entire supporting cast. Again, today many films feature creepy children, but the kids in this film were disturbingly scary "before it was cool" (if you don't consider "The Good Son" and "The Omen"). The cinematography and visual effects might have been very extraordinary at the time, but seeing them today feels a little bit like trying to watch a film on a 15" black and white TV screen. Sorry. All in all, the concept is rather fascinating and fairly original, all things considered. But there are many things to consider. Other than being very Lovecraftian, this film offers little. Slightly smart, but not at all scary. Not today, and not to me. I wish I'd seen this film earlier in life, before other more modern films that have slightly spoiled me and set higher expectations. If you're a fan of Lovecraft's fiction, of older Horror and of good ol' fashioned mind twisters - you should really give this a try.

    In the Mouth of Madness may (and at times, does) seem like just another Lovecraft-inspired, low-budget movie, but in reality it possesses some characteristics which really set it apart. The story revolves around John Trent, an insurance claims investigator (played by Sam Neill) who is hired to find Sutter Cane (J&uuml;rgen Prochnow), a famous horror writer who disappeared, and the strange things happening around Trent while he looks for Cane. I don't want to give away any important parts of the movie (but I probably will, anyway), but some things make this movie stand apart from other horror movies: The plot is actually very well-built, with many little loops and twists. The audience, just as Trent, doesn't really know what exactly is going on or where the next twist will come from. There are many cross-references to other movies and books and, the best part, to the movie itself. Three of the actors  Sam Neill, J&uuml;rgen Prochnow and the celebrated Charlton Heston as the owner of the publishing house  simply save the movie, even through some odd sentences in the script (though the odd sentences are there for a reason, which I'll talk about later on, they do sound a little forced). Unfortunately, that only makes Julie Carmen look worse as Linda Styles, the editor who accompanies Trent from about the middle of the movie. Her acting could be a little worse, I suppose, but it would take some effort on her part. The special effects team did a good job, in general, I think. Considering we're talking about 1994, with a relatively low budget, portraying "horrors beyond imagining", any team has a hard time convincing the audience that anything is really monstrous. The flashed pictures are good enough, but the long takes, especially when the light is not so low, fail to cause any impression of fear. The human deformities, however, look real enough to cause some discomfort. Photography is quite good, actually, with different camera takes helping the movie come along. There are no expensive shots, like aerial ones, but we've got top down shots that work very well, and shots that put the viewer in the scene, as it were. View changes are also used to very good effect, but the ones involving Julie Carmen lose some oomph because of her acting. But don't expect any unusual scares  the boogiemen are all there, at exactly the time you expect, with appropriate sound effects, just as expected. But the best thing about this movie, in my opinion, are the cross-references and little jokes. You get quotes and references to Lovecraft, references to Stephen King (including Hobb's End, a town modeled on his own Castle Rock  if you know King, you know Castle Rock), the weird doctor, the Carpenter song playing ("We've only just begun", later also used by Stephen King in 1408, for a different effect), the line "Sorry about the balls  it was a lucky shot" and many others. Final credits also deserve mention: "Human interaction was monitored by the Inter Planetary Psychiatric Association. The body count was high, the casualties are heavy." As I said before, some lines sound awkward, and that's because they were taken from or inspired by Lovecraft's writing. I enjoy reading Lovecraft very much, but he tends to be very verbose, and his characters' conversations never sound natural. All in all, this is a very good movie, and will be great entertainment, especially for the dedicated horror fans, who will have a good time deciphering the references.

    An insurance investigator (Sam Neill) begins discovering that the impact a horror writer's books have on his fans is more than inspirational. I am torn a bit on this film. Had I written this review a decade ago (in 2003), I would have said it was among Carpenter's finest works. I loved this movie, the references to H. P. Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.

    John Carpenter directed this mind-bending horror tale about Insurance investigator John Trent(Sam Neill, quite good) who is sent to locate a missing horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow) who is known to reside in the isolated East Coast town called Hobb's End, where Trent discovers a bizarre group of locals, and strange occurrences that eventually do lead him to Sutter Cane, who believes he can manipulate reality, and intends to unleash ancient monsters onto the world, and vanquishing humanity. Trent tries to stop him, but doesn't quite comprehend the awful truth until the film comes out... Post-modern horror film is quite intriguing and has a very knowing script by John Carpenter that blurs the line between fiction and reality(which is which, and how can we know the difference?) Doesn't always make sense, and comes close to self-parody at times, but mostly an effective, thought-provoking film with a highly memorable(self-mocking!) ending.

    In The Mouth Of Madness is a scary and terrifying film and one of the best Horror films of the 90s. Filled with great direction,wonderful performances and great special effects In The Mouth Of Madness is John Carpenter at his best. In The Mouth Of Madness tells the story of private investigator John Trent(Sam Neill),an investigator who investigates phony insurance claims. Now,Trent is asked to investigate the disappearance of best selling Horror novelist Sutter Cane(Jurgen Prochnow). Unfornately for John Trent this not going to be a typical investigation and for John Trent will be an journey he will never forget and it will blur the lines of fiction and reality and will be a battle for John's sanity. During the time from the early to mid 1990s the Horror genre was seen by critics and most Horror fans as dead. I don't think the Horror genre was dead I think the Horror genre was in a coma and was waiting to wake up. During the time the Horror genre was seen as dead there was a few great Horror films that came out during the early to mid 1990s and one of those Horror films was John Carpenter's In The Mouth Of Madness. In the Mouth Of Madness is the final film in Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy which also includes The Thing and Prince Of Darkness and when it was released in 1995 In The Mouth Of Madness flopped at the box office like most of Carpenter's films. But In The Mouth Of Madness has gain a cult following among Carpenter fans and Horror fans over the years be the film is great and unique. If The Thing was about an Alien Invasion and Prince Of Darkness was about a dark religious theme then In The Mouth Of Madness is about Horror literature coming to life and drawing the line between fiction and reality. That is what so brilliant and scary about this film is the story and concept of the film:what if the stories of authors such Stephen King,H.P Lovecraft or Clive Barker came to life and you are not sure what is reality or what is fiction? In The Mouth Of Madness answers this question in a scary way. ITMOM is a Psychological Horror film in the truest since of the words because it's a Horror film that not only scares you physically but also mentally because when you watch ITMOM you are not sure if the events in the film are really happening or is it all in John Trent's mind or Sutter Cane's mind and you are put into a frightening and bizarre journey into darkness. With Carpenter's Apocalypse Trilogy was about the end of the world and possibly for this film the end of the world doesn't come from human beings explosions or diseases but books. The film was greatly influence by the works of H.P Lovecraft whether it's the title of the film or the scenes with monsters and supernatural things hiding in the dark and visuals that are haunting and disturbing. The screenplay by Michael De Luca is well-written and original with the dialog being cynical but at the same time very scary and creepy. John Trent is a classic Carpenter Antihero is a private detective in the spirit of Film-Noir like classic detective characters like Sam Spade and Phillip Marlow and like those characters Trent is cynical and a loner. While Trent is cynical at the same time we relate to Trent because his character represents the audience and like the audience Trent doesn't understand what is going on or why. There is danger all around the film and Trent can't do anything to stop it or prevent it and you are scared for Trent. Sutter Cane is a scary character not because of the things he does but because of his thinking and his books. Cane thinks that his books are real and that they are more than just literature and not just reality but his reality. The fans of Sutter Cane's books read his novels like reading the Bible and Cane is influencing and affecting his readers to do horrific things. Sutter Cane is more dangerous with his words then his fists or eyes. ITMOM moves at a great pace and when the terror starts it never stops until the end. The violence and gore in the film is shocking and frightening because at times the violence and gore is shown or implied with visuals. The ending of the film is one of the best endings in Horror film history and is a classic Carpenter ending because it is so hopeless,sad and at the same time very funny. It's a great ending that you will never forget. The cast does great jobs in their roles. Sam Neill is excellent as John Trent,with Neill bringing intensity and cynicism to the performance. Julie Carmen does a wonderful job as Linda Styles,Cane's editor who helps John look for Sutter Cane. Jurgen Prochnow is brilliant and frightening as Sutter Cane,with Prochnow bringing believability to role. Charlton Heston(Jackson Harglow),David Warner(Dr. Wrenn),John Glover(Saperstein),Bernie Casey(Robinson),Francis Bay(Mrs. Pickman)and Willeim Von Homburg(Simon)give good performances as well. Also lookout for a cameo by a young Hayden Christensen as a paper boy.

In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Horror films or H.P Lovecraft,I highly suggest you see In The Mouth Of Madness,an effective underrated Horror film that is one of John Carpenter's best films. Highly Recommended. 10/10.

Lovecraft, the creature effects... it was all so very good. Now, my love seems to have dimmed. Revisiting the film for the first time in a long time, I would still confidently say it was the best of Carpenter's work of that era -- easily passing "Vampires" and "Ghosts of Mars". And with the exception of "Cigarette Burns", perhaps his greatest film in the last twenty years. Yet, the effects did not seem to hold as much power over me this time. Yes, they are better than most of the CGI in today's movies. And yes, they are still a great representation of Lovecraft's mythos (better than Stuart Gordon's "Dagon"). But it seems like there was still something a bit silly about them... and for that, I cannot give the movie the full endorsement I wish I could.

    This film is by far one of the best horror movies I've watched in a couple of months, and I watched a lot. This film succeeds in suspense and thrills, I actually jumped a couple of times. The plot was really good, there was an in-pending sense of doom. The film moved along fast, and I wished it was a little longer, I didn't want it to end. Sam Neil is the most notable character, and I enjoy most of his work. The rest of the cast didn't have much to do. I loved the inclusion of monsters, even if they had a small part. I think this film is severely underrated, and deserves a bigger fan base. Check this film out, it's worth your time and money.

    John Trent is an insurance investigator hired to find a bestselling horror novelist, Sutter Cane, who has gone missing with the manuscript of his latest book entitled In The Mouth Of Madness. Trent travels to Hobbs End, an out of the way little town which seems eerily familiar from Cane's novels ... I don't know why but I really like stories where the protagonist is slowly losing their mind (see, for example, The Tenant or Videodrome) and I think this is perhaps my favourite example. Much like Cane's fiction, it's really impossible to summarise the plot of this movie with any kind of accuracy - you just have to see it. For me, it's an incredibly daring narrative, all about the blur between reality and fiction, sanity and insanity, both for Trent as he experiences the events of the plot but also for us as we experience the movie. Carpenter's genius is to create scenes which immediately pull us in and absorb us, but just as rapidly disorient us into disbelieving what we're seeing via a dizzying variety of visual tricks. There are special effects and jump cuts, flashbacks and dreams, powerful montages, pyrotechnic camera-work with wild use of overheads and other weird angles, distorted use of colour and filters, a repeated sequence where the film seems to break and a nihilistic self-mocking tragi-comic ending which for sheer surrealism outdoes anything in the movies of Jean-Luc Godard or David Lynch. It's an amazing cinematic treatment, with eye-popping sequences such as the Twilight Zone journey to Hobbs End, or the incredible moment where Cane tears himself apart to form a breach between his fiction and his reality, but it's also a fascinating treatise on the power of literature and the cult of personality. Cane is perhaps a sly dig at Stephen King (who is my favourite author) but he's really more in the vein of Howard Phillips Lovecraft or Edgar Allan Poe, whose admirers will often confess to having a physical reaction to and personal relationship with their books. The idea that words can carry a corporeal power in of themselves is not original to this story, but I've never seen a movie that explores it with such wit and gleeful abandon. Virtually every scene is full of unsettling detail (the children chasing the dog, the picture in the hotel, the fearful doubt in Warner's eyes) and the Hobbs End locations are somehow beautiful and disturbing at the same time - the incredible Black Church, the villain's lair, is amazingly a real place in Markham, Ontario. As with so many of Carpenter's films this is all of a piece, generating atmosphere through rhythm and movement, building into an overall feeling of dread and horror. The individual elements are all well done, but combine into something so much more than the sum of the parts. Trent is a classic logical hero, whose constant rationalisation of everything is his literal undoing, and Neill is simply outstanding in the part, his transformation from savvy gumshoe to terrified victim full of bravura scenes and offbeat moments. The rest of the cult cast are all terrific in support, notably Prochnow as the wicked Creator/Artist (his first appearance is simply sensational) and the paperboy on the bike is a future Darth Vader, would you believe. The melodic piano-and-guitar score by Carpenter and Jim Lang is fabulous, and Gary B. Kibbe's stylish photography and Edward A. Warschilka's razor-blade editing sweep everything along and pump up all the scares. Brilliantly written by Michael DeLuca, the then boss of production company New Line Cinema, this forms the final part of Carpenter's unofficial Apocalypse Trilogy, the first two movies being the very different but equally stunning The Thing and Prince Of Darkness. A terrific, totally original, very challenging, mindbendingly devious, super-scary horror masterpiece.

    I love that film because its one of the best examples for how a Lovecraft's book can be adapted to a film,not entirely but from some of the basics of his writing.We have the writer that have made that book and suddenly from there some of our mane heroes actually lives the horrific story,a town that you cannot escape,and our protagonist struggles to find his way out from that mad house small town that he's trapped.And in the end finds him self locked in his own mad house bursting to laughs while out something strange happening.They have released out there many movies based on Lovecraft's masterpieces like the necronomicon,re-animator that were good for gore horror flicks,but not so good in the concept because they were trying to build the same stories from the original novels.But with mouth of madness the fact that this is another horror splatter goes away from the moment we see that it was not tried so hard to achieve the thing that those other movies put so much effort to accomplice.

    Horror fiction has been a part of our culture for forever. From the early storytellers, to greats like H.P. Lovecraft and Stephen King. When you find you can't out a Horror novel down, then you know it's good. The best authors know how to tap into our darkest fears. But what if the horrors in these stories were for real? Makes a great idea for a movie doesn't it? Well in 1994, director John Carpenter and writer Michael DeLuca realized it on the screen. The result is not bad, but perhaps not all it could have been. Pros: Well-acted by all. Killer story. Great score, a little different from Carpenter's other stuff. Quite good effects. Quick paced. Some freaky imagery. Some suspense. Raises some good questions. Cons: A lot of cheap scares. Some great ideas that go undeveloped. Some flimsy characters. Lacking tension. Final thoughts: It hurts to see a film with so much potential that doesn't do enough with it. What could have been a truly unsettling experience, is only a little unnerving. The right ingredients are there, but something is missing. That being said, this is still a pretty good film. It has quite a bit of imagination and a few good jolts. My rating: 3.5/5

    This film belongs to a small sub-genre of movies in the mid 1990s, such as "Wes Craven's New Nightmare" (1994) and "Scream" (1996), which were horror films about horror. "In the Mouth of Madness", however, differs from the rest in that it deals with written horror fiction rather than film. The story revolves around an insurance investigator, played by Sam Neill, who is hired to find out whether the disappearance of best-selling horror novelist Sutter Crane (Jurgen Prochnow) is a scam or not. The investigator tracks Crane down to a small town in New Hampshire and begins to discover that Crane's gruesome novels may not be as fictional as they appear. The film works as a homage to writer H.P. Lovecraft, whose work is referenced throughout the film. The film also has a bit of a joke at the phenomenal popularity of Stephen King. John Carpenter is a good director, even if his career can be politely described as uneven, and he does a good job here with an intelligent script and descent performances from a talented cast. The special effects are imaginative and wisely used sparingly. For the most part this is an excellent horror film, with tension, scares and humour, however it falls apart with the increasingly bizarre ending, although even that has it's share of effective moments. Perhaps not a masterpiece, then, but this is still a treat for horror fans and is definitely one of John Carpenter's better films.
