 <sinopse>
  A cat burglar is forced to take a bickering, dysfunctional family hostage on Christmas Eve.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Denis Leary plays an unfortunate cat burglar, who is abandonded by his partner in the middle of a heist, and is forced to take an irritating Connecticut couple (Kevin Spacey, Judy Davis) hostage. He soon finds that he took more than he bargained for when the couple's blackmailing son and despicable in-laws step into the picture. Before long they're driving him nuts with their petty bickering and family problems. The only way for him to survive is to be their referee and resolve their differences, before he can be nabbed by the police.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Dennis Leary stars as a criminal who decides to hold a dysfunctional family hostage in The Ref. The Ref is one of the better Christmas comedies. It has many laugh out loud moments. It's a lot of fun seeing Dennis Leary, Kevin Spacey, and Judy Davis argue for an hour and a half. The Ref is the story of a criminal(played excellently by Dennis Leary) who decides to hold a rich couple(played by Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis), who are going through problems, and their family hostage on Christmas Eve. The criminal goes through a tough time too. He has to suffer with the most dysfunctional family alive. It's a lot of fun watching this movie. Watching Spacey and Davis argue the whole time is really funny. A lot of the scenes with the family are hilarious. I like all of the main celebrities in this film. I don't like them. I love them. That is part of the reason why I loved this film. Forget films like Four Christmases or The Polar express, and look for The Ref on DVD.

    The Ref is a genuinely funny film that mixes elements of dark comedy and elements of holiday films quite well. Some of the jokes are pretty vulgar, but they work in the context of the film. I wonder why a "holiday" film like this was released in March, because it could have done so much better in the prime months of November/December. This film is memorable and for the kind of film it is, it does have a heart and it features some touching moments. Ted Demme's film is about a cat burglar who sets off an alarm by mistake and is forced to kidnap a married couple to use as insurance. But what he doesn't realize is this couple bicker nonstop even under gunpoint, and he may end up solving some nasty disputes. With this kind of material, the direction and the acting have to be good. Luckily, the acting is good. Denis Leary is really funny and at the same time, we realize he's not a truly awful person. Kevin Spacey and Judy Davis kick it off from the get-go and they have awesome chemistry. Their dialog that they interplay with each other goes a long way to making the actors effective. Overall, this is a funny, smart black comedy that will be good counter-viewing as opposed to other holiday films like Elf or The Santa Clause. This is Bad Santa territory right here. Because of the great direction by Demme and wonderful acting by the three main leads, this film rises above most holiday films. I rate this film 9/10.

    Brief storyline of the film, the plot idea is relatively simple; Denis Leary plays Gus a professional burglar who after a foiled robbery seeks to make good his escape by taking married couple Lloyd and Caroline Chasseur hostage. Lloyd (played by Kevin Spacey) and Caroline (played by Judy Davis) are however going through something of a marriage crisis and poor old Gus ends up playing referee between the two warring factions of this married couple. Add in a delinquent son, a mother-in-law of humongous bitchy proportions and a drunken Santa Claus and let the mayhem begin! I have to say that the interplay between Learn, Spacey and Davis is simply fantastic with the machinegun like dialogue whizzing back and forth between them, my favourite quote from the film is Leary's character and he said "From now on, the only person who gets to yell is me. Why? Because I have a gun. People with guns get to do whatever they want. Married people without guns - for instance - you - DO NOT get to yell. Why? NO GUNS! No guns, no yelling. See? Simple little equation." The black humour of the film is just brilliant and it's actually what you would expect from Kevin Spacey and Denis Leary film with past films like "Swimming with Sharks" With likewise the stingingly cruel comments from the mother-in-law from hell are a real hoot, as is the bumbling capers of the town's less than competent police force. What makes the film work on another level though is that the arguments and disagreements that have the family at each other's throats are not contrived or unbelievable. Both husband and wife put forward extremely credible points of view that I'm sure having cropped up in the minds of most viewers. This gives the film a lovely poignancy and all that more enjoyable. Overall, I found this a very funny movie. Judy Davis and Kevin Spacey bounce off each other hilariously, and I found Denis Leary's character just brilliant (and is now one of my favourite comedian) The script is original, the humour is dry, sarcastic and 'laugh out loud' good for a black-comedy so Great stuff!

    On Christmas Eve, jewelry thief Denis Leary (as Gus) takes bickering Connecticut wife Judy Davis (as Caroline) and her husband Kevin Spacey (as Lloyd Chasseur) hostage. The captivated couple argues incessantly, driving Mr. Leary crazy. But, through it all, his hair stays perfect. Police are combing the area, so Leary must suffer as Ms. Davis and Mr. Spacey demonstrate their disintegrating marriage. Meanwhile, boozing buddy Richard Bright (as Murray) tries to help Leary from the outside. Juvenile delinquent son Robert J. Steinmiller Jr. (as Jesse) arrives home for the holiday... Steinmiller has been blackmailing a teacher at military school. When young Steinmiller is also gagged, you have to wonder why Leary didn't give his parents similar treatment - but, then there wouldn't have been a movie. Mouthy matriarch Glynis Johns (as Rose) and other family members show up for supper. Christine Baranski (as Connie) is a noticeable asset. Leary must pretend he is "Dr. Wong" the marriage counselor. People swap foul-mouthed insults and wear weird hats with candles in them. Dinner and the movie are distasteful, but cause no permanent damage. ***** The Ref (3/9/94) Ted Demme ~ Denis Leary, Judy Davis, Kevin Spacey, Robert J. Steinmiller Jr.

    Not really sure what the movie was about since I stopped watching at the 4th "f" word. Just don't care to watch movies that can't be funny without filthy language. Thought I would add The Ref to my collection of Christmas movies, but just couldn't bring myself to place it beside A Christmas Carol, It's A Wonderful Life, White Christmas, Elf, and the many others I have accumulated over the years. After reading the summary of the movie, I thought it would be a fun movie but I respect my family and myself too much to listen to the horrible language. My fault for not reading the rating and the reviews before I purchased the DVD.Too bad it just didn't make the cut.

    I love this movie! I watched it when it first came out and subsequently watch it every holiday. It is the funniest Christmas movie out there in my opinion and no one but Leary could have pulled off Gus. Fantastic! Not for children,due to the swearing, but make this your own Christmas tradition and watch it every year! Fantastic! Every tradition starts somewhere! The acting is just that good that you want to see it repeatedly. I wish they would make another one actually, I think it would do really well if the same actors could reprise their rolls. It surprises me that a lot of people have never even heard of this movie. I lent it out to a coworker and she loved it too. It's certainly a little unknown gem.

    Denis Leary and Kevin Spacey match wits in this ever-so-gently whitewashed holiday staple. Spacey, whose flammable relationship with wife Judy Davis takes center stage in nearly every scene, is at his deadpan sarcastic best from start to finish, while Leary's brand of comedy is somewhat neutered by the family-friendly nature of the picture. At its root, though, this is a startlingly simple premise that never really evolves into something grand enough to carry a feature-length picture. It's got some good one-liners, a few solid recurring gags, a volatile core concept, but can't manage to make the shift into high gear that would've put it over the top.

    This is by far one movie that doesn't get the credit it deserves. I've told several people about this movie and they said that they had never heard of it. After they watched it, they were wondering how this movie has gone so unnoticed. Dennis Leary gives a stunning performance and Kevin Spacey is simply great. There are several great lines in this movie... like when Dennis Leary says to Judy Davis "What are we, girlfriends"? Another of my favorite lines is when the grandmother tells Dennis Leary "you don't have the ball"... HILARIOUS... and his response had me rolling on the floor. I can watch this movie once a week and still lmao. I gave it 10 stars only because I couldn't give it 100 stars. Great movie and great cast too.

    There's no denying it Most of the humour in The Ref is a result of people being mean, and not just "Your Mama's so fat" mean, but "Your Mama's a c*cksucker" mean. Had I not seen it already my first reaction to that is I am as tired of mean-spirited humour as I am of torture masquerading as horror. The fact that it is mean does not make something funny, but if done with a little creativity and in the right context, calling grey haired old ladies "c*ck-suckers" in front of their children and young grandchildren can be funny. Hilarious even. The Ref makes no concessions to political correctness, it is witty, razor-sharp and well plotted and written and yes mean spirited. ___________________________________________________________ It is Christmas Eve. Gus (Denis Leary) is a small time thief, deliberately small time. He plans his heists carefully, takes what he can and lies low for a while, as he says himself he can get in and out of whatever he wants without being detected. By not aiming too high he normally stays under the radar and out of harm's way. On this night the job was to provide enough cash to see Gus out for good and he and his practically useless alcoholic getaway man Murray would see their days out in paradise somewhere. Only this night things went awry, Gus triggered an alarm and Murray bolted leaving Gus to fend for himself, covered in cat p*ss and with dogbites on his arse. In a small town the news that a crafty burglar is loose is met with instant reaction from far more quarters than simply the police. Now the houses Gus chose to steal from were of the well to do (and apparently therefore) "important people" who know others in high places. The police chief is well meaning but ultimately powerless once the local high and mighty gain momentum. With a full court press designed to nab Gus resulting in a curfew and door to door searches Gus is desperate for somewhere to lie low, he takes some impromptu hostages in a convenience store, Caroline and Lloyd Chasseur. This is where the fun starts for all involved. Lloyd and Caroline have been experiencing "marriage problems", in short they basically hate each other and constantly bicker and argue. In betwixt their disagreements is their conniving son Jesse, himself a small time crim who dabbles in blackmailing his military school teachers. Being Christmas Eve Jesse is due home imminently, as are Lloyd's brother, his wife and kids and Grandma Rose for dinner. ******************************* Gus is unaware of what he getting himself into, and in the early stages he struggles to maintain control of the situation even when they are tied up. The couple constantly forget their situation such is the power of their mutual resentment, and they ceaselessly tease and snap at each other and Gus. Gus finds he is pretty much stuck for a while until Murray can find suitable transport, so a plan is hatched that will enable to the dinner to go ahead, Gus will simply play the part of the couple's marriage counsellor. All this sounds pretty dodgy but I can assure you it all works very well. So Jesse arrives first and is immediately tied up and left upstairs as a bargaining chip so that Lloyd and Caroline play along and don't disrupt proceedings. Once the rest of the family arrives it is clear that the standard of manners aren't going to simply improve. To keep matter brief Lloyd's brother is a downtrodden pussy, his wife is a snarky overbearing pretentious bitch, their kids are no prizes either but not too horrible, and Mother Rose Mother Rose deserves her own movie. She is unbelievable. Acting as if the world owes her a favour she is instantly grating, sarcastic, bitchy, presumptuous and scathing, and woe-betide anyone who disagrees with her or dares to criticise her or her actions. The worst thing is that she coolly and calmly spits out every poisonous thinly veiled barb with poise and confidence, like she is doing you a favour by pointing out all your failings. If a more reprehensible 70 something Grandma exists I am yet to see her. Dinner proceeds as planned, complete with an elaborate theme and formal settings. Everyone fakes getting along for a while, just like every large family gathering, but Mother Rose fires things up and then Caroline gets a little drunk. Snippy chat soon turns to a full blown argument, which in turn then explodes into open family warfare. No stone is left unturned and no foible unmentioned as they all hoe into each other with gusto. Gus's mood changes from bemusement to a sense of powerlessness and he gives up pretending that he is a marriage counsellor and steps aside for a while. At the conclusion of the dinner everything possible has been aired and no opinion has been covered up or withheld, there is a lot of swearing, inappropriate comments all around and some extra special rants that have to be seen. Even though the lines are laced with venom and the characters treat each other with disdain it is all unfortunately quite believable and brilliantly delivered. You really think Caroline and Lloyd hate each other, the sister-in-law despises them both and bullies her kids and husband, and EVERYONE detests Mother Rose but puts up with her because she ultimately is cash up and has to die sometime right? And this is before they decide what to do with Gus. Final Rating 9 / 10. Next Christmas dinner must have been verrrry uncomfortable.

    This film falls at the first hurdle for me. It isn't funny at all. I was going to switch it off after 20 minutes but decided to give it another ten in the faint hope of a laugh. It's clearly supposed to be funny but just isn't. The basic premise is that a burglar falls through a trapdoor which is part of the security system of a house he is burgling. The next thing we know he's in a supermarket sticking a gun in the back of a hostage. How he got out and why he wants to take a hostage isn't explained. I'm prepared to suspend reality for films , particularly comedies but this just doesn't make any sense. What relevance has the Police Chief saying that his cops are useless? Maybe that's supposed to be a funny bit. The ingredients are there for a comedy, i.e. gunman taking very argumentative family hostage - but he doesn't need to be there, He could walk away at any time. My advice would be - don't waste your time.
