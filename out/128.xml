    Third time is the charm for this franchise. The previous two movies is good, but this one is better. Not only does it have a better storyline, it has better action as well. This time Jackie Chan as a cop is going undercover in order to infiltrate a Chinese criminal organization. And it has some good action and slapstick humor along the way. Which is expected from Jackie Chan movies. It's just done really well in this one. Maggie Cheung is back again as May(Jackie's girlfriend in the movie). And again she goes through getting put into another conflicting situation. She must really love the hero of this franchise Jackie. It just seems like she is constantly being used as a plot device to put the hero through one troublesome situation after another in this franchise. But at least she is incorporated into the plot somewhat instead of a girlfriend character that pops up once in a while for irrelevant reasons in movies. The relationship between the two reminded me of Mario and Princess Peach. To spice things up a bit, Michelle Yeoh is in this as well and plays the partner in the undercover work with Jackie Chan. And she actually adds a lot to the film and her fighting and stunt works are just fantastic. This movie alone shows how great of a stunt-woman she really is and plus she is a actress. And highly entertaining to watch, probably a bit more than Jackie in this case. Maybe it's because I enjoy the female lead kicking ass in movies. Also when it comes to the undercover work, there is actually quite a bit of creativity and good humor behind it as well. In a lot of cases the third installment just isn't as good as the previous ones. But in this case the third installment is better...Well until the 4th installment. If your one of the audiences that liked the previous Police Story films, there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. This is one of the best buddy cop movie I seen. Although it lacks in bonding development, it backs it up with the chemistry between the two and the action sequences. 7.9/10

    This is a masterpiece. Terrible plot, awful story, non existing character/development. Yet this must be deemed as a 10 star picture. If you go to the far left of film making universe you will find three movies. Tarkovsky's Stalker, Bergman's The silence and Kim Ki Duk's Spring, summer, fall, winter and... spring. These films are slow moving, philosophical, not entertaining. On the far right you have films like: Jackie Chan's Supercop, Schwarzenegger's Commando and Peter Jackson's Dead alive/Braindead. Films with no story, characters, depth, meaning and so on. These movies are pure entertainment. If the action is great, the comedy is great, the gore is great then I'd say that the movie is great. You gotta judge movies based on what they are and not what they aren't. Judge every movie as one hole piece. (In the middle of the far left and far right I'd place Apocalypse now, unarguably one of the greatest films ever made) Verdict: Supercop has got the greatest stunt's in any movie ever and I doubt that it will ever be beaten ever by any movie ever coming out. They don't call them -motion-pictures for nothing. ****/****

    This is a great example of Jackie Chan's mind at work. He knows how to make the best action/comedies and his loyal fans appreciate his efforts. As well as having great costars who can act the part, it must be noted that Maggie Cheung did ALL of her own stunts. The out takes are worth the price of admission, alone. When they show Maggie falling on Jackie wearing the bomb vest, you can tell how much fun they had working together. And the number of takes it took to get it right is evident. His girlfriend in the movie could not have been more cute and helpless. Women 'lobbers' might not care for this as much as the rest of us. When he started coming to the US to meet with directors and producers, he had a lot of time to kill,so he became familiar with the work of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.The comedic influence of these two silent film giants is very obvious.

    The film Police Story III: Supercop is the first Hong Kong movie to be shot with sync sound. It was released in 1993 in Hong Kong and was an instant success. However, it was only given a limited VHS release in the UK and has never been released on DVD. When Police Story 3 was released in the US, Disney bought the rights and killed it. It was given a new soundtrack, dubbed and cut just to make it stupid. Because of this, Cine Asia and HKL have never released this movie. Hopefully in the future it will be bought back and given a real release, until then the only decent version you can see is the Fortune Star HK DVD or the UK VHS which are very hard to find. In my opinion this movie is boring at the start, but eventually becomes an exciting movie.

    Supercop brings together Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh two of the best biggest stars from Hong Kong and both made successful transitions to Hollywood films. Jackie returns with more of his death defying stunts and amazing fight scenes. Michelle even does some big stunts herself, like riding a motorcycle onto the top of a moving train. While Jackie fights off a handful of guys with nothing more then a ladder. The movie is the 3rd movie in Jackie's Police Story series of movies, which have all redefined the action genre with their amazing stunts. But just like all good Jackie Chan movies they're all movies with tons of comedy in them.

    The version I'm reviewing is from the Chinese import DVD. Great follow up from police story one and two. Less action heavy than the first two films and darker in tone yet still has a lot of comedy thrown in. The plot that fills the gaps between action sequences is a lot more engaging than 90% of Jackie Chan's output. Acting performances arn't gonna win any awards but the cast does a good enough job of it Michelle yeoh in particular is a standout , id say this is the best demo of her work pre crouching tiger. The two villains of the piece Kenneth tsang and yuen wah are pretty memorable in there scenes and are both likable and villainous in equal measure. Action wise the film is less stunt heavy than previous entry's but makes up for it with very extreme stunts towards the end. There is a lot of hand to hand/ foot fighting and a larger focus on gun-play in this film which is a breath of fresh air because the film could have easily just been a rehash of parts one and two. As it stands super cop is as good as the first two police story films and id consider it to slightly surpass them. If you have 90 min to spare you cant go wrong watching this film.

    I have always wanted Chackie to mix in more serious roles. His movies are more interesting that way. My favorite part is the who multi-part fight scene. Can you think of a movie with a fight scene with so many protagonists? In that whole scene my favorite bit is when Chackie and Michelle are trying to hide by jumping through the window back into the meeting room and Michelle trips the stick holding open the shutter, leaving Chackie to slam into and bounce off. Michell then pokes her head out and berates him for fooling around. One thing I also liked was that the film kept in a certain amount of comedy, but enough to affect the film enough to make it an outright comedy. Also, liked that first kick Michelle does as she jumps up and kicks two guys at once.

    This is my favorite of all Jackie Chan's "Police Story" series. This movie has lot going for it. It's probably the only movie Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeo stars together, and two best talents in martial arts action movie teams up together to get the drug lord in mainland China. Covertly, this is the most comical of all the "Police Story" series drama, but has the most intense action as well. Interaction between Jackie, and Michelle is so funny, but when they get into the action scene, I would dare to say that this is THE best action movie Hong Kong has ever produced. These guys were really "Super Cops", and it's one of the few movies from the early '90s that still doesn't look dated. Simply fantastic, and highly recommended.

    The third installment in the "Police Story" series has Jackie Chan going to China to intercept the henchman (Yuen Wah) of a drug kingpin. Assisting him is a no-nonsense officer (Michelle Yeoh), while his girlfriend (Maggie Cheung) has no idea what he's up to. As can be expected, the whole movie is an excuse for a series of stunts, namely the sequences in Thailand and Malaysia. I actually didn't like "Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha" ("Supercop" in English) quite as much as the first and fourth movies in the series -- I've never seen the second one -- but there's no denying that it's a really fun experience from beginning to end. Really cool. Stanley Tong later directed Chan in "Rumble in the Bronx" and "First Strike", and then directed the atrocious "Mr. Magoo" movie.

    A Hong Kong detective named Inspector Chan Kui (Jackie Chan) teams up with his female Red Chinese (Michelle Yeoh) counterpart to arrest a Chinese drug czar . &uml;Police Story 3&uml; packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and an evil drug lord . This stirring story about the cop named Chan of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Hong Kong police officer, Chan is sent undercover to mainland China to break up a drug smuggling ring and later in border of Thailand and Cambodia. After breaking the brother of the drug lord out of jail camp , he escapes along with the nasty smuggler . The wife of the crime boss has been detained in Malaysia for drug trafficking and is soon to be executed. However, she is the only person who knows the account number of a secret Swiss bank account hiding millions in drug money. While the two officers are in Malaysia preparing for the prison break , Chan accidentally runs into his girlfriend May, who has travelled there from Hong Kong. Soon his cover is blown, the villains abducts his sweetheart (Maggie Chung) and he is forced to help them pull off the jail break . The story follows him as he tries to stay alive and chase the villain , being pursued by the wicked criminal band . But then Chan turns into an unfortunate cop when the drug lord learns who has been double-crossed . Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game. This exciting movie is crammed of action-packed, spectacular fights, comedy , breathtaking stunt-work and lots of violence . Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots. This time Chan join forces with another agent , a beautiful communist policewoman , well performed by Michelle Yeoh, both of whom are taken to Hong Kong to work for the syndicate . Awesome,incredible stunts and brief comic touches, as usual , the picture is better constructed than its predecessor. The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times because the runtime is overlong , but frenetic action sequences make up for it. Spotlights movie include Jackie jumping over a train , furthermore dangling and downing a helicopter, among others. This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by fine cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains nice sense of humor as well as the previous entries. In this outing Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and good action stars in their own right , such as Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh or Khan . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml;also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches. It's followed by this &uml;Supercop&uml; or &uml;Police story 3&uml; and finally, &uml;Police story IV : Crime story. The motion picture is professionally directed by Stanley Tong . Stanley started his career as a stunt man, but got his first crack at directing in 1983. After that , he founded his own film company, Golden Gate. He wrote, directed, produced, and stunt-directed &uml;Swordsman II&uml; , "Stone Age Warriors", which was so successful that Tong was given the job as director of "Supercop", starring Jackie Chan. His first American film was "Rumble in the Bronx", another Chan film. He directed yet another Chan film "First Strike" and &uml;China Strike Force&uml;. He recently won the Golden Horse Award, a Chinese version of the Oscar , for Supercop. His most recent work is the family comedy "Mr. Magoo" , and &uml;The Myth&uml; , also he has realized some episodes of &uml;Martial Law&uml; series for Sammo Hung . Rating : Good , the picture has its sensational moments , mostly provided by its agile star, the great Jackie Chan.

Jackie Chan is top notch as one army man fighting a group of heinous criminals and as always he makes his own stunts like is showed on the final fake-shots. This time Chan join forces with another agent , a beautiful communist policewoman , well performed by Michelle Yeoh, both of whom are taken to Hong Kong to work for the syndicate . Awesome,incredible stunts and brief comic touches, as usual , the picture is better constructed than its predecessor. The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times because the runtime is overlong , but frenetic action sequences make up for it. Spotlights movie include Jackie jumping over a train , furthermore dangling and downing a helicopter, among others. This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by fine cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains nice sense of humor as well as the previous entries. In this outing Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and good action stars in their own right , such as Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh or Khan . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml;also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches.

    Third time is the charm for this franchise. The previous two movies is good, but this one is better. Not only does it have a better storyline, it has better action as well. This time Jackie Chan as a cop is going undercover in order to infiltrate a Chinese criminal organization. And it has some good action and slapstick humor along the way. Which is expected from Jackie Chan movies. It's just done really well in this one. Maggie Cheung is back again as May(Jackie's girlfriend in the movie). And again she goes through getting put into another conflicting situation. She must really love the hero of this franchise Jackie. It just seems like she is constantly being used as a plot device to put the hero through one troublesome situation after another in this franchise. But at least she is incorporated into the plot somewhat instead of a girlfriend character that pops up once in a while for irrelevant reasons in movies. The relationship between the two reminded me of Mario and Princess Peach. To spice things up a bit, Michelle Yeoh is in this as well and plays the partner in the undercover work with Jackie Chan. And she actually adds a lot to the film and her fighting and stunt works are just fantastic. This movie alone shows how great of a stunt-woman she really is and plus she is a actress. And highly entertaining to watch, probably a bit more than Jackie in this case. Maybe it's because I enjoy the female lead kicking ass in movies. Also when it comes to the undercover work, there is actually quite a bit of creativity and good humor behind it as well. In a lot of cases the third installment just isn't as good as the previous ones. But in this case the third installment is better...Well until the 4th installment. If your one of the audiences that liked the previous Police Story films, there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. This is one of the best buddy cop movie I seen. Although it lacks in bonding development, it backs it up with the chemistry between the two and the action sequences. 7.9/10

    This is a masterpiece. Terrible plot, awful story, non existing character/development. Yet this must be deemed as a 10 star picture. If you go to the far left of film making universe you will find three movies. Tarkovsky's Stalker, Bergman's The silence and Kim Ki Duk's Spring, summer, fall, winter and... spring. These films are slow moving, philosophical, not entertaining. On the far right you have films like: Jackie Chan's Supercop, Schwarzenegger's Commando and Peter Jackson's Dead alive/Braindead. Films with no story, characters, depth, meaning and so on. These movies are pure entertainment. If the action is great, the comedy is great, the gore is great then I'd say that the movie is great. You gotta judge movies based on what they are and not what they aren't. Judge every movie as one hole piece. (In the middle of the far left and far right I'd place Apocalypse now, unarguably one of the greatest films ever made) Verdict: Supercop has got the greatest stunt's in any movie ever and I doubt that it will ever be beaten ever by any movie ever coming out. They don't call them -motion-pictures for nothing. ****/****

    This is a great example of Jackie Chan's mind at work. He knows how to make the best action/comedies and his loyal fans appreciate his efforts. As well as having great costars who can act the part, it must be noted that Maggie Cheung did ALL of her own stunts. The out takes are worth the price of admission, alone. When they show Maggie falling on Jackie wearing the bomb vest, you can tell how much fun they had working together. And the number of takes it took to get it right is evident. His girlfriend in the movie could not have been more cute and helpless. Women 'lobbers' might not care for this as much as the rest of us. When he started coming to the US to meet with directors and producers, he had a lot of time to kill,so he became familiar with the work of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.The comedic influence of these two silent film giants is very obvious.

    The film Police Story III: Supercop is the first Hong Kong movie to be shot with sync sound. It was released in 1993 in Hong Kong and was an instant success. However, it was only given a limited VHS release in the UK and has never been released on DVD. When Police Story 3 was released in the US, Disney bought the rights and killed it. It was given a new soundtrack, dubbed and cut just to make it stupid. Because of this, Cine Asia and HKL have never released this movie. Hopefully in the future it will be bought back and given a real release, until then the only decent version you can see is the Fortune Star HK DVD or the UK VHS which are very hard to find. In my opinion this movie is boring at the start, but eventually becomes an exciting movie.

    Supercop brings together Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh two of the best biggest stars from Hong Kong and both made successful transitions to Hollywood films. Jackie returns with more of his death defying stunts and amazing fight scenes. Michelle even does some big stunts herself, like riding a motorcycle onto the top of a moving train. While Jackie fights off a handful of guys with nothing more then a ladder. The movie is the 3rd movie in Jackie's Police Story series of movies, which have all redefined the action genre with their amazing stunts. But just like all good Jackie Chan movies they're all movies with tons of comedy in them.

    The version I'm reviewing is from the Chinese import DVD. Great follow up from police story one and two. Less action heavy than the first two films and darker in tone yet still has a lot of comedy thrown in. The plot that fills the gaps between action sequences is a lot more engaging than 90% of Jackie Chan's output. Acting performances arn't gonna win any awards but the cast does a good enough job of it Michelle yeoh in particular is a standout , id say this is the best demo of her work pre crouching tiger. The two villains of the piece Kenneth tsang and yuen wah are pretty memorable in there scenes and are both likable and villainous in equal measure. Action wise the film is less stunt heavy than previous entry's but makes up for it with very extreme stunts towards the end. There is a lot of hand to hand/ foot fighting and a larger focus on gun-play in this film which is a breath of fresh air because the film could have easily just been a rehash of parts one and two. As it stands super cop is as good as the first two police story films and id consider it to slightly surpass them. If you have 90 min to spare you cant go wrong watching this film.

    I have always wanted Chackie to mix in more serious roles. His movies are more interesting that way. My favorite part is the who multi-part fight scene. Can you think of a movie with a fight scene with so many protagonists? In that whole scene my favorite bit is when Chackie and Michelle are trying to hide by jumping through the window back into the meeting room and Michelle trips the stick holding open the shutter, leaving Chackie to slam into and bounce off. Michell then pokes her head out and berates him for fooling around. One thing I also liked was that the film kept in a certain amount of comedy, but enough to affect the film enough to make it an outright comedy. Also, liked that first kick Michelle does as she jumps up and kicks two guys at once.

    This is my favorite of all Jackie Chan's "Police Story" series. This movie has lot going for it. It's probably the only movie Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeo stars together, and two best talents in martial arts action movie teams up together to get the drug lord in mainland China. Covertly, this is the most comical of all the "Police Story" series drama, but has the most intense action as well. Interaction between Jackie, and Michelle is so funny, but when they get into the action scene, I would dare to say that this is THE best action movie Hong Kong has ever produced. These guys were really "Super Cops", and it's one of the few movies from the early '90s that still doesn't look dated. Simply fantastic, and highly recommended.

    The third installment in the "Police Story" series has Jackie Chan going to China to intercept the henchman (Yuen Wah) of a drug kingpin. Assisting him is a no-nonsense officer (Michelle Yeoh), while his girlfriend (Maggie Cheung) has no idea what he's up to. As can be expected, the whole movie is an excuse for a series of stunts, namely the sequences in Thailand and Malaysia. I actually didn't like "Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha" ("Supercop" in English) quite as much as the first and fourth movies in the series -- I've never seen the second one -- but there's no denying that it's a really fun experience from beginning to end. Really cool. Stanley Tong later directed Chan in "Rumble in the Bronx" and "First Strike", and then directed the atrocious "Mr. Magoo" movie.

    A Hong Kong detective named Inspector Chan Kui (Jackie Chan) teams up with his female Red Chinese (Michelle Yeoh) counterpart to arrest a Chinese drug czar . &uml;Police Story 3&uml; packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and an evil drug lord . This stirring story about the cop named Chan of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Hong Kong police officer, Chan is sent undercover to mainland China to break up a drug smuggling ring and later in border of Thailand and Cambodia. After breaking the brother of the drug lord out of jail camp , he escapes along with the nasty smuggler . The wife of the crime boss has been detained in Malaysia for drug trafficking and is soon to be executed. However, she is the only person who knows the account number of a secret Swiss bank account hiding millions in drug money. While the two officers are in Malaysia preparing for the prison break , Chan accidentally runs into his girlfriend May, who has travelled there from Hong Kong. Soon his cover is blown, the villains abducts his sweetheart (Maggie Chung) and he is forced to help them pull off the jail break .

    Third time is the charm for this franchise. The previous two movies is good, but this one is better. Not only does it have a better storyline, it has better action as well. This time Jackie Chan as a cop is going undercover in order to infiltrate a Chinese criminal organization. And it has some good action and slapstick humor along the way. Which is expected from Jackie Chan movies. It's just done really well in this one. Maggie Cheung is back again as May(Jackie's girlfriend in the movie). And again she goes through getting put into another conflicting situation. She must really love the hero of this franchise Jackie. It just seems like she is constantly being used as a plot device to put the hero through one troublesome situation after another in this franchise. But at least she is incorporated into the plot somewhat instead of a girlfriend character that pops up once in a while for irrelevant reasons in movies. The relationship between the two reminded me of Mario and Princess Peach. To spice things up a bit, Michelle Yeoh is in this as well and plays the partner in the undercover work with Jackie Chan. And she actually adds a lot to the film and her fighting and stunt works are just fantastic. This movie alone shows how great of a stunt-woman she really is and plus she is a actress. And highly entertaining to watch, probably a bit more than Jackie in this case. Maybe it's because I enjoy the female lead kicking ass in movies. Also when it comes to the undercover work, there is actually quite a bit of creativity and good humor behind it as well. In a lot of cases the third installment just isn't as good as the previous ones. But in this case the third installment is better...Well until the 4th installment. If your one of the audiences that liked the previous Police Story films, there is a high chance you will enjoy this one. This is one of the best buddy cop movie I seen. Although it lacks in bonding development, it backs it up with the chemistry between the two and the action sequences. 7.9/10

    This is a masterpiece. Terrible plot, awful story, non existing character/development. Yet this must be deemed as a 10 star picture. If you go to the far left of film making universe you will find three movies. Tarkovsky's Stalker, Bergman's The silence and Kim Ki Duk's Spring, summer, fall, winter and... spring. These films are slow moving, philosophical, not entertaining. On the far right you have films like: Jackie Chan's Supercop, Schwarzenegger's Commando and Peter Jackson's Dead alive/Braindead. Films with no story, characters, depth, meaning and so on. These movies are pure entertainment. If the action is great, the comedy is great, the gore is great then I'd say that the movie is great. You gotta judge movies based on what they are and not what they aren't. Judge every movie as one hole piece. (In the middle of the far left and far right I'd place Apocalypse now, unarguably one of the greatest films ever made) Verdict: Supercop has got the greatest stunt's in any movie ever and I doubt that it will ever be beaten ever by any movie ever coming out. They don't call them -motion-pictures for nothing. ****/****

    This is a great example of Jackie Chan's mind at work. He knows how to make the best action/comedies and his loyal fans appreciate his efforts. As well as having great costars who can act the part, it must be noted that Maggie Cheung did ALL of her own stunts. The out takes are worth the price of admission, alone. When they show Maggie falling on Jackie wearing the bomb vest, you can tell how much fun they had working together. And the number of takes it took to get it right is evident. His girlfriend in the movie could not have been more cute and helpless. Women 'lobbers' might not care for this as much as the rest of us. When he started coming to the US to meet with directors and producers, he had a lot of time to kill,so he became familiar with the work of Buster Keaton and Harold Lloyd.The comedic influence of these two silent film giants is very obvious.

    The film Police Story III: Supercop is the first Hong Kong movie to be shot with sync sound. It was released in 1993 in Hong Kong and was an instant success. However, it was only given a limited VHS release in the UK and has never been released on DVD. When Police Story 3 was released in the US, Disney bought the rights and killed it. It was given a new soundtrack, dubbed and cut just to make it stupid. Because of this, Cine Asia and HKL have never released this movie. Hopefully in the future it will be bought back and given a real release, until then the only decent version you can see is the Fortune Star HK DVD or the UK VHS which are very hard to find. In my opinion this movie is boring at the start, but eventually becomes an exciting movie.

    Supercop brings together Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeoh two of the best biggest stars from Hong Kong and both made successful transitions to Hollywood films. Jackie returns with more of his death defying stunts and amazing fight scenes. Michelle even does some big stunts herself, like riding a motorcycle onto the top of a moving train. While Jackie fights off a handful of guys with nothing more then a ladder. The movie is the 3rd movie in Jackie's Police Story series of movies, which have all redefined the action genre with their amazing stunts. But just like all good Jackie Chan movies they're all movies with tons of comedy in them.

    The version I'm reviewing is from the Chinese import DVD. Great follow up from police story one and two. Less action heavy than the first two films and darker in tone yet still has a lot of comedy thrown in. The plot that fills the gaps between action sequences is a lot more engaging than 90% of Jackie Chan's output. Acting performances arn't gonna win any awards but the cast does a good enough job of it Michelle yeoh in particular is a standout , id say this is the best demo of her work pre crouching tiger. The two villains of the piece Kenneth tsang and yuen wah are pretty memorable in there scenes and are both likable and villainous in equal measure. Action wise the film is less stunt heavy than previous entry's but makes up for it with very extreme stunts towards the end. There is a lot of hand to hand/ foot fighting and a larger focus on gun-play in this film which is a breath of fresh air because the film could have easily just been a rehash of parts one and two. As it stands super cop is as good as the first two police story films and id consider it to slightly surpass them. If you have 90 min to spare you cant go wrong watching this film.

    I have always wanted Chackie to mix in more serious roles. His movies are more interesting that way. My favorite part is the who multi-part fight scene. Can you think of a movie with a fight scene with so many protagonists? In that whole scene my favorite bit is when Chackie and Michelle are trying to hide by jumping through the window back into the meeting room and Michelle trips the stick holding open the shutter, leaving Chackie to slam into and bounce off. Michell then pokes her head out and berates him for fooling around. One thing I also liked was that the film kept in a certain amount of comedy, but enough to affect the film enough to make it an outright comedy. Also, liked that first kick Michelle does as she jumps up and kicks two guys at once.

    This is my favorite of all Jackie Chan's "Police Story" series. This movie has lot going for it. It's probably the only movie Jackie Chan and Michelle Yeo stars together, and two best talents in martial arts action movie teams up together to get the drug lord in mainland China. Covertly, this is the most comical of all the "Police Story" series drama, but has the most intense action as well. Interaction between Jackie, and Michelle is so funny, but when they get into the action scene, I would dare to say that this is THE best action movie Hong Kong has ever produced. These guys were really "Super Cops", and it's one of the few movies from the early '90s that still doesn't look dated. Simply fantastic, and highly recommended.

    The third installment in the "Police Story" series has Jackie Chan going to China to intercept the henchman (Yuen Wah) of a drug kingpin. Assisting him is a no-nonsense officer (Michelle Yeoh), while his girlfriend (Maggie Cheung) has no idea what he's up to. As can be expected, the whole movie is an excuse for a series of stunts, namely the sequences in Thailand and Malaysia. I actually didn't like "Jing cha gu shi III: Chao ji jing cha" ("Supercop" in English) quite as much as the first and fourth movies in the series -- I've never seen the second one -- but there's no denying that it's a really fun experience from beginning to end. Really cool. Stanley Tong later directed Chan in "Rumble in the Bronx" and "First Strike", and then directed the atrocious "Mr. Magoo" movie.

    A Hong Kong detective named Inspector Chan Kui (Jackie Chan) teams up with his female Red Chinese (Michelle Yeoh) counterpart to arrest a Chinese drug czar . &uml;Police Story 3&uml; packs a violent confrontation between Jackie and an evil drug lord . This stirring story about the cop named Chan of the Hong Kong precinct is well played by Jackie Chan. Hong Kong police officer, Chan is sent undercover to mainland China to break up a drug smuggling ring and later in border of Thailand and Cambodia. After breaking the brother of the drug lord out of jail camp , he escapes along with the nasty smuggler . The wife of the crime boss has been detained in Malaysia for drug trafficking and is soon to be executed. However, she is the only person who knows the account number of a secret Swiss bank account hiding millions in drug money. While the two officers are in Malaysia preparing for the prison break , Chan accidentally runs into his girlfriend May, who has travelled there from Hong Kong. Soon his cover is blown, the villains abducts his sweetheart (Maggie Chung) and he is forced to help them pull off the jail break . The story follows him as he tries to stay alive and chase the villain , being pursued by the wicked criminal band . But then Chan turns into an unfortunate cop when the drug lord learns who has been double-crossed . Then Chan looks for vengeance against the ominous villains at a cat and mouse game.

Awesome,incredible stunts and brief comic touches, as usual , the picture is better constructed than its predecessor. The lighting-paced storyline slows down at times because the runtime is overlong , but frenetic action sequences make up for it. Spotlights movie include Jackie jumping over a train , furthermore dangling and downing a helicopter, among others. This is a phenomenal action movie distinguished by fine cinematography of the spectacular sequences , and contains nice sense of humor as well as the previous entries. In this outing Jackie teamed up to prestigious actresses and good action stars in their own right , such as Maggie Cheung and Michelle Yeoh or Khan . The first version titled &uml;Police story(1985)&uml; directed by the same Jackie Chan was a perfect action film for enthusiastic of the genre ; the following was &uml;Police story 2(1988)&uml;also pretty violent and with abundant humor touches. It's followed by this &uml;Supercop&uml; or &uml;Police story 3&uml; and finally, &uml;Police story IV : Crime story. The motion picture is professionally directed by Stanley Tong . Stanley started his career as a stunt man, but got his first crack at directing in 1983. After that , he founded his own film company, Golden Gate.
