 <sinopse>
  A normal guy blows his top, and a news reporter turns into a national spectacle.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Sam Baily, upset over losing his job, takes a natural history museum hostage. Max Brackett, journalist, is in the museum when this occurs, and gets the scoop. The story spreads nation wide, and soon it is all anyone talks about. The story itself is the news, not the reason why or the real people behind it.

    Although they tend to criticize them and to find their weak spots... As there is touch competition and rivalry in (private) networks, persons with high ambition and need for fame and glory are eager to exploit any person and item for their own benefit. Mostly it is comical, but at times it takes serious or event tragic scope - when/if innocent people, victims or their families are involved. And in the era of online search engines, it is impossible to leave things behind and move on with their lives. The duo Dustin Hoffman - John Travolta is brilliant, at least 2 additional points from me because of them. Other actors are good as well. As for Costa-Cavras, he has directed better stuff: there are twists and turns, but tension is sometimes falling, and those almost two hours are too much for this story. The ending is predictable as well. Nevertheless, Mad City is deserves more attention and bigger ratings than it has achieved. It is no family entertainment, however.

    A down with luck TV reporter (Dustin Hoffman) has the gold chance of his life when he finds the story of a lifetime while covering a hostage situation in a museum. John Travolta plays a fired security who held several kids and a museum director (Blythe Danner) as hostages simply because he wanted his job back. Max Brackett, the reporter, was there doing a small report about the place when everything started right on his front. Here stars the story of "Mad City" and some ponderations on the media role and the ones who watch it, which means, us! Wisely translated in Portuguese as "The Fourth Power" the film directed by Costa Gavras ("Missing", "Z") is satirical without being extremely funny or ridiculous; dramatical without becoming melodramatic; and controversial without being too shocking; criticizes but not that much, pointing its fingers on the media blaming it for being irresponsible and unethical, but where's the criticism towards audiences of this fourth power? Everybody (or almost everybody because every unanimity is dumb) loves sensationalistic journalism and its wide coverage of pointless subjects, sometimes very relevant news. People are very hunger for that and most of the time they don't even care if a sensational news story is true or false. And the media, in countries where it is the fourth power (behind the legislative, executive and judiciary) takes advantage of that, fooling people (but only the ones who want to be fooled or are too ignorant to have a better perspective). So in the film Brackett gets his lesson at the end, but what about the viewers? Most of them didn't get it all, that's why this film is bad criticized and barely heard. And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like "Network" or "Ace in the Hole" this film pales a little in comparison. It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word "City", yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others. The cult status will take a while to be deserved by "Mad City". 10/10

    Costa Gavras' "Mad City" sees actor Dustin Hoffman playing Max Brackett, a television reporter who uses a recent news story to boost his own career. The news story? A recently laid-off security guard returns to the museum at which he worked in an attempt to get his job back. When his former boss (the unsubtly named Mrs Banks) refuses his demands, the security guard goes berserk and holds the entire museum, which is filled with school children, hostage. The film is derivative of Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network", Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" and William Wellman's "Magic Town", but nevertheless goes in some interesting directions. For example, the film uses the Natural History Museum in an ironic fashion, the world of history bulldozed by media, America a soul deadened prison reliant on sensationalized news stories and a constant trickle of crass reports to drum up excitement. The kids held hostage are themselves unfazed, their lives a gun filled television show even before the news vans pulled up. 6.5/10  All of Costa Gavras' Hollywood films are weaker than his foreign language films, but this one is the weakest. Overlong, and badly acted, "Mad City" nevertheless manages to be at once dumber and more complex than its generally given credit. I attribute this paradox to magic.

    I think infinity is the number to which I approach...listing reasons to like this movie. Before I forget the "likeable, trustworthy" Alan Anchor Alda is equal to Walter Cronkite after the oil slick. The evolution of the little girl assistant to Dustin Hoffman...at end wearing red lipstick to match Dustin's blood...if you were to subtract from film all unnecessary dialog/footage you would equal absolute zero. Robert Proskey was born into such roles...The first 2 two kids released were terrified of the assaulting media but loved the man with the gun...When all the kids are released>>>one walks back and says "Thank you SAM"...the stupid ass roof shooters shooting up "Big Indian Bob" in the middle of a great story being told by the man with the gun...Arguably, the best actor of the last 50 years, Dustin Hoffman is pure gold dust but Travolta shines magnificently and...a happy ending was impossible...The ultimate hostage taker is the media!

    The acting is marvelous. Every role is well-cast, and neither lead outshine their character(rather, they disappear nicely into the roles). It's engaging, and it comes across rather credible and psychologically accurate. The production is not flashy, nor does this feel "thrown together". Editing and cinematography are good. It's genuinely funny, here and there. The pacing is great, and this doesn't really lose your interest, as such. Heck, the children aren't even particularly irritating. So why do I give it that relatively low of a vote? Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of those who made it. 6/10

    Mad City is almost a remake of Billy Wilder's Ace In The Hole with a bit of Network thrown in. The Kirk Douglas part has shifted to a television reporter and it's played with relish by Dustin Hoffman. By sheer chance Hoffman is in the Museum Of Natural History when a security guard who's been laid off due to budget cuts, pulls a shotgun out of canvas bag and holds museum director Blythe Danner, a school teacher and her class who were out on a field trip just as the museum is closing. Oh and he accidentally shoots his former co-worker security guard Bill Nunn as well. That kind of seals his fate. As good as Dustin Hoffman is the film really belongs to John Travolta as the desperate security guard, a slow witted kind of man who really hasn't thought through what he's doing. Hoffman realizing he's got an exclusive story becomes Travolta's media adviser, stringing it out for all it's worth. Travolta has to walk a fine line in this film, balancing his character's situation in his portrayal. We empathize with him, many of us who have ever been desperate and without a paycheck, but we can't sympathize with a man who's holding a whole bunch of grade school kids hostage. Sam Bailey ranks as one of the two or three best pieces of work John Travolta has ever done. In the meantime Hoffman who is also mentoring young reporter Mia Kirshner, too well as it turns out, has also got a rivalry with network anchor Alan Alda. One thing I've noticed about Alan Alda, since he's left MASH, he's gone out of his way to take roles that are the farthest thing from good guy Hawkeye Pierce. He and Hoffman hate each other and Alda's attempts to spin the story his way and Hoffman's countermoves are what really set up the inevitable climax. Mad City is not very nice look at the news business and what people will do to get a story. The film has its roots not only in Ace In The Hole and Network, but you could make a case going all the way back to Five Star Final and other films showing the darker side of reporting and the agenda driven people in that business. Sad to say is that the news is business, show business in fact. In the end poor Travolta had to get off the stage.

    Mad City is one of those movies you see in the theater, possibly when you were younger and can remember seeing rated R movies as something of a kind of big deal, and then re-watch it on TV almost as a way to relive the experience as much as enjoy the movie. Then, as one gets older, re-watching the movie isn't quite the same if it isn't, well, very good. And yet even as Mad City isn't something I'd say to a friend "watch this right away, it'll change your life" (that, of course, from Costa-Gravas, would be Z), it's definitely a good view for something on a lazy day or night, or for a minor Dustin Hoffman or (yes) John Travolta craving. It does happen from time to time. The two stars are in very fine shape here- as far as the script can let them be- as a clear-headed but desperate reporter and a security guard with a heap of bad trouble respectively, who are put into an unintentional hostage situation after Travolta's recently fired museum security guard accidentally shoots a fellow guard and has to hold up a bunch of kids who are in the museum (plus Hoffman, in the bathroom after a boring interview while this happens), and then it turns into a media blitz. When these two actors interact the way they do, or even go through their somewhat predictable motions, it works at the least because we get to see Hoffman and Travolta as characters they've worked out and almost perfected in their own way. We believe them in this situation, and that should be enough to make it at least compelling viewing. ...Except, unfortunately, for a preachy screenplay, which half the time is simplistic tabloid entertainment and the other half dogmatic about the nature of the media. Costa-Gravas tries for moments that go for the satirical (one of my favorite bits is when we see the shot security guard recovering in his hospital room, waking up the first time to see a giant camera crane rising outside of his window to get his reaction to seeing a giant camera crane from a news group). It's definitely 20 years too late: Network got their first, quicker, brighter, funnier, and even with some better action. Perhaps there would have been more possibilities if the movie had been made today, when cable news is even more saturated with BS filler, one analysis to the next taking up time from actual other news that could be reported. But, for complaints that can be had with Mad City, and there are more than a few, it's surely watchable Hollywood stuff, and this is thanks to the direction (I really liked the tension when Travolta is telling the kids the Indian ghost story in front of the display in the museum), and a nice roster of supporting/character actors. If you've never seen a Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta movie before, by all means look elsewhere. But if you got nothing better to do, it isn't bad.

    Underrated, that is for sure. I was shocked at the low ratting of this film on IMDb and also that no one had said, "hey you have to see this movie". I think John Travolta gives one of his best performances and Dustin Hoffman is amazing as always and also a great supporting cast. Sure this film does not have the intensity of other films with it's same basic concepts but that is what makes it unique. I find it interesting that most movie critic reviews of this film are not very good, it makes me wonder if that has something to do with it's content. The film focuses on the media and the harm it is capable of causing by at times stirring the pot or reporting then news the way they want it be seen. So movie critics who are part of the media, for the most part hate this film, hmmm? Anyway a great film with great performances that deserved way more attention and praise then it has received.

    I thought this was an excellent movie! It is of course excellent because it has two fantastic actors in it: John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman. They are spectacular actors and whoever decide to put them in the same movie is a pure genius!! When i was reading about it i didn't think it would be my type of movie (even though John Travolta is my favorite actor!) but when i did watch it i thought it was great! Although i was very sad at the end when Sam commits suicide, his poor wife and family but that shows what a splendid actor John Travolta is,he really makes you feel sorry for him even when its not real. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful actor as well and i really think this movie should get some sort of award because it was outstanding!! My hat goes off to John Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and The director!!

    Albeit something of a spoiler, this film ends somewhat like "Soylent Green" in which the protagonist screams "Soylent Green is people!" to awaken and reveal a relevant truth; and so too does the character of Max Bracket, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in an awesomely tragic and long crane shot declare: "WE KILLED HIM, WE KILLED SAM!" as a throng and horde of media and on-lookers engulf him. This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. "Mad City" shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects. "Mad City" therefore, should be compulsory viewing for all Mass Comm majors for it shows how egos can overpower what should be the real impetus behind the news: the pursuit of the truth, and not sensationalism.

    Mad City is one of those movies you see in the theater, possibly when you were younger and can remember seeing rated R movies as something of a kind of big deal, and then re-watch it on TV almost as a way to relive the experience as much as enjoy the movie. Then, as one gets older, re-watching the movie isn't quite the same if it isn't, well, very good. And yet even as Mad City isn't something I'd say to a friend "watch this right away, it'll change your life" (that, of course, from Costa-Gravas, would be Z), it's definitely a good view for something on a lazy day or night, or for a minor Dustin Hoffman or (yes) John Travolta craving. It does happen from time to time. The two stars are in very fine shape here- as far as the script can let them be- as a clear-headed but desperate reporter and a security guard with a heap of bad trouble respectively, who are put into an unintentional hostage situation after Travolta's recently fired museum security guard accidentally shoots a fellow guard and has to hold up a bunch of kids who are in the museum (plus Hoffman, in the bathroom after a boring interview while this happens), and then it turns into a media blitz. When these two actors interact the way they do, or even go through their somewhat predictable motions, it works at the least because we get to see Hoffman and Travolta as characters they've worked out and almost perfected in their own way. We believe them in this situation, and that should be enough to make it at least compelling viewing. ...Except, unfortunately, for a preachy screenplay, which half the time is simplistic tabloid entertainment and the other half dogmatic about the nature of the media. Costa-Gravas tries for moments that go for the satirical (one of my favorite bits is when we see the shot security guard recovering in his hospital room, waking up the first time to see a giant camera crane rising outside of his window to get his reaction to seeing a giant camera crane from a news group). It's definitely 20 years too late: Network got their first, quicker, brighter, funnier, and even with some better action. Perhaps there would have been more possibilities if the movie had been made today, when cable news is even more saturated with BS filler, one analysis to the next taking up time from actual other news that could be reported. But, for complaints that can be had with Mad City, and there are more than a few, it's surely watchable Hollywood stuff, and this is thanks to the direction (I really liked the tension when Travolta is telling the kids the Indian ghost story in front of the display in the museum), and a nice roster of supporting/character actors. If you've never seen a Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta movie before, by all means look elsewhere. But if you got nothing better to do, it isn't bad.

    Underrated, that is for sure. I was shocked at the low ratting of this film on IMDb and also that no one had said, "hey you have to see this movie". I think John Travolta gives one of his best performances and Dustin Hoffman is amazing as always and also a great supporting cast. Sure this film does not have the intensity of other films with it's same basic concepts but that is what makes it unique. I find it interesting that most movie critic reviews of this film are not very good, it makes me wonder if that has something to do with it's content. The film focuses on the media and the harm it is capable of causing by at times stirring the pot or reporting then news the way they want it be seen. So movie critics who are part of the media, for the most part hate this film, hmmm? Anyway a great film with great performances that deserved way more attention and praise then it has received.

    I thought this was an excellent movie! It is of course excellent because it has two fantastic actors in it: John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman. They are spectacular actors and whoever decide to put them in the same movie is a pure genius!! When i was reading about it i didn't think it would be my type of movie (even though John Travolta is my favorite actor!) but when i did watch it i thought it was great! Although i was very sad at the end when Sam commits suicide, his poor wife and family but that shows what a splendid actor John Travolta is,he really makes you feel sorry for him even when its not real. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful actor as well and i really think this movie should get some sort of award because it was outstanding!! My hat goes off to John Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and The director!!

    Albeit something of a spoiler, this film ends somewhat like "Soylent Green" in which the protagonist screams "Soylent Green is people!" to awaken and reveal a relevant truth; and so too does the character of Max Bracket, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in an awesomely tragic and long crane shot declare: "WE KILLED HIM, WE KILLED SAM!" as a throng and horde of media and on-lookers engulf him. This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. "Mad City" shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects. "Mad City" therefore, should be compulsory viewing for all Mass Comm majors for it shows how egos can overpower what should be the real impetus behind the news: the pursuit of the truth, and not sensationalism.

    Although they tend to criticize them and to find their weak spots... As there is touch competition and rivalry in (private) networks, persons with high ambition and need for fame and glory are eager to exploit any person and item for their own benefit. Mostly it is comical, but at times it takes serious or event tragic scope - when/if innocent people, victims or their families are involved. And in the era of online search engines, it is impossible to leave things behind and move on with their lives. The duo Dustin Hoffman - John Travolta is brilliant, at least 2 additional points from me because of them. Other actors are good as well. As for Costa-Cavras, he has directed better stuff: there are twists and turns, but tension is sometimes falling, and those almost two hours are too much for this story. The ending is predictable as well. Nevertheless, Mad City is deserves more attention and bigger ratings than it has achieved. It is no family entertainment, however.

    A down with luck TV reporter (Dustin Hoffman) has the gold chance of his life when he finds the story of a lifetime while covering a hostage situation in a museum. John Travolta plays a fired security who held several kids and a museum director (Blythe Danner) as hostages simply because he wanted his job back. Max Brackett, the reporter, was there doing a small report about the place when everything started right on his front. Here stars the story of "Mad City" and some ponderations on the media role and the ones who watch it, which means, us! Wisely translated in Portuguese as "The Fourth Power" the film directed by Costa Gavras ("Missing", "Z") is satirical without being extremely funny or ridiculous; dramatical without becoming melodramatic; and controversial without being too shocking; criticizes but not that much, pointing its fingers on the media blaming it for being irresponsible and unethical, but where's the criticism towards audiences of this fourth power? Everybody (or almost everybody because every unanimity is dumb) loves sensationalistic journalism and its wide coverage of pointless subjects, sometimes very relevant news. People are very hunger for that and most of the time they don't even care if a sensational news story is true or false. And the media, in countries where it is the fourth power (behind the legislative, executive and judiciary) takes advantage of that, fooling people (but only the ones who want to be fooled or are too ignorant to have a better perspective). So in the film Brackett gets his lesson at the end, but what about the viewers? Most of them didn't get it all, that's why this film is bad criticized and barely heard. And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like "Network" or "Ace in the Hole" this film pales a little in comparison. It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word "City", yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others. The cult status will take a while to be deserved by "Mad City". 10/10

    Costa Gavras' "Mad City" sees actor Dustin Hoffman playing Max Brackett, a television reporter who uses a recent news story to boost his own career. The news story? A recently laid-off security guard returns to the museum at which he worked in an attempt to get his job back. When his former boss (the unsubtly named Mrs Banks) refuses his demands, the security guard goes berserk and holds the entire museum, which is filled with school children, hostage. The film is derivative of Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network", Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" and William Wellman's "Magic Town", but nevertheless goes in some interesting directions. For example, the film uses the Natural History Museum in an ironic fashion, the world of history bulldozed by media, America a soul deadened prison reliant on sensationalized news stories and a constant trickle of crass reports to drum up excitement. The kids held hostage are themselves unfazed, their lives a gun filled television show even before the news vans pulled up. 6.5/10  All of Costa Gavras' Hollywood films are weaker than his foreign language films, but this one is the weakest. Overlong, and badly acted, "Mad City" nevertheless manages to be at once dumber and more complex than its generally given credit. I attribute this paradox to magic.

    I think infinity is the number to which I approach...listing reasons to like this movie. Before I forget the "likeable, trustworthy" Alan Anchor Alda is equal to Walter Cronkite after the oil slick. The evolution of the little girl assistant to Dustin Hoffman...at end wearing red lipstick to match Dustin's blood...if you were to subtract from film all unnecessary dialog/footage you would equal absolute zero. Robert Proskey was born into such roles...The first 2 two kids released were terrified of the assaulting media but loved the man with the gun...When all the kids are released>>>one walks back and says "Thank you SAM"...the stupid ass roof shooters shooting up "Big Indian Bob" in the middle of a great story being told by the man with the gun...Arguably, the best actor of the last 50 years, Dustin Hoffman is pure gold dust but Travolta shines magnificently and...a happy ending was impossible...The ultimate hostage taker is the media!

    The acting is marvelous. Every role is well-cast, and neither lead outshine their character(rather, they disappear nicely into the roles). It's engaging, and it comes across rather credible and psychologically accurate. The production is not flashy, nor does this feel "thrown together". Editing and cinematography are good. It's genuinely funny, here and there. The pacing is great, and this doesn't really lose your interest, as such. Heck, the children aren't even particularly irritating. So why do I give it that relatively low of a vote? Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of those who made it. 6/10

    Mad City is almost a remake of Billy Wilder's Ace In The Hole with a bit of Network thrown in. The Kirk Douglas part has shifted to a television reporter and it's played with relish by Dustin Hoffman. By sheer chance Hoffman is in the Museum Of Natural History when a security guard who's been laid off due to budget cuts, pulls a shotgun out of canvas bag and holds museum director Blythe Danner, a school teacher and her class who were out on a field trip just as the museum is closing. Oh and he accidentally shoots his former co-worker security guard Bill Nunn as well. That kind of seals his fate. As good as Dustin Hoffman is the film really belongs to John Travolta as the desperate security guard, a slow witted kind of man who really hasn't thought through what he's doing. Hoffman realizing he's got an exclusive story becomes Travolta's media adviser, stringing it out for all it's worth. Travolta has to walk a fine line in this film, balancing his character's situation in his portrayal. We empathize with him, many of us who have ever been desperate and without a paycheck, but we can't sympathize with a man who's holding a whole bunch of grade school kids hostage. Sam Bailey ranks as one of the two or three best pieces of work John Travolta has ever done. In the meantime Hoffman who is also mentoring young reporter Mia Kirshner, too well as it turns out, has also got a rivalry with network anchor Alan Alda. One thing I've noticed about Alan Alda, since he's left MASH, he's gone out of his way to take roles that are the farthest thing from good guy Hawkeye Pierce. He and Hoffman hate each other and Alda's attempts to spin the story his way and Hoffman's countermoves are what really set up the inevitable climax. Mad City is not very nice look at the news business and what people will do to get a story. The film has its roots not only in Ace In The Hole and Network, but you could make a case going all the way back to Five Star Final and other films showing the darker side of reporting and the agenda driven people in that business. Sad to say is that the news is business, show business in fact. In the end poor Travolta had to get off the stage.

It's engaging, and it comes across rather credible and psychologically accurate. The production is not flashy, nor does this feel "thrown together". Editing and cinematography are good. It's genuinely funny, here and there. The pacing is great, and this doesn't really lose your interest, as such. Heck, the children aren't even particularly irritating. So why do I give it that relatively low of a vote? Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of those who made it. 6/10

    Mad City is almost a remake of Billy Wilder's Ace In The Hole with a bit of Network thrown in. The Kirk Douglas part has shifted to a television reporter and it's played with relish by Dustin Hoffman. By sheer chance Hoffman is in the Museum Of Natural History when a security guard who's been laid off due to budget cuts, pulls a shotgun out of canvas bag and holds museum director Blythe Danner, a school teacher and her class who were out on a field trip just as the museum is closing. Oh and he accidentally shoots his former co-worker security guard Bill Nunn as well. That kind of seals his fate. As good as Dustin Hoffman is the film really belongs to John Travolta as the desperate security guard, a slow witted kind of man who really hasn't thought through what he's doing. Hoffman realizing he's got an exclusive story becomes Travolta's media adviser, stringing it out for all it's worth. Travolta has to walk a fine line in this film, balancing his character's situation in his portrayal. We empathize with him, many of us who have ever been desperate and without a paycheck, but we can't sympathize with a man who's holding a whole bunch of grade school kids hostage. Sam Bailey ranks as one of the two or three best pieces of work John Travolta has ever done. In the meantime Hoffman who is also mentoring young reporter Mia Kirshner, too well as it turns out, has also got a rivalry with network anchor Alan Alda. One thing I've noticed about Alan Alda, since he's left MASH, he's gone out of his way to take roles that are the farthest thing from good guy Hawkeye Pierce. He and Hoffman hate each other and Alda's attempts to spin the story his way and Hoffman's countermoves are what really set up the inevitable climax. Mad City is not very nice look at the news business and what people will do to get a story. The film has its roots not only in Ace In The Hole and Network, but you could make a case going all the way back to Five Star Final and other films showing the darker side of reporting and the agenda driven people in that business. Sad to say is that the news is business, show business in fact. In the end poor Travolta had to get off the stage.

    Mad City is one of those movies you see in the theater, possibly when you were younger and can remember seeing rated R movies as something of a kind of big deal, and then re-watch it on TV almost as a way to relive the experience as much as enjoy the movie. Then, as one gets older, re-watching the movie isn't quite the same if it isn't, well, very good. And yet even as Mad City isn't something I'd say to a friend "watch this right away, it'll change your life" (that, of course, from Costa-Gravas, would be Z), it's definitely a good view for something on a lazy day or night, or for a minor Dustin Hoffman or (yes) John Travolta craving. It does happen from time to time. The two stars are in very fine shape here- as far as the script can let them be- as a clear-headed but desperate reporter and a security guard with a heap of bad trouble respectively, who are put into an unintentional hostage situation after Travolta's recently fired museum security guard accidentally shoots a fellow guard and has to hold up a bunch of kids who are in the museum (plus Hoffman, in the bathroom after a boring interview while this happens), and then it turns into a media blitz. When these two actors interact the way they do, or even go through their somewhat predictable motions, it works at the least because we get to see Hoffman and Travolta as characters they've worked out and almost perfected in their own way. We believe them in this situation, and that should be enough to make it at least compelling viewing. ...Except, unfortunately, for a preachy screenplay, which half the time is simplistic tabloid entertainment and the other half dogmatic about the nature of the media. Costa-Gravas tries for moments that go for the satirical (one of my favorite bits is when we see the shot security guard recovering in his hospital room, waking up the first time to see a giant camera crane rising outside of his window to get his reaction to seeing a giant camera crane from a news group). It's definitely 20 years too late: Network got their first, quicker, brighter, funnier, and even with some better action. Perhaps there would have been more possibilities if the movie had been made today, when cable news is even more saturated with BS filler, one analysis to the next taking up time from actual other news that could be reported. But, for complaints that can be had with Mad City, and there are more than a few, it's surely watchable Hollywood stuff, and this is thanks to the direction (I really liked the tension when Travolta is telling the kids the Indian ghost story in front of the display in the museum), and a nice roster of supporting/character actors. If you've never seen a Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta movie before, by all means look elsewhere. But if you got nothing better to do, it isn't bad.

    Underrated, that is for sure. I was shocked at the low ratting of this film on IMDb and also that no one had said, "hey you have to see this movie". I think John Travolta gives one of his best performances and Dustin Hoffman is amazing as always and also a great supporting cast. Sure this film does not have the intensity of other films with it's same basic concepts but that is what makes it unique. I find it interesting that most movie critic reviews of this film are not very good, it makes me wonder if that has something to do with it's content. The film focuses on the media and the harm it is capable of causing by at times stirring the pot or reporting then news the way they want it be seen. So movie critics who are part of the media, for the most part hate this film, hmmm? Anyway a great film with great performances that deserved way more attention and praise then it has received.

    I thought this was an excellent movie! It is of course excellent because it has two fantastic actors in it: John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman. They are spectacular actors and whoever decide to put them in the same movie is a pure genius!! When i was reading about it i didn't think it would be my type of movie (even though John Travolta is my favorite actor!) but when i did watch it i thought it was great! Although i was very sad at the end when Sam commits suicide, his poor wife and family but that shows what a splendid actor John Travolta is,he really makes you feel sorry for him even when its not real. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful actor as well and i really think this movie should get some sort of award because it was outstanding!! My hat goes off to John Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and The director!!

    Albeit something of a spoiler, this film ends somewhat like "Soylent Green" in which the protagonist screams "Soylent Green is people!" to awaken and reveal a relevant truth; and so too does the character of Max Bracket, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in an awesomely tragic and long crane shot declare: "WE KILLED HIM, WE KILLED SAM!" as a throng and horde of media and on-lookers engulf him. This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. "Mad City" shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects. "Mad City" therefore, should be compulsory viewing for all Mass Comm majors for it shows how egos can overpower what should be the real impetus behind the news: the pursuit of the truth, and not sensationalism.

    Although they tend to criticize them and to find their weak spots... As there is touch competition and rivalry in (private) networks, persons with high ambition and need for fame and glory are eager to exploit any person and item for their own benefit. Mostly it is comical, but at times it takes serious or event tragic scope - when/if innocent people, victims or their families are involved. And in the era of online search engines, it is impossible to leave things behind and move on with their lives. The duo Dustin Hoffman - John Travolta is brilliant, at least 2 additional points from me because of them. Other actors are good as well. As for Costa-Cavras, he has directed better stuff: there are twists and turns, but tension is sometimes falling, and those almost two hours are too much for this story. The ending is predictable as well. Nevertheless, Mad City is deserves more attention and bigger ratings than it has achieved. It is no family entertainment, however.

    A down with luck TV reporter (Dustin Hoffman) has the gold chance of his life when he finds the story of a lifetime while covering a hostage situation in a museum. John Travolta plays a fired security who held several kids and a museum director (Blythe Danner) as hostages simply because he wanted his job back. Max Brackett, the reporter, was there doing a small report about the place when everything started right on his front. Here stars the story of "Mad City" and some ponderations on the media role and the ones who watch it, which means, us! Wisely translated in Portuguese as "The Fourth Power" the film directed by Costa Gavras ("Missing", "Z") is satirical without being extremely funny or ridiculous; dramatical without becoming melodramatic; and controversial without being too shocking; criticizes but not that much, pointing its fingers on the media blaming it for being irresponsible and unethical, but where's the criticism towards audiences of this fourth power? Everybody (or almost everybody because every unanimity is dumb) loves sensationalistic journalism and its wide coverage of pointless subjects, sometimes very relevant news. People are very hunger for that and most of the time they don't even care if a sensational news story is true or false. And the media, in countries where it is the fourth power (behind the legislative, executive and judiciary) takes advantage of that, fooling people (but only the ones who want to be fooled or are too ignorant to have a better perspective). So in the film Brackett gets his lesson at the end, but what about the viewers? Most of them didn't get it all, that's why this film is bad criticized and barely heard. And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like "Network" or "Ace in the Hole" this film pales a little in comparison. It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word "City", yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others. The cult status will take a while to be deserved by "Mad City". 10/10

    Costa Gavras' "Mad City" sees actor Dustin Hoffman playing Max Brackett, a television reporter who uses a recent news story to boost his own career. The news story? A recently laid-off security guard returns to the museum at which he worked in an attempt to get his job back. When his former boss (the unsubtly named Mrs Banks) refuses his demands, the security guard goes berserk and holds the entire museum, which is filled with school children, hostage. The film is derivative of Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network", Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" and William Wellman's "Magic Town", but nevertheless goes in some interesting directions. For example, the film uses the Natural History Museum in an ironic fashion, the world of history bulldozed by media, America a soul deadened prison reliant on sensationalized news stories and a constant trickle of crass reports to drum up excitement. The kids held hostage are themselves unfazed, their lives a gun filled television show even before the news vans pulled up. 6.5/10  All of Costa Gavras' Hollywood films are weaker than his foreign language films, but this one is the weakest. Overlong, and badly acted, "Mad City" nevertheless manages to be at once dumber and more complex than its generally given credit. I attribute this paradox to magic.

    I think infinity is the number to which I approach...listing reasons to like this movie. Before I forget the "likeable, trustworthy" Alan Anchor Alda is equal to Walter Cronkite after the oil slick. The evolution of the little girl assistant to Dustin Hoffman...at end wearing red lipstick to match Dustin's blood...if you were to subtract from film all unnecessary dialog/footage you would equal absolute zero. Robert Proskey was born into such roles...The first 2 two kids released were terrified of the assaulting media but loved the man with the gun...When all the kids are released>>>one walks back and says "Thank you SAM"...the stupid ass roof shooters shooting up "Big Indian Bob" in the middle of a great story being told by the man with the gun...Arguably, the best actor of the last 50 years, Dustin Hoffman is pure gold dust but Travolta shines magnificently and...a happy ending was impossible...The ultimate hostage taker is the media!

And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like "Network" or "Ace in the Hole" this film pales a little in comparison. It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word "City", yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others. The cult status will take a while to be deserved by "Mad City". 10/10

    Costa Gavras' "Mad City" sees actor Dustin Hoffman playing Max Brackett, a television reporter who uses a recent news story to boost his own career. The news story? A recently laid-off security guard returns to the museum at which he worked in an attempt to get his job back. When his former boss (the unsubtly named Mrs Banks) refuses his demands, the security guard goes berserk and holds the entire museum, which is filled with school children, hostage. The film is derivative of Lumet's "Dog Day Afternoon" and "Network", Billy Wilder's "Ace in the Hole" and William Wellman's "Magic Town", but nevertheless goes in some interesting directions. For example, the film uses the Natural History Museum in an ironic fashion, the world of history bulldozed by media, America a soul deadened prison reliant on sensationalized news stories and a constant trickle of crass reports to drum up excitement. The kids held hostage are themselves unfazed, their lives a gun filled television show even before the news vans pulled up. 6.5/10  All of Costa Gavras' Hollywood films are weaker than his foreign language films, but this one is the weakest. Overlong, and badly acted, "Mad City" nevertheless manages to be at once dumber and more complex than its generally given credit. I attribute this paradox to magic.

    I think infinity is the number to which I approach...listing reasons to like this movie. Before I forget the "likeable, trustworthy" Alan Anchor Alda is equal to Walter Cronkite after the oil slick. The evolution of the little girl assistant to Dustin Hoffman...at end wearing red lipstick to match Dustin's blood...if you were to subtract from film all unnecessary dialog/footage you would equal absolute zero. Robert Proskey was born into such roles...The first 2 two kids released were terrified of the assaulting media but loved the man with the gun...When all the kids are released>>>one walks back and says "Thank you SAM"...the stupid ass roof shooters shooting up "Big Indian Bob" in the middle of a great story being told by the man with the gun...Arguably, the best actor of the last 50 years, Dustin Hoffman is pure gold dust but Travolta shines magnificently and...a happy ending was impossible...The ultimate hostage taker is the media!

    The acting is marvelous. Every role is well-cast, and neither lead outshine their character(rather, they disappear nicely into the roles). It's engaging, and it comes across rather credible and psychologically accurate. The production is not flashy, nor does this feel "thrown together". Editing and cinematography are good. It's genuinely funny, here and there. The pacing is great, and this doesn't really lose your interest, as such. Heck, the children aren't even particularly irritating. So why do I give it that relatively low of a vote? Well, frankly, it seems to put forth all it really has to say within the first fifteen to twenty minutes, and after that, it simply keeps restating it, occasionally in a different way than earlier in the movie. The one message that this contains is that the press can and will blow things out of proportion, and manipulate facts as well as those who follow them in order to stay informed. As admirable as it is to make an effort to ensure that everyone is aware of that sad truth, don't we all already know that? If this would at least explore it, go into what has led to it, and what makes people go along with it, it would quite possibly make for excellent cinema. As it is, this honestly winds up being a one-sided attempt at convincing its audience that things are a certain way, no matter what else they might believe, which is, ironically, exactly like the type of news-reporting that it is trying to decry. While 15 Minutes wasn't a masterpiece, it at least had satire, and was more entertaining than this. There is some violence and brief language in this. I recommend this to the biggest fans of those who made it. 6/10

    Mad City is almost a remake of Billy Wilder's Ace In The Hole with a bit of Network thrown in. The Kirk Douglas part has shifted to a television reporter and it's played with relish by Dustin Hoffman. By sheer chance Hoffman is in the Museum Of Natural History when a security guard who's been laid off due to budget cuts, pulls a shotgun out of canvas bag and holds museum director Blythe Danner, a school teacher and her class who were out on a field trip just as the museum is closing. Oh and he accidentally shoots his former co-worker security guard Bill Nunn as well. That kind of seals his fate. As good as Dustin Hoffman is the film really belongs to John Travolta as the desperate security guard, a slow witted kind of man who really hasn't thought through what he's doing. Hoffman realizing he's got an exclusive story becomes Travolta's media adviser, stringing it out for all it's worth. Travolta has to walk a fine line in this film, balancing his character's situation in his portrayal. We empathize with him, many of us who have ever been desperate and without a paycheck, but we can't sympathize with a man who's holding a whole bunch of grade school kids hostage. Sam Bailey ranks as one of the two or three best pieces of work John Travolta has ever done. In the meantime Hoffman who is also mentoring young reporter Mia Kirshner, too well as it turns out, has also got a rivalry with network anchor Alan Alda. One thing I've noticed about Alan Alda, since he's left MASH, he's gone out of his way to take roles that are the farthest thing from good guy Hawkeye Pierce. He and Hoffman hate each other and Alda's attempts to spin the story his way and Hoffman's countermoves are what really set up the inevitable climax. Mad City is not very nice look at the news business and what people will do to get a story. The film has its roots not only in Ace In The Hole and Network, but you could make a case going all the way back to Five Star Final and other films showing the darker side of reporting and the agenda driven people in that business. Sad to say is that the news is business, show business in fact. In the end poor Travolta had to get off the stage.

    Mad City is one of those movies you see in the theater, possibly when you were younger and can remember seeing rated R movies as something of a kind of big deal, and then re-watch it on TV almost as a way to relive the experience as much as enjoy the movie. Then, as one gets older, re-watching the movie isn't quite the same if it isn't, well, very good. And yet even as Mad City isn't something I'd say to a friend "watch this right away, it'll change your life" (that, of course, from Costa-Gravas, would be Z), it's definitely a good view for something on a lazy day or night, or for a minor Dustin Hoffman or (yes) John Travolta craving. It does happen from time to time. The two stars are in very fine shape here- as far as the script can let them be- as a clear-headed but desperate reporter and a security guard with a heap of bad trouble respectively, who are put into an unintentional hostage situation after Travolta's recently fired museum security guard accidentally shoots a fellow guard and has to hold up a bunch of kids who are in the museum (plus Hoffman, in the bathroom after a boring interview while this happens), and then it turns into a media blitz. When these two actors interact the way they do, or even go through their somewhat predictable motions, it works at the least because we get to see Hoffman and Travolta as characters they've worked out and almost perfected in their own way. We believe them in this situation, and that should be enough to make it at least compelling viewing. ...Except, unfortunately, for a preachy screenplay, which half the time is simplistic tabloid entertainment and the other half dogmatic about the nature of the media. Costa-Gravas tries for moments that go for the satirical (one of my favorite bits is when we see the shot security guard recovering in his hospital room, waking up the first time to see a giant camera crane rising outside of his window to get his reaction to seeing a giant camera crane from a news group). It's definitely 20 years too late: Network got their first, quicker, brighter, funnier, and even with some better action. Perhaps there would have been more possibilities if the movie had been made today, when cable news is even more saturated with BS filler, one analysis to the next taking up time from actual other news that could be reported. But, for complaints that can be had with Mad City, and there are more than a few, it's surely watchable Hollywood stuff, and this is thanks to the direction (I really liked the tension when Travolta is telling the kids the Indian ghost story in front of the display in the museum), and a nice roster of supporting/character actors. If you've never seen a Dustin Hoffman or John Travolta movie before, by all means look elsewhere. But if you got nothing better to do, it isn't bad.

    Underrated, that is for sure. I was shocked at the low ratting of this film on IMDb and also that no one had said, "hey you have to see this movie". I think John Travolta gives one of his best performances and Dustin Hoffman is amazing as always and also a great supporting cast. Sure this film does not have the intensity of other films with it's same basic concepts but that is what makes it unique. I find it interesting that most movie critic reviews of this film are not very good, it makes me wonder if that has something to do with it's content. The film focuses on the media and the harm it is capable of causing by at times stirring the pot or reporting then news the way they want it be seen. So movie critics who are part of the media, for the most part hate this film, hmmm? Anyway a great film with great performances that deserved way more attention and praise then it has received.

    I thought this was an excellent movie! It is of course excellent because it has two fantastic actors in it: John Travolta and Dustin Hoffman. They are spectacular actors and whoever decide to put them in the same movie is a pure genius!! When i was reading about it i didn't think it would be my type of movie (even though John Travolta is my favorite actor!) but when i did watch it i thought it was great! Although i was very sad at the end when Sam commits suicide, his poor wife and family but that shows what a splendid actor John Travolta is,he really makes you feel sorry for him even when its not real. Dustin Hoffman is a wonderful actor as well and i really think this movie should get some sort of award because it was outstanding!! My hat goes off to John Travolta, Dustin Hoffman and The director!!

    Albeit something of a spoiler, this film ends somewhat like "Soylent Green" in which the protagonist screams "Soylent Green is people!" to awaken and reveal a relevant truth; and so too does the character of Max Bracket, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in an awesomely tragic and long crane shot declare: "WE KILLED HIM, WE KILLED SAM!" as a throng and horde of media and on-lookers engulf him. This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. "Mad City" shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects. "Mad City" therefore, should be compulsory viewing for all Mass Comm majors for it shows how egos can overpower what should be the real impetus behind the news: the pursuit of the truth, and not sensationalism.

    Although they tend to criticize them and to find their weak spots... As there is touch competition and rivalry in (private) networks, persons with high ambition and need for fame and glory are eager to exploit any person and item for their own benefit. Mostly it is comical, but at times it takes serious or event tragic scope - when/if innocent people, victims or their families are involved. And in the era of online search engines, it is impossible to leave things behind and move on with their lives. The duo Dustin Hoffman - John Travolta is brilliant, at least 2 additional points from me because of them. Other actors are good as well. As for Costa-Cavras, he has directed better stuff: there are twists and turns, but tension is sometimes falling, and those almost two hours are too much for this story. The ending is predictable as well. Nevertheless, Mad City is deserves more attention and bigger ratings than it has achieved. It is no family entertainment, however.

    A down with luck TV reporter (Dustin Hoffman) has the gold chance of his life when he finds the story of a lifetime while covering a hostage situation in a museum. John Travolta plays a fired security who held several kids and a museum director (Blythe Danner) as hostages simply because he wanted his job back. Max Brackett, the reporter, was there doing a small report about the place when everything started right on his front. Here stars the story of "Mad City" and some ponderations on the media role and the ones who watch it, which means, us! Wisely translated in Portuguese as "The Fourth Power" the film directed by Costa Gavras ("Missing", "Z") is satirical without being extremely funny or ridiculous; dramatical without becoming melodramatic; and controversial without being too shocking; criticizes but not that much, pointing its fingers on the media blaming it for being irresponsible and unethical, but where's the criticism towards audiences of this fourth power? Everybody (or almost everybody because every unanimity is dumb) loves sensationalistic journalism and its wide coverage of pointless subjects, sometimes very relevant news. People are very hunger for that and most of the time they don't even care if a sensational news story is true or false. And the media, in countries where it is the fourth power (behind the legislative, executive and judiciary) takes advantage of that, fooling people (but only the ones who want to be fooled or are too ignorant to have a better perspective). So in the film Brackett gets his lesson at the end, but what about the viewers? Most of them didn't get it all, that's why this film is bad criticized and barely heard. And how come a movie that attacks the whole media and press can be well judged or be a box-office hit? People are blind to these things. But when you have masterpieces like "Network" or "Ace in the Hole" this film pales a little in comparison. It might not have the same ferocity and originality as his works but it is a great work directed by Costa Gavras, with a great screenplay, nice music and fine acting by Hoffman (who now disowned the film in interviews calling of something I can post here referring to the word "City", yes, he does that with what he calls his bad films, go figure!), Travolta, Blythe Danner, Alan Alda, Ted Levine, Raymond J. Barry, William Atherton, Robert Prosky, Mia Kershner and Bill Nunn. I like this film a lot, it should have a larger audience to it, but it looks like it will be almost impossible to bring more attention to it, or a reevaluation by film buff's, critics and others. The cult status will take a while to be deserved by "Mad City". 10/10

    Albeit something of a spoiler, this film ends somewhat like "Soylent Green" in which the protagonist screams "Soylent Green is people!" to awaken and reveal a relevant truth; and so too does the character of Max Bracket, portrayed by Dustin Hoffman in an awesomely tragic and long crane shot declare: "WE KILLED HIM, WE KILLED SAM!" as a throng and horde of media and on-lookers engulf him. This film is a biting indictment of the media circus that we look upon as Network and Cable news, and it shows how one story, the story of a simple yet complex man can be manipulated to fit the needs of those manipulating the supposedly objective nature of the news. "Mad City" shows that there is no such thing as objective reporting, or even loyalty amongst reporters, and that integrity rests with the subjective individualists such as Max Bracket who seem to have the bottom line of a scoop in their best interest, but whose humanness and ethicality cause them to care and empathize with their subjects. "Mad City" therefore, should be compulsory viewing for all Mass Comm majors for it shows how egos can overpower what should be the real impetus behind the news: the pursuit of the truth, and not sensationalism.
