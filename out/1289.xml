    That's what it felt like. Maybe that was the intent. It wasn't too hard to fill in the blanks at times but if the story isn't a mystery or something, a viewer should have to try and fill in the blanks as often as this movie required. The toughest character to figure out was William. Was he a bum? Wasn't he? When he left how wasn't he a bum anymore? And telling the time frame was a bit difficult at times too. Oh well. It wasn't awful but I doubt I'd watch it more than once. The ending was rather predictable. Not that that's totally awful in a movie like this. You don't see a romcom with the intent of some majorly drastic plot twist. And yeah, they should give a better warning about the language. Netflix rates it PG but that is not US PS language.

    There are several reasons why I wanted to see Jack & Sarah, and a couple of them are to do with one or two of the cast members. I am a huge fan of Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, and when I saw they were going to be in the same film together, I thought to myself this movie is going to be good! Overall, I was not disappointed. Some parts are slow, but the acting more than made up for it. Tim Sullivan's direction ensured that the film didn't get too sentimental, though some of it is very sweet and poignant, and the script is honest and touching. Jack & Sarah is very nice to look at too, the cinematography and scenery are both lovely, and the music is very warm and inviting. But the real delight is the acting; Richard E.Grant is very good as the high-flying lawyer/bumbling father figure, while Samantha Mathis is appealing as the nanny who falls for her employer. However, Ian McKellen as the tramp-cum-butler in a class of his own and Judi Dench as Margaret are the ones who steal the show, while Eileen Atkins gives terrific support. Overall, very nice and charming film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Amazing moments of bitter sweetness and a 180&deg; turn around for Richard E Grant from Withnail and the frankly strange How to get ahead in Advertising made this memorable. With a winning story of a widower, a baby, and an American girl this is much better than routine storyline - it has a very good support cast with Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, and the wonderful Eileen Aitkens who should have become a household name as Dame Dench as done. Scene after scene that are all memorable and some excellent comedy moments this is truly a heartwarming film and a real treasure. Not just a comedy it tackles wider issues like grief with alacrity and Samantha Mathis and Grant have the right chemistry. If you've never seen it I would recommend it, and if you have seen it it's worth seeing again: it holds up very well.

    Horrific acting, except from all supporting actors and the baby. Richard E. Grant is just too hard to watch, not hideously bad, just hard to watch. His kitschy and formulaic approach to the character is somewhat embarrassing (and his haircut is beyond awful--where was the make-up dept anyway!!?? 1995 or not, it was hideous). Samantha Mathis definitely shouldn't be sharing any scenes with the likes of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, or Ian McKellan. Mathis is incredibly hard to watch as it is, then when she shares scenes with all of the above it just makes her look BEYOND FOOLISH. It was almost like watching a "scene study" exercise in acting class, where you feel incredibly sorry for the girl in the scene because she just isn't believable and is truly hard to watch. Mathis is beyond lucky to be acting opposite Dench, Atkins and McKellan. Almost as though someone pulled some "favor" to get her into this film. There are so many thousands of other talented American actresses who would have made this character so much more brilliant! What a total disaster, and tragedy of wasted celluloid. The only reason to watch this movie is for the supporting cast. For that matter, it seems that the supporting cast members were the only reason this movie could have been produced in the first place. With a terribly weak script, BAD BAD BAD lead actors, and trite resolution to the story who would sink money into this without the assurance of some real acting talent. It's truly amazing what a McKellan, Dench, and Atkins can make possible. Leave the real acting to the real actors next time! Please!

    This potentially heart-rending tale of one man's tragic loss and his attempt to go on with life is without the necessary emotional impact and dramatic power to really work. "Jack and Sarah" tries to encompass too many genres, swinging as it does from near satire to near pathos without warning, leaving the viewer more surprised than moved. Our writer/director Tim Sullivan appears to prepare us for an unorthodox comedy about starting a family, then hits us with a bombshell that causes the plot to make a complete about face. During the course of the film more about faces are incorporated (not blended) which serves only to tantalise, but not fulfil, the audience's emotions. Still, in this light it is something different - British of course - from the usual romantic-comedies being churned out these days. Richard E. Grant slides comfortably into the role of the dad who doesn't seem to know when he's on a good thing. A most enjoyable turn from an agreeable actor. In support of him is the evergreen Judi Dench, as his sour old mum, and Imogen Stubbs, as his tragic wife. Samantha Mathis is the other completely disarming lead, playing the young American lass who takes an immediate shining to baby Sarah, and promptly signs up as Jack's nanny. Certainly "Jack and Sarah" could have been an unforgettable, emotionally powerful drama. However the light, almost aloof manner that has been adopted here leaves a distinct British feel to this pic, but gives it no chance of becoming dramatically moving. Thankfully a change, yet falls short of its potential. Saturday, February 3, 1996 - Astor Theatre

    Originally written by UK sitcom writer Tim O'Sullivan, Jack and Sarah is one of the very best British films that graced British cinema. The story begins with couple Jack and Sarah getting all loved up, Sarah then goes into labour and her husband, who panics, has to drive her to the hospital. Eventually, she gives birth to a healthy and beautiful baby daughter, much to the delight of Jack. Unfortunately, joy turns to anguish when Sarah dies during the childbirth, devastating Jack in the process. As a single parent, he faces a somewhat un daunting task of looking after his daughter, of whom he names Sarah whilst at the same time juggling his work responsibilities. Luckily for him, he meets an American woman named Amy, who earns her living as a waitress and thus, he hires her as his babysitter, much to the disapproval of Jack's mother played by Dame Judy Dench and so-called bum-turned butler played by Sir Ian McKellan. Thus, it isn't long before a romantic sub-plot involving Amy and Jack develops later on. Although the scheming Anna- Jack's boss, does go to great lengths to snake-charm her way into Jack's affections. Whilst Amy is sweet, down-to-earth and considerate, Anna comes across as rather self-centred, selfish and somewhat a nasty piece of work. The story very much centres on the relationship between Jack and Amy and the realisation that they are in love with one another, hence the transition from workers to eventual lovers. Samantha Mathis successfully manages to convey a quality in Amy that makes us want to like her and after her appearance in that awful Super Mario Brothers movie, she has redeemed herself in this movie. Jack and Sarah is a film with a very simple plot that is easy to understand, and yet its the performances by the two actors Grant and Mathis that make it a very good film overall. It's sentimental-yet still pleasing to eye, and though whilst this film deals with the issue of fatherhood and being a single parent, the romantic sub-plot involving Jack and Amy still plays an important part in the film, by means of which it implies that whilst being a single father, one doesn't have to give up hope in finding love and in falling in love with that person. Which is what happened with Jack and Amy. In all, it is well-written, well directed with a good cast and though whilst I am not a huge fan of Brit flicks, Jack and Sarah is extremely good. Highly recommended.

    One of the strengths of this film is its subtlety. The first ten or fifteen minutes are a great example. Few words are needed yet volumes of emotion are communicated through those scenes. Another - later - example is where Jack and his father are in the park when it's snowing. The weather seems to exaggerate the raw, emotional pain Jack is going through but no words are needed because the viewer knows exactly what he is feeling. The scene where the grief hits Jack is very poignant - he has been almost in a trance until then, trying to carry on as normal and yet what finally gets him in touch with his grief for Sarah is the almost ordinary combination of her lipstick on the wine glass and her voice on the answerphone. He tried to be so prepared, so involved in his wife's pregnancy but never came close to being prepared for the real outcome. I hate to say it, but there are points during Jack's early mourning period where the character comes across as what I believe non-English people think of the stereotypical Englishman - blocking out any emotion. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of the story starting when it does - we don't get any idea of what he was like before his wife Sarah was pregnant. The baby next to the sleeping Jack is an interesting metaphor. At that point, both are helpless in their own way, both only in tune with their own feelings, but baby Sarah at least has the excuse of not knowing any better. Jack's selfishness is entirely self-induced. There are some interesting attempts to explode stereotypes, which I think should be applauded. The characterisation of Jack's boss Anna is interesting - the assumption that just because she is female, she will be more sympathetic would be natural but she comes across as so work-driven that she almost becomes heartless. I think Jack is a bit overwhelmed by Anna, perhaps too much so - there are moments when she is quite cutting and when Jack would be right to correct her. There is a curious comparison with Amy, who - although superficially like other females in that she cooes over Sarah - is sufficiently vague at first that she doesn't even notice which sex baby Sarah is. Jack also tackles another himself over the issue of whether he can use the nursing mothers' room to change Sarah's nappy. In keeping with the theme of stereotypes, it is interesting how the opinions of the other characters try to influence the main ones. Jack's mum thinks Anna is outwardly great for him when she is really a selfish character, while Amy - who is a far kinder person - is written off as a "dreadful American girl". The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them. On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

    A curious film. Patently chasing the golden goose formula of Four Weddings and a Funeral this comic film is replete with genuine tragedy, an American girl and a fairly top-drawer British cast. Indeed the film succeeds effortlessly when the actors have a reasonable chunk of script or scene to work with (with the exception of the mediocre Samantha Mathis). I also really enjoyed the fluid comedy, moving between the obvious and the surprising, equally well delivered by the ensemble. The film falls down though in its rather piecemeal approach. There's a feeling, almost literally, of the film being put together as if by marketeering scientists, looking to maximise its impact. There any number of bizarrely framed shots and loose ends - the set piece is king at the expense of overall cohesion. 4/10 but, hang on, I was conspicuously aware of it not being written or directed by Richard Curtis, so 5/10 for avoiding clone status.

    The casting being one of them. Richard E Grant, playing Jack is the first twist, a crazy workaholic type who likes to control everything and is completely narcissistic, witness him going through labour pains at the prenatal course. Jack is extremely unlikable, so much so that his pregnant wife, in an aside, whispers to her unborn baby that single parenthood might be ahead. Shift to the childbirth and the unfortunate death of the mother. Jack dissolves into morose alcoholism and narcissistic isolation. How Jack slowly evolves into something resembling a caring human being is the crux of the story. The supporting cast is amazing - Ian Maclellan, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins - and they add points to a movie I would have rated below a 5 without them. Samantha Mathis tries but doesn't quite engage. We never know enough about her to care, apart from her infatuation with a guy who's bonking her best friend. I understand that Stephen Rea turned down the part of Jack and I would have preferred his tired jadedness in the role. Jack has a horror-movie type mania that jolts too much at times, I would seriously be reluctant to let him alone with a baby anything. Material has been done many times, but a nice twist at the end too. The main romance was so predictable, but so are they all in movies of this type. We go to them for no surprises, just the warm, slightly cloying fuzzies at the end. 6 out of 10.

The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them. On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

    A curious film. Patently chasing the golden goose formula of Four Weddings and a Funeral this comic film is replete with genuine tragedy, an American girl and a fairly top-drawer British cast. Indeed the film succeeds effortlessly when the actors have a reasonable chunk of script or scene to work with (with the exception of the mediocre Samantha Mathis). I also really enjoyed the fluid comedy, moving between the obvious and the surprising, equally well delivered by the ensemble. The film falls down though in its rather piecemeal approach. There's a feeling, almost literally, of the film being put together as if by marketeering scientists, looking to maximise its impact. There any number of bizarrely framed shots and loose ends - the set piece is king at the expense of overall cohesion. 4/10 but, hang on, I was conspicuously aware of it not being written or directed by Richard Curtis, so 5/10 for avoiding clone status.

    The casting being one of them. Richard E Grant, playing Jack is the first twist, a crazy workaholic type who likes to control everything and is completely narcissistic, witness him going through labour pains at the prenatal course. Jack is extremely unlikable, so much so that his pregnant wife, in an aside, whispers to her unborn baby that single parenthood might be ahead. Shift to the childbirth and the unfortunate death of the mother. Jack dissolves into morose alcoholism and narcissistic isolation. How Jack slowly evolves into something resembling a caring human being is the crux of the story. The supporting cast is amazing - Ian Maclellan, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins - and they add points to a movie I would have rated below a 5 without them. Samantha Mathis tries but doesn't quite engage. We never know enough about her to care, apart from her infatuation with a guy who's bonking her best friend. I understand that Stephen Rea turned down the part of Jack and I would have preferred his tired jadedness in the role. Jack has a horror-movie type mania that jolts too much at times, I would seriously be reluctant to let him alone with a baby anything. Material has been done many times, but a nice twist at the end too. The main romance was so predictable, but so are they all in movies of this type. We go to them for no surprises, just the warm, slightly cloying fuzzies at the end. 6 out of 10.

    That's what it felt like. Maybe that was the intent. It wasn't too hard to fill in the blanks at times but if the story isn't a mystery or something, a viewer should have to try and fill in the blanks as often as this movie required. The toughest character to figure out was William. Was he a bum? Wasn't he? When he left how wasn't he a bum anymore? And telling the time frame was a bit difficult at times too. Oh well. It wasn't awful but I doubt I'd watch it more than once. The ending was rather predictable. Not that that's totally awful in a movie like this. You don't see a romcom with the intent of some majorly drastic plot twist. And yeah, they should give a better warning about the language. Netflix rates it PG but that is not US PS language.

    There are several reasons why I wanted to see Jack & Sarah, and a couple of them are to do with one or two of the cast members. I am a huge fan of Ian McKellen and Judi Dench, and when I saw they were going to be in the same film together, I thought to myself this movie is going to be good! Overall, I was not disappointed. Some parts are slow, but the acting more than made up for it. Tim Sullivan's direction ensured that the film didn't get too sentimental, though some of it is very sweet and poignant, and the script is honest and touching. Jack & Sarah is very nice to look at too, the cinematography and scenery are both lovely, and the music is very warm and inviting. But the real delight is the acting; Richard E.Grant is very good as the high-flying lawyer/bumbling father figure, while Samantha Mathis is appealing as the nanny who falls for her employer. However, Ian McKellen as the tramp-cum-butler in a class of his own and Judi Dench as Margaret are the ones who steal the show, while Eileen Atkins gives terrific support. Overall, very nice and charming film. 8/10 Bethany Cox

    Amazing moments of bitter sweetness and a 180&deg; turn around for Richard E Grant from Withnail and the frankly strange How to get ahead in Advertising made this memorable. With a winning story of a widower, a baby, and an American girl this is much better than routine storyline - it has a very good support cast with Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, and the wonderful Eileen Aitkens who should have become a household name as Dame Dench as done. Scene after scene that are all memorable and some excellent comedy moments this is truly a heartwarming film and a real treasure. Not just a comedy it tackles wider issues like grief with alacrity and Samantha Mathis and Grant have the right chemistry. If you've never seen it I would recommend it, and if you have seen it it's worth seeing again: it holds up very well.

    Horrific acting, except from all supporting actors and the baby. Richard E. Grant is just too hard to watch, not hideously bad, just hard to watch. His kitschy and formulaic approach to the character is somewhat embarrassing (and his haircut is beyond awful--where was the make-up dept anyway!!?? 1995 or not, it was hideous). Samantha Mathis definitely shouldn't be sharing any scenes with the likes of Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins, or Ian McKellan. Mathis is incredibly hard to watch as it is, then when she shares scenes with all of the above it just makes her look BEYOND FOOLISH. It was almost like watching a "scene study" exercise in acting class, where you feel incredibly sorry for the girl in the scene because she just isn't believable and is truly hard to watch. Mathis is beyond lucky to be acting opposite Dench, Atkins and McKellan. Almost as though someone pulled some "favor" to get her into this film. There are so many thousands of other talented American actresses who would have made this character so much more brilliant! What a total disaster, and tragedy of wasted celluloid. The only reason to watch this movie is for the supporting cast. For that matter, it seems that the supporting cast members were the only reason this movie could have been produced in the first place. With a terribly weak script, BAD BAD BAD lead actors, and trite resolution to the story who would sink money into this without the assurance of some real acting talent. It's truly amazing what a McKellan, Dench, and Atkins can make possible. Leave the real acting to the real actors next time! Please!

    This potentially heart-rending tale of one man's tragic loss and his attempt to go on with life is without the necessary emotional impact and dramatic power to really work. "Jack and Sarah" tries to encompass too many genres, swinging as it does from near satire to near pathos without warning, leaving the viewer more surprised than moved. Our writer/director Tim Sullivan appears to prepare us for an unorthodox comedy about starting a family, then hits us with a bombshell that causes the plot to make a complete about face. During the course of the film more about faces are incorporated (not blended) which serves only to tantalise, but not fulfil, the audience's emotions. Still, in this light it is something different - British of course - from the usual romantic-comedies being churned out these days. Richard E. Grant slides comfortably into the role of the dad who doesn't seem to know when he's on a good thing. A most enjoyable turn from an agreeable actor. In support of him is the evergreen Judi Dench, as his sour old mum, and Imogen Stubbs, as his tragic wife. Samantha Mathis is the other completely disarming lead, playing the young American lass who takes an immediate shining to baby Sarah, and promptly signs up as Jack's nanny. Certainly "Jack and Sarah" could have been an unforgettable, emotionally powerful drama. However the light, almost aloof manner that has been adopted here leaves a distinct British feel to this pic, but gives it no chance of becoming dramatically moving. Thankfully a change, yet falls short of its potential. Saturday, February 3, 1996 - Astor Theatre

    Originally written by UK sitcom writer Tim O'Sullivan, Jack and Sarah is one of the very best British films that graced British cinema. The story begins with couple Jack and Sarah getting all loved up, Sarah then goes into labour and her husband, who panics, has to drive her to the hospital. Eventually, she gives birth to a healthy and beautiful baby daughter, much to the delight of Jack. Unfortunately, joy turns to anguish when Sarah dies during the childbirth, devastating Jack in the process. As a single parent, he faces a somewhat un daunting task of looking after his daughter, of whom he names Sarah whilst at the same time juggling his work responsibilities. Luckily for him, he meets an American woman named Amy, who earns her living as a waitress and thus, he hires her as his babysitter, much to the disapproval of Jack's mother played by Dame Judy Dench and so-called bum-turned butler played by Sir Ian McKellan. Thus, it isn't long before a romantic sub-plot involving Amy and Jack develops later on. Although the scheming Anna- Jack's boss, does go to great lengths to snake-charm her way into Jack's affections. Whilst Amy is sweet, down-to-earth and considerate, Anna comes across as rather self-centred, selfish and somewhat a nasty piece of work. The story very much centres on the relationship between Jack and Amy and the realisation that they are in love with one another, hence the transition from workers to eventual lovers. Samantha Mathis successfully manages to convey a quality in Amy that makes us want to like her and after her appearance in that awful Super Mario Brothers movie, she has redeemed herself in this movie. Jack and Sarah is a film with a very simple plot that is easy to understand, and yet its the performances by the two actors Grant and Mathis that make it a very good film overall. It's sentimental-yet still pleasing to eye, and though whilst this film deals with the issue of fatherhood and being a single parent, the romantic sub-plot involving Jack and Amy still plays an important part in the film, by means of which it implies that whilst being a single father, one doesn't have to give up hope in finding love and in falling in love with that person. Which is what happened with Jack and Amy. In all, it is well-written, well directed with a good cast and though whilst I am not a huge fan of Brit flicks, Jack and Sarah is extremely good. Highly recommended.

    One of the strengths of this film is its subtlety. The first ten or fifteen minutes are a great example. Few words are needed yet volumes of emotion are communicated through those scenes. Another - later - example is where Jack and his father are in the park when it's snowing. The weather seems to exaggerate the raw, emotional pain Jack is going through but no words are needed because the viewer knows exactly what he is feeling. The scene where the grief hits Jack is very poignant - he has been almost in a trance until then, trying to carry on as normal and yet what finally gets him in touch with his grief for Sarah is the almost ordinary combination of her lipstick on the wine glass and her voice on the answerphone. He tried to be so prepared, so involved in his wife's pregnancy but never came close to being prepared for the real outcome. I hate to say it, but there are points during Jack's early mourning period where the character comes across as what I believe non-English people think of the stereotypical Englishman - blocking out any emotion. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of the story starting when it does - we don't get any idea of what he was like before his wife Sarah was pregnant. The baby next to the sleeping Jack is an interesting metaphor. At that point, both are helpless in their own way, both only in tune with their own feelings, but baby Sarah at least has the excuse of not knowing any better. Jack's selfishness is entirely self-induced. There are some interesting attempts to explode stereotypes, which I think should be applauded. The characterisation of Jack's boss Anna is interesting - the assumption that just because she is female, she will be more sympathetic would be natural but she comes across as so work-driven that she almost becomes heartless. I think Jack is a bit overwhelmed by Anna, perhaps too much so - there are moments when she is quite cutting and when Jack would be right to correct her. There is a curious comparison with Amy, who - although superficially like other females in that she cooes over Sarah - is sufficiently vague at first that she doesn't even notice which sex baby Sarah is. Jack also tackles another himself over the issue of whether he can use the nursing mothers' room to change Sarah's nappy. In keeping with the theme of stereotypes, it is interesting how the opinions of the other characters try to influence the main ones. Jack's mum thinks Anna is outwardly great for him when she is really a selfish character, while Amy - who is a far kinder person - is written off as a "dreadful American girl". The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them. On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

    One of the strengths of this film is its subtlety. The first ten or fifteen minutes are a great example. Few words are needed yet volumes of emotion are communicated through those scenes. Another - later - example is where Jack and his father are in the park when it's snowing. The weather seems to exaggerate the raw, emotional pain Jack is going through but no words are needed because the viewer knows exactly what he is feeling. The scene where the grief hits Jack is very poignant - he has been almost in a trance until then, trying to carry on as normal and yet what finally gets him in touch with his grief for Sarah is the almost ordinary combination of her lipstick on the wine glass and her voice on the answerphone. He tried to be so prepared, so involved in his wife's pregnancy but never came close to being prepared for the real outcome. I hate to say it, but there are points during Jack's early mourning period where the character comes across as what I believe non-English people think of the stereotypical Englishman - blocking out any emotion. Perhaps this is a disadvantage of the story starting when it does - we don't get any idea of what he was like before his wife Sarah was pregnant. The baby next to the sleeping Jack is an interesting metaphor. At that point, both are helpless in their own way, both only in tune with their own feelings, but baby Sarah at least has the excuse of not knowing any better. Jack's selfishness is entirely self-induced. There are some interesting attempts to explode stereotypes, which I think should be applauded. The characterisation of Jack's boss Anna is interesting - the assumption that just because she is female, she will be more sympathetic would be natural but she comes across as so work-driven that she almost becomes heartless. I think Jack is a bit overwhelmed by Anna, perhaps too much so - there are moments when she is quite cutting and when Jack would be right to correct her. There is a curious comparison with Amy, who - although superficially like other females in that she cooes over Sarah - is sufficiently vague at first that she doesn't even notice which sex baby Sarah is. Jack also tackles another himself over the issue of whether he can use the nursing mothers' room to change Sarah's nappy. In keeping with the theme of stereotypes, it is interesting how the opinions of the other characters try to influence the main ones. Jack's mum thinks Anna is outwardly great for him when she is really a selfish character, while Amy - who is a far kinder person - is written off as a "dreadful American girl". The baby alarm worked rather well as a plot device - it's an overlooked but very useful piece of equipment. There are quite a lot of twists and turns in this plot - I think most are an intricate combination of clever writing and artful camera angles - but a lot of the plot development hinges on the budding relationship between Jack and Amy and when and how he treats her as a nanny or as a friend. It is obviously a grey area for them. On the surface, this film looks to be just your typical British romantic comedy but this one has some features that make it satisfyingly substantial. In terms of basic romantic plot it is broadly like Four Weddings and a Funeral, but unlike that film it is deeper and the characters are better written and investigated.

    A curious film. Patently chasing the golden goose formula of Four Weddings and a Funeral this comic film is replete with genuine tragedy, an American girl and a fairly top-drawer British cast. Indeed the film succeeds effortlessly when the actors have a reasonable chunk of script or scene to work with (with the exception of the mediocre Samantha Mathis). I also really enjoyed the fluid comedy, moving between the obvious and the surprising, equally well delivered by the ensemble. The film falls down though in its rather piecemeal approach. There's a feeling, almost literally, of the film being put together as if by marketeering scientists, looking to maximise its impact. There any number of bizarrely framed shots and loose ends - the set piece is king at the expense of overall cohesion. 4/10 but, hang on, I was conspicuously aware of it not being written or directed by Richard Curtis, so 5/10 for avoiding clone status.

    The casting being one of them. Richard E Grant, playing Jack is the first twist, a crazy workaholic type who likes to control everything and is completely narcissistic, witness him going through labour pains at the prenatal course. Jack is extremely unlikable, so much so that his pregnant wife, in an aside, whispers to her unborn baby that single parenthood might be ahead. Shift to the childbirth and the unfortunate death of the mother. Jack dissolves into morose alcoholism and narcissistic isolation. How Jack slowly evolves into something resembling a caring human being is the crux of the story. The supporting cast is amazing - Ian Maclellan, Judi Dench, Eileen Atkins - and they add points to a movie I would have rated below a 5 without them. Samantha Mathis tries but doesn't quite engage. We never know enough about her to care, apart from her infatuation with a guy who's bonking her best friend. I understand that Stephen Rea turned down the part of Jack and I would have preferred his tired jadedness in the role. Jack has a horror-movie type mania that jolts too much at times, I would seriously be reluctant to let him alone with a baby anything. Material has been done many times, but a nice twist at the end too. The main romance was so predictable, but so are they all in movies of this type. We go to them for no surprises, just the warm, slightly cloying fuzzies at the end. 6 out of 10.
