  6.7
 </rating>
 <sinopse>
  To avoid a potentially explosive scandal when the U.S. President goes into a coma, an affable temp agency owner with an uncanny resemblance, is put in his place.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Bill Mitchell is the philandering and distant President of the United States. Dave Kovic is a sweet-natured and caring Temp Agency operator, who by a staggering coincidence looks exactly like the President. As such, when Mitchell wants to escape an official luncheon, the Secret Service hires Dave to stand in for him. Unfortunately, Mitchell suffers a severe stroke whilst having sex with one of his aides, and Dave finds himself stuck in the role indefinitely. The corrupt and manipulative Chief of Staff, Bob Alexander, plans to use Dave to elevate himself to the White House - but unfortunately, he doesn't count on Dave enjoying himself in office, using his luck to make the country a better place, and falling in love with the beautiful First Lady...

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible.

"Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

I link arms with my fellow members. I'm the last to speak, so I stand up, clear my throat.... And after a moment's hesitation, say the following* "Now I can be a nasty little cynic at the best of times, but when this lovable piece of fluff called Dave crops up on TV (even at 3 in the morning, natch) I have to tune in. Why? Because it is the filmic equivalent of eating a Crunchie on a Friday, that warm blast of hot air when you enter a shop on a cold day, listening to your Rice Krispies snap, crackle and pop... You get the picture. There's something about it that gives you hope... That even when humanity reaches it's lowest ebb and is run by scum-sucking parasites... that one selfless man can come around and change everything. It espouses simple pleasures, radiates genuine warmth and when it's over, you feel the world isn't quite such a bad place anymore. I know I'm rambling, but I don't care.

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

"Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible.

Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

    Dave (1993) A hilarious wishful movie about what we really want our president to be. Kevin Kline is perfect in the role--both roles--a little goofy but totally believable. The rest of the cast doesn't much matter. They are decent if never amazing. It's a lightweight movie and to demand much beyond the gags and feel good qualities isn't fair to it. Does it hold up twenty years after it was made? Oddly, yes. You might not even notice it's a bit outdated on the fringes. Politics in some ways has not changed a bit. And the idea of body doubles for the U.S. President is still in currency (see "Vantage Point" for starters). Of course the notion of a secretive government that might pull of a huge scam isn't far-fetched at all (except of course that you hope it actually is far-fetched outside of Hollywood--see "Wag the Dog" for starters). There is also the use of lots of real people to bolster the idea that it's real, or could be real. Some are identified (senators and other celebrities from the era) so if you don't recognize them you should at least trust that these people are not actors. But there are a number (like 20 or 30) of other "real" people playing themselves, including Oliver Stone. In case you don't know him, Stone is being interviewed on Larry King Live (with the real Larry King) and he says that they've studied photos of the "new" president and that it's a conspiracy. This is really one of the many little hilarious lines because Stone, of course, is famous for hatching or nurturing conspiracy theories for his movies. His "JFK" came out just two years earlier. The other fun one most people will miss (and this dates me) is running into an unidentified Tip O'Neill on the streets. He was the real speaker of the house, and it's a great little three seconds. He dies the following year. Okay, the movie isn't brilliant. But it never gets stale, and it's well made enough to survive even a curmudgeon without popcorn. It'll make you laugh.

    *There is a circle of ten people sitting in chairs in a draughty village hall, but one is empty. I stroll in, making sure I haven't been followed and take a seat. I link arms with my fellow members. I'm the last to speak, so I stand up, clear my throat.... And after a moment's hesitation, say the following* "Now I can be a nasty little cynic at the best of times, but when this lovable piece of fluff called Dave crops up on TV (even at 3 in the morning, natch) I have to tune in. Why? Because it is the filmic equivalent of eating a Crunchie on a Friday, that warm blast of hot air when you enter a shop on a cold day, listening to your Rice Krispies snap, crackle and pop... You get the picture. There's something about it that gives you hope... That even when humanity reaches it's lowest ebb and is run by scum-sucking parasites... that one selfless man can come around and change everything. It espouses simple pleasures, radiates genuine warmth and when it's over, you feel the world isn't quite such a bad place anymore. I know I'm rambling, but I don't care. My name is Mr Wright and this movie is my answer to phoning the Samaritans, taking an overdose or running under a steam roller " *Sits down, rest of support group give rousing round of applause and pats on the back, a chap hands out leaflets saying when the next meeting is...* 9/10

    Ivan Reitman's "Dave" is a movie so idealist and well-meaning that it'll warm the hearts of even the most cynical Americans. Kevin Kline plays Dave Kovic, a small-town guy with a big heart who runs an employment agency. Dave's also a dead ringer for President Bill Mitchell and finds himself conscripted to stand in for Mitchell after the commander-in-chief suffers a stroke during an extramarital rendezvous. The naive idealist finds himself in an administration entrenched in cronyism and an embittered First Lady (Sigourney Weaver). And it doesn't take long for Washington to notice the changes in the no-longer-a-douche Bill Mitchell, as Dave sets out to use his power to make the country a better place ... while falling in love with Mrs. Mitchell. "Dave" makes no bones about its politics (which are worn on its sleeve), but ideology in this case is irrelevant. I's a story that puts the non-politician in the shoes of the most powerful position (may as well be a sly nod to Frank Capra's "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington"). Such an endeavor (especially with the extreme rhetoric of current politics) is nothing short of refreshing. Which is no doubt helped by the light-hearted romantic comedy nature of the film. Kline is at his most endearing in this role, Weaver her most charming and the supporting cast (Kevin Dunn, Frank Langella, Ving Rhames and Charles Grodin) is incredible. It's light and fluffy, but utterly likable in every way. 7/10

    I'm actually sort of surprised that no one has noted that the marvelous "Dave" is a remake of "The Prisoner of Zenda," about a commoner who impersonates his look-alike prince-crowned-king while falling in love with his princess to be. The only change in story is that while "Zenda's" hero lives happily ever after, alas, it's not with his princess. Under Ivan Reitman's sure-handed blend of subtle comedy & drama, and backed by James Newton Howard's melodic score, Kevin Kline is aces as average guy/everyman Dave, who is plucked from Small Town, USA, to assume the position of the most powerful man on earth. Equally up to the task is Frank Langella as his evil, rotten, power- hungry Chief of Staff. The co-stars, including Sigourney Weaver, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Charles Grodin & Ben Kingsley,are each finely cast. Three sound versions of "Zenda" were filmed: in 1937 with Ronald Coleman in the dual role & Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as his adversary; in 1952 with good guy Stewart Granger vs. baddie James Mason; and finally in 1979 - the least impressive version - with Peter Sellers, in his third to last role, fighting evil Stuart Wilson. "Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    An excellent cast, headed up by Kevin Kline in the dual roles of President and lookalike, does a good job in this political satire-cum-romantic comedy. The plot is relatively straightforward - lookalike Dave, trapped into continuing his Presidential impersonation because of the President's secret stroke, then starting to feel his feet in the role to the annoyance of Machiavellian Presidential aide Frank Langella - but everyone performs with commitment and integrity. Kline is first rate, the burgeoning feelings between him and Sigourney Weaver's First Lady is believable, and Langella and Kevin Dunn as the two aides who are in on it are both, in very different ways, very good. This is an enjoyable film.

    The Prisoner of Zenda. Moon over Parador. The Man in the Iron Mask. A look-alike impersonates a national leader. This idea has been used before. Heck, Robert Heinlein won the Hugo award almost 60 years ago with this old gag in his book Double Star. But Kevin Kline gives it wide-eyed freshness as a likable nobody who finds himself playing the U.S. president and romancing the first lady. And the audience gets an insider's view of Washington's corridors of power and the schemers who make their living there. It's a far-fetched piece of whimsy, but the treatment is clever, adult, romantic and sharply satirical and the result is a winning confection of a film with beautiful comedic timing.

    Every element in this movie is filled with elegance. Look for instance to the music; it's like the soundtrack of a documentary about the goodness in the world ! The cinematography is smooth. The characters are polished. And everything is damn tame. I worried about sliding over the furbished *icy* surface ! The writing is usual at best. I wanted any crazy scene, to have none. Save (Kevin Kline) moment of "God bless you, God bless AMERICAAA!" and (Oliver Stone) cameo, I didn't recognize anything comic around. The lost opportunities for making laughs are many (meeting the president and the first lady in the street to just singing Tomorrow is so obvious one). Simply as a funny movie it's soulless. Then, more writing problems; for one, cutting down the budget seemed too easy. And if it was intended to satirize some of the White House unwise policies, then why the script didn't extend the line, to see some fixes where the good-heartedness and patriotism would lead rightly?! To add more ice, (Frank Langella) did his worst acting ever, or non-acting to be specific. OH MY GOD, as if he was determined on giving no reaction at all to the camera. He hated his role? The movie? The producer? Himself ??! I don't know but one thing; if he was replaced with a stone, it would have been nicer ! The rest of the cast did their jobs inside very limited areas caused by uncreative script and direction. For instance (Ben Kingsley) wasn't allowed to do anything good; comic or serious. And for more painful instance let me say that (Kline) acted the character of the unreal president as funny as the character of the real one ! In brief I waited to laugh, instead I watched a conventional movie about how the ordinary citizen can rule a country ideally by only his own simplicity and innocence. That, according to the movie's story and actors, was disappointing. I felt it as a school film, or a presidential speech, about doing the right thing mistaken for a comedy ! Among other remakes of (The Magnificent Fraud  1939), (Dave) is the coldest. Despite its elegance it fails in amusing. The thing is this movie was too rational to a boring degree.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.

    Dave is directed by Ivan Reitman and written by Gary Ross. It stars Kevin Kline, Sigourney Weaver, Frank Langella, Kevin Dunn, Ving Rhames, Ben Kingsley, Tom Dugan, Charles Grodin and Laura Linney. Music is by James Newton Howard and cinematography by Adam Greenberg. Dave Kovic (Kline) is an ordinary Joe type of guy who just happens to look like the current president of the U.S.A (also played by Kline). In fact he makes a little extra cash on the side of his Temp Agency business by impersonating the president at openings and such. When president Mitchell suffers a stroke, the White House Chief of Staff Bob Alexander (Langella) instills Dave as the president so as to feather his own ambitions to become President... It's actually a joy in this day and age to go back and visit a comedy like Dave, for it proves to be refreshingly simple. It's a case of being honest comedy that is well written, a story that in spite of the undoubted preposterousness of plotting, carries you along by the sheer willingness to put a smile on your face. True, clich&eacute;s are rife, but it isn't fishing in the toilet bowl for its laughs, or beating you over the head with raucous shouty antics so beloved by the MTV generation. A great cast is assembled for the fun, led superbly by the talented Kline in a role that so easily could have been over done in a lesser comic actor's hands. Helps as well that Kline can do good drama, so when the film inevitably turns into serious mode, and politico posturing gets a caustic once over, the transition is handled expertly. Weaver is pure charm, finding great chemistry with Kline, Langella wonderfully stomps around in chief villain mode, Dunn and Rhames score high and Grodin as usual owns the brief scenes he is in. While an Oliver Stone cameo scene is sheer brilliance. There is no pushing the boundaries of comedy here, and it wasn't trying to outsmart the 1990s cinema goer, it's simplicity supreme and as honest as the day is long. Which quite frankly is sometimes all you need in this big hurry up world of today. 8/10

"Dave" matches up a lot closer with those earlier two versions than with the Seller's take. The shot of Dave heading back home over the hill, his job done, is a marvelous re-do of the Coleman version. BTW, In 1968, Don Adams wrote a take-off on "Zenda" as well as its 2- part sequel in '69, but that's another story, so to speak.

    SPOILER ALERT!!! In the movie, Dave wins the first lady's heart by saving $650 million dollars for a program to help the homeless, which the bad guys wanted to slash from the budget. Pause for a moment and consider that, according to the Government Accountability Office (GAO), the federal government spent $2.9 billion for federal homeless programs in 2009. It makes you realize that maybe the real problem isn't that the federal government doesn't spend enough to solve homelessness, maybe instead it's that federal homeless programs aren't really all that well administered or maybe just not really all that effective. What if it's not the "bad guys" who are the problem? What if at least some of the guys in charge are every bit as well-intentioned as "Dave" but the problem is that their good intentions are ineffective, or maybe even counterproductive? "Dave" is a lighthearted comedy with some funny bits, but it also is an unabashed propaganda film which advocates vast expansion of the federal government as a panacea for all social and economic ills. I'd love to see a Libertarian version of this film where "Dave" gets into office and slashes the federal budget to the bone, fires all the "czars", ends the "War on Drugs", eliminates the Department of Education and the Department of Homeland Security, abolishes affirmative action, ends agricultural subsidies, privatizes social security, vastly simplifies the tax code, and returns the nation to its constitutional foundation.

    Is the president little more than a glorified actor?

    I saw this movie because it was recommended to me for its political satire. I never really saw Ivan Reitman as being a satirical director - the films he usually does are simply happy ending films with a few laughs in them: movies like Twins and Kindergarten Cop. He is also known for doing kids movies such as Beethoven. I was wrong. Dave is satirical, though not a deep and as complex as some movies can be. Anyway, Dave finds people jobs, but in his spare time his mimics the President of the United States because he has an uncanny resemblance to him (probably because Dave and the president are played by the same actor - Kevin Kline). The secret service find Dave when they are looking for a look alike to walk out of a hotel and into a limousine, simply to protect the president. Dave agrees, but unfortunately the president suffers from a stroke while sleeping with his secretary. Suddenly Dave finds himself ruling the United States from the oval office. He is doing this because the Chief of Staff wants to become president himself, and is attempting to remove the vice-president from office and move himself in under Dave. Unfortunately Dave proves to be too much to handle, and quickly turns the tables on the Chief of Staff and a battle of wits ensures. The main theme is appearance and reality. What we have is the president - a conservative law student who is adulterous, hates his wife, and simply cares only for himself. Then we have Dave - an out going man who comes to see the power of the office as being a responsibility to the people. The chief of staff is manipulating him, but when Dave learns of what this guy is doing, he begins to take the power that is supposed to be is - all the time being reminded that he is a simply clutz from the street who happens to look like the president. He has one thing that he holds the chief of staff to though - he is pretending to be the president under the directions of the chief of staff - if he goes down then so does the chief of staff. I guess what this movie is saying is that politicians are generally people who are caught up in a world revolving around the powerhouses in Washington and only go out to the people during elections to gain votes. At other times they simply don't care. It is an interesting criticism on the budget when Dave brings in his accountant friend to go over the US budget and easily slashes 650 billion dollars from places where money is being wasted. It would be interesting to get a proper accountant to look at the figures of the budget and see if this is the case, though we only know what the government is telling us. Dave was good, and it involved the clever battle of wits that I enjoy in some movies. There was little to really complain about and I did think that Dave was quite a noble gentleman.
