 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  In the Alpine village of Tolzbad in the 1800s, the townsfolk talk quietly and restrain their movements lest they incur avalanches. This atmosphere lends itself to repressed emotions - shown through the parallel stories of butler student Johann lusting after his mother (an old flame of the mysterious Count Knotkers) and Klara's attraction to her father (who lusts after his other daughter), leading to duels and suicidal plunges galore. All this is shot in the style of an early German sonal film, complete with intertitles, crackly sound-track and 'hand-tinted' colour effects.

    I love Guy Maddin's work and this is my favourite of his films. It's odd and unsettling and it sticks with you long after you've watched it. It's definitely not the most accessible of his works, but I like it. It's been described as a "pro-repressionist" movie, but I don't think that's entirely accurate. The people portrayed in the village are deeply repressed and one small push makes their whole stack of cards morals come tumbling down. It's tale of three brothers and their trials and tribulations. Their father is deceased and one brother, Vince Rimmer as Franz, is an invalid confined to the attic, who can do little more than watch as his brothers are tempted and run amok. First Brent Neale as Johann, then Kyle McColloch as Grigorss give in to their desires and forbidden longings with tragic consequences. Kyle McColloch is a Maddin regular and he shines here. Engagements are broken, people have knife fights and their mother is seeking to re-marry.

    I really like Maddin. I like the way he thinks visually first. Narrative is not only woven into and communicated by cinematic means, but his characters live in a similar world. They experience the world, the same way we experience the film: by what some call a surrealistic dream world. It is not. Rather it is a world wholly driven by laws, laws we understand because they are rooted in film worlds we have visited. I have two of his films on my "must experience before you die" list. This one is narratively less subtle and powerful than those. He makes a trade-off by investing in what is often - including here - called "German Expressionism." Actually, the model is German mountain films, a quite different beast: one that is more genuinely pre-noir. The world behind those films has a people in tune with a nature that limits their lives, often controlling. American noir would later merge this collection of laws with the narrative conventions built into the act of viewing. What this film does is insert itself before that development. It is pre-noir tragedy with noir-like conventions, cast using those German pre- noir images. It is a stretch to merge German notions of superior harmony with the mountain homeland with the Nazi comfort with the cruelty of nature. But heck, others do; there is the tradition of Riefenstahl's mountain films and then her similarly inspired Nazi propaganda; and after all, films like this encourage such stretches. And a similar stretch goes in the "White Ribbon" direction, with nature and its German bond with sexual repression behind what happened. Herzog continues this even today.But all that is predicable and easy to read, compared to Maddin's deeper stuff. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    This movie was a real mixed bag to me. On the one hand you have an original movie, that taking an unique vintage approach but on the other hand it's something that just doesn't always work out too well. First of all, I can really appreciated Guy Maddin and his style of unique film-making, that is often a throwback to the classic early movie's era. With this movie Guy Maddin went back to the early days of German expressionism, which in the past had provided us with many great classic and very memorable and beautiful looking movies, mostly during the early 1920's. The movie begins very well and promising enough but overall, is this movie really being German expressionistic? It tries alright but in my opinion it really isn't. It's really lacking the right looks and techniques. Despite some hard efforts, the movie is really too modern looking. Why not use consistently an one color filtering throughout the entire movie? A look that was very distinctive and recognizable for an 1920's movie but gets only sporadically used in this actual movie. They applied some filters during and after filming but what it mostly does is making the colors look a bit dim. It doesn't really give the movie an old vintage feeling. Besides, if this was supposed to be like a German expressionistic movie, then where are all the great looking sets and backgrounds that made expressionistic movies what they were. Instead this movie is looking like a modern but also cheap movie, that does absolutely nothing with its environments or sets. One thing that also doesn't seem very consistent with its style and approach is the fact that this is a talkie. The movie would had probably worked out better if it was more being like a silent movie, using title cards and perhaps a narrator, like Maddin for instance did previously with "Tales from the Gimli Hospital", a movie that did a far better job with its silent movie elements and more modern film-making elements and approach. The story would had probably worked out far better as well that way. Silent movies can simply get away with a lot more. Now instead the movie works out needlessly confusing and weird. Yes, it obviously is already a bit of a weird movie in the first place but all of its dialog and story lines make the movie even more odd to watch. It's just not very compelling and the characters are far too (intentionaly) flat to care about. The story besides gets told in a bit of a messy way and doesn't tell one main story but instead about two different ones. It really doesn't make the movie a very consistent one. So all in all, I can appreciate Guy Maddin's approach and the weirdness he brings to this movie but it ultimately doesn't always works out too well for this particular movie, which makes it a bit of a mixed bad to watch. Nice try but no cigar. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Influenced by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s and filtered through the oddball sensibilities of writer/director Guy Maddin, Careful is a film like no other. Maddin appropriates silent cinema's monochrome aesthetic in multiple scenes but even when color is being used in a more traditional way he tends to fill the screen with garish brightness. The film has (melo)dramatic elements but is primarily comedic, albeit with a wink and a nudge subtlety almost altogether absent from silent film's heyday. The bizarre plot of the film is centered on a repressed mountain community, particularly the brothers Johan and Grigors and their mother. The boys' father, who lost both his eyes in separate freak accidents, is long since dead and their older brother is locked in the attic where he silently watches. Johan and his younger brother spend most of their time in a strict school for butlers where they learn about dining etiquette and grooming. Johan becomes engaged to Klara, a local girl who lusts after her own father in spite of his clear favoritism toward his younger daughter, in spite of his own obsessive lust directed at his mother. Naturally, characters become involved in murder plots, duels, and suicide as they're too repressed and shut off to resolve their problems in a less dramatic fashion. Thematically, Careful is too jumbled to have much coherence but like most Maddin films this is more about style than plot or meaning. Maddin's creative visual style is engaging enough on its own to make Careful a worthwhile film.

    "Careful" is to Guy Maddin what "Eraserhead" was to David Lynch. Its his most pure and psychologically fascinating film, and while it isn't accessible to most, its also possibly his finest achievement. Guy Maddin creates surrealist films made in the style of classic films. This in particular resembles a Technicolor (and occasionally tinted) version of a German expressionist film with sound. Still, the highly sexual subject matter sets it far apart from any film of that era. Also, Maddin has a very droll sense of humor that borders on camp but never feels gimmicky. His dialog which mocks clich&eacute;s will have the viewer in stitches if they appreciate the bizarre. "Careful" is the ultimate film of one of today's most visionary and unique filmmakers. "Careful" is a surreal masterpiece for several reasons. The film maintains a consistent hallucinogenic appearance. It resembles early cinema as noted above, but absolutely nothing else made nowadays. Maddin obsessively recreates the look and feel of those films at times and admirably so. He also seems to be able to recapture the distorted and confused mindset of the Expressionist era, except with a post-modern sense. I mean, there's no silent film I can think of where one of the protagonists takes cuts off his fingers in a gory fashion on camera. "Careful" is Maddin's best work and an absolute must for those with a taste for the bizarre and original. (9/10)

    This is my first experience with a Guy Maddin movie and I have to say that it took a while to get myself accustomed to his particular style. At first I thought all the movie would be a mind boggling homage to early German cinema combined with some ideas from the seventies comedies and exploitation movies. But the movie actually goes into a surprisingly coherent story involving not only the superficial aspects of style but deep ideas relating Careful via Expressionism to the early days of psychoanalysis. Dealing with issues such as an incestuous relation between mother and son, love-hate relationships between parents and children, brothers and sisters etc. this film comes pretty close to a Twin Peaks directed by von Stroheim as it has been earlier characterized. But this is more than a quirky story with stylish camera-work, it is more like a nightmare that puts our innermost nature at stake. Just like any compelling nightmare it is packed with a bizarre sense of humor and a hand-full of absurd scenes but they only help boost the mood and do not interfere with the essentially humane story. I look forward to seeing other Maddin movies and I hope they will be at least the experience this one proved to be

    Bizarre and highly imaginative film with a distinctive style. It reminds me a little bit of "Quintet" (the snowy background, and parts of the soundtrack) and "Institute Benjamenta" (the low-key weirdness and the butler-school sub-theme). The humour is subtle; there are no laugh-out-loud moments, but some of the ideas are hilarious. For example, Sarah Neville deciding to work in a mine(!), in which we later find more women. Or the almost pythonesque conversation between Neville and McCulloch, in which they both yawn(!) while the former tells the latter about having been molested by her father. But Madden probably didn't intend to go for the big laughs otherwise he wouldn't have made this whole thing so moody.

    Guy Madden is almost like the David Lynch of Canada. His films have a look all of their own; blending surrealism with German style expressionism. The grainy slightly faded style of his films, make them appear from another era. "Careful" is filmed in a bright Technicolor style that's visually dazzling. The film contains Icelandic folk lore with dark humor. The story concerns a town living in the mountains. They have to watch their every move so they don't cause an avalanche. So they try to keep quiet and not make much noise out of fear. Many of the characters have strange incestuous desires that lead them to insanity. Especially Yohan and his fantasies about his mother. Yuck! This is one strange film, with picturesque landscapes that look like they jumped out of a Salvador Dali painting. If you are looking for a disturbing candy colored dark comedy, careful you don't pass this opportunity up.

    I recently watched the film, Careful, by Guy Maddin on television and found it to be very interesting indeed. The person introducing the film called Maddin a Canadian David Lynch and while both directors do have a certain flair for the unusual, I believe Lynch to be a surrealist while Maddin's style to be something else entirely. Granted, Careful is the only film of Maddin's I have seen except for excerpts and press for The Saddest Music in the World, but his style, at least in this film, is one of sentimentality and homage. I have seen plenty of German Expressionist films and Careful would seem to fit right into that mold. I myself have often toyed with the idea of producing a film in the Expressionist style if only for the exercise of it. Maddin has produced an Expressionist film in the year 1992 which flawlessly mimics the films of Ufa, Wiene, Murnau, and Lang from the early 20th century. Any viewer, even those versed in early Expressionism, who would happen across this film without any context would be forgiven for mistaking it to be an actual 80-year-old film, so true is Maddin's style, so exacting is his pacing. Full frame color tinting, sound stage shooting, post-produced soundtrack, rigid acting style, and obsolete directorial choices, combine to provide the viewer with a disturbing portrait of repression, duty, and mountain goats. This film is incredible!

    This is the second Guy Maddin film that I've seen (the other being "Twilight of the Ice Nymphs") and in both cases, the films wore out their welcome about half an hour in. I enjoy the offbeat style of the humor, the intentional visual stylization patterned after early silent films (this one reminded me particularly of the work of Melies), and I have no problem with the flat acting style (which is an honest homage to early film acting) or the coloring (which, again, is based in films of yesteryear). Where Maddin's films run into trouble is, as soon as the novelty has worn off and the character based introductory jokes have played out, there is simply nothing beneath it all for the film to fall back on. The story is actually very simple, yet it is so relentlessly bizarre that it borders on surrealism. So, either there is no deeper meaning to the story, or it's so far buried that it eludes me during the actual viewing of the piece. (Not that one can't come up with various things after the fact; I simply doubt that the director intended them or had any control over them if I can only interpret the vaguest elements of the story.) The concept of Oedipal lust and such simply aren't enough to sustain a film of this length. Not in the way that they are handled anyway. The film is absolutely brilliant up until Johann dies. It then withers quickly, as the last real belly laugh comes in the first few minutes of "Part Two." The remaining hour or so limps along to a decent though unsatisfying end. Guy Maddin is without doubt a clever and unique director, and I look forward to the day when I can say that I've seen him at his best. But he's far from it in this film in my opinion. Endless homages to early films aren't enough to last 100 minutes... And perversity caused by child rearing needs to be handled more cleverly to take up the slack...

    Guy Madden is almost like the David Lynch of Canada. His films have a look all of their own; blending surrealism with German style expressionism. The grainy slightly faded style of his films, make them appear from another era. "Careful" is filmed in a bright Technicolor style that's visually dazzling. The film contains Icelandic folk lore with dark humor. The story concerns a town living in the mountains. They have to watch their every move so they don't cause an avalanche. So they try to keep quiet and not make much noise out of fear. Many of the characters have strange incestuous desires that lead them to insanity. Especially Yohan and his fantasies about his mother. Yuck! This is one strange film, with picturesque landscapes that look like they jumped out of a Salvador Dali painting. If you are looking for a disturbing candy colored dark comedy, careful you don't pass this opportunity up.

    I recently watched the film, Careful, by Guy Maddin on television and found it to be very interesting indeed. The person introducing the film called Maddin a Canadian David Lynch and while both directors do have a certain flair for the unusual, I believe Lynch to be a surrealist while Maddin's style to be something else entirely. Granted, Careful is the only film of Maddin's I have seen except for excerpts and press for The Saddest Music in the World, but his style, at least in this film, is one of sentimentality and homage. I have seen plenty of German Expressionist films and Careful would seem to fit right into that mold. I myself have often toyed with the idea of producing a film in the Expressionist style if only for the exercise of it. Maddin has produced an Expressionist film in the year 1992 which flawlessly mimics the films of Ufa, Wiene, Murnau, and Lang from the early 20th century. Any viewer, even those versed in early Expressionism, who would happen across this film without any context would be forgiven for mistaking it to be an actual 80-year-old film, so true is Maddin's style, so exacting is his pacing. Full frame color tinting, sound stage shooting, post-produced soundtrack, rigid acting style, and obsolete directorial choices, combine to provide the viewer with a disturbing portrait of repression, duty, and mountain goats. This film is incredible!

    This is the second Guy Maddin film that I've seen (the other being "Twilight of the Ice Nymphs") and in both cases, the films wore out their welcome about half an hour in. I enjoy the offbeat style of the humor, the intentional visual stylization patterned after early silent films (this one reminded me particularly of the work of Melies), and I have no problem with the flat acting style (which is an honest homage to early film acting) or the coloring (which, again, is based in films of yesteryear). Where Maddin's films run into trouble is, as soon as the novelty has worn off and the character based introductory jokes have played out, there is simply nothing beneath it all for the film to fall back on. The story is actually very simple, yet it is so relentlessly bizarre that it borders on surrealism. So, either there is no deeper meaning to the story, or it's so far buried that it eludes me during the actual viewing of the piece. (Not that one can't come up with various things after the fact; I simply doubt that the director intended them or had any control over them if I can only interpret the vaguest elements of the story.) The concept of Oedipal lust and such simply aren't enough to sustain a film of this length. Not in the way that they are handled anyway. The film is absolutely brilliant up until Johann dies. It then withers quickly, as the last real belly laugh comes in the first few minutes of "Part Two." The remaining hour or so limps along to a decent though unsatisfying end. Guy Maddin is without doubt a clever and unique director, and I look forward to the day when I can say that I've seen him at his best. But he's far from it in this film in my opinion. Endless homages to early films aren't enough to last 100 minutes... And perversity caused by child rearing needs to be handled more cleverly to take up the slack...

    I love Guy Maddin's work and this is my favourite of his films. It's odd and unsettling and it sticks with you long after you've watched it. It's definitely not the most accessible of his works, but I like it. It's been described as a "pro-repressionist" movie, but I don't think that's entirely accurate. The people portrayed in the village are deeply repressed and one small push makes their whole stack of cards morals come tumbling down. It's tale of three brothers and their trials and tribulations. Their father is deceased and one brother, Vince Rimmer as Franz, is an invalid confined to the attic, who can do little more than watch as his brothers are tempted and run amok. First Brent Neale as Johann, then Kyle McColloch as Grigorss give in to their desires and forbidden longings with tragic consequences. Kyle McColloch is a Maddin regular and he shines here. Engagements are broken, people have knife fights and their mother is seeking to re-marry.

    I really like Maddin. I like the way he thinks visually first. Narrative is not only woven into and communicated by cinematic means, but his characters live in a similar world. They experience the world, the same way we experience the film: by what some call a surrealistic dream world. It is not. Rather it is a world wholly driven by laws, laws we understand because they are rooted in film worlds we have visited. I have two of his films on my "must experience before you die" list. This one is narratively less subtle and powerful than those. He makes a trade-off by investing in what is often - including here - called "German Expressionism." Actually, the model is German mountain films, a quite different beast: one that is more genuinely pre-noir. The world behind those films has a people in tune with a nature that limits their lives, often controlling. American noir would later merge this collection of laws with the narrative conventions built into the act of viewing. What this film does is insert itself before that development. It is pre-noir tragedy with noir-like conventions, cast using those German pre- noir images. It is a stretch to merge German notions of superior harmony with the mountain homeland with the Nazi comfort with the cruelty of nature. But heck, others do; there is the tradition of Riefenstahl's mountain films and then her similarly inspired Nazi propaganda; and after all, films like this encourage such stretches. And a similar stretch goes in the "White Ribbon" direction, with nature and its German bond with sexual repression behind what happened. Herzog continues this even today.But all that is predicable and easy to read, compared to Maddin's deeper stuff. Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.

    This movie was a real mixed bag to me. On the one hand you have an original movie, that taking an unique vintage approach but on the other hand it's something that just doesn't always work out too well. First of all, I can really appreciated Guy Maddin and his style of unique film-making, that is often a throwback to the classic early movie's era. With this movie Guy Maddin went back to the early days of German expressionism, which in the past had provided us with many great classic and very memorable and beautiful looking movies, mostly during the early 1920's. The movie begins very well and promising enough but overall, is this movie really being German expressionistic? It tries alright but in my opinion it really isn't. It's really lacking the right looks and techniques. Despite some hard efforts, the movie is really too modern looking. Why not use consistently an one color filtering throughout the entire movie? A look that was very distinctive and recognizable for an 1920's movie but gets only sporadically used in this actual movie. They applied some filters during and after filming but what it mostly does is making the colors look a bit dim. It doesn't really give the movie an old vintage feeling. Besides, if this was supposed to be like a German expressionistic movie, then where are all the great looking sets and backgrounds that made expressionistic movies what they were. Instead this movie is looking like a modern but also cheap movie, that does absolutely nothing with its environments or sets. One thing that also doesn't seem very consistent with its style and approach is the fact that this is a talkie. The movie would had probably worked out better if it was more being like a silent movie, using title cards and perhaps a narrator, like Maddin for instance did previously with "Tales from the Gimli Hospital", a movie that did a far better job with its silent movie elements and more modern film-making elements and approach. The story would had probably worked out far better as well that way. Silent movies can simply get away with a lot more. Now instead the movie works out needlessly confusing and weird. Yes, it obviously is already a bit of a weird movie in the first place but all of its dialog and story lines make the movie even more odd to watch. It's just not very compelling and the characters are far too (intentionaly) flat to care about. The story besides gets told in a bit of a messy way and doesn't tell one main story but instead about two different ones. It really doesn't make the movie a very consistent one. So all in all, I can appreciate Guy Maddin's approach and the weirdness he brings to this movie but it ultimately doesn't always works out too well for this particular movie, which makes it a bit of a mixed bad to watch. Nice try but no cigar. 6/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/

    Influenced by the German Expressionist films of the 1920s and filtered through the oddball sensibilities of writer/director Guy Maddin, Careful is a film like no other. Maddin appropriates silent cinema's monochrome aesthetic in multiple scenes but even when color is being used in a more traditional way he tends to fill the screen with garish brightness. The film has (melo)dramatic elements but is primarily comedic, albeit with a wink and a nudge subtlety almost altogether absent from silent film's heyday. The bizarre plot of the film is centered on a repressed mountain community, particularly the brothers Johan and Grigors and their mother. The boys' father, who lost both his eyes in separate freak accidents, is long since dead and their older brother is locked in the attic where he silently watches. Johan and his younger brother spend most of their time in a strict school for butlers where they learn about dining etiquette and grooming. Johan becomes engaged to Klara, a local girl who lusts after her own father in spite of his clear favoritism toward his younger daughter, in spite of his own obsessive lust directed at his mother. Naturally, characters become involved in murder plots, duels, and suicide as they're too repressed and shut off to resolve their problems in a less dramatic fashion. Thematically, Careful is too jumbled to have much coherence but like most Maddin films this is more about style than plot or meaning. Maddin's creative visual style is engaging enough on its own to make Careful a worthwhile film.

    "Careful" is to Guy Maddin what "Eraserhead" was to David Lynch. Its his most pure and psychologically fascinating film, and while it isn't accessible to most, its also possibly his finest achievement. Guy Maddin creates surrealist films made in the style of classic films. This in particular resembles a Technicolor (and occasionally tinted) version of a German expressionist film with sound. Still, the highly sexual subject matter sets it far apart from any film of that era. Also, Maddin has a very droll sense of humor that borders on camp but never feels gimmicky. His dialog which mocks clich&eacute;s will have the viewer in stitches if they appreciate the bizarre. "Careful" is the ultimate film of one of today's most visionary and unique filmmakers. "Careful" is a surreal masterpiece for several reasons. The film maintains a consistent hallucinogenic appearance. It resembles early cinema as noted above, but absolutely nothing else made nowadays. Maddin obsessively recreates the look and feel of those films at times and admirably so. He also seems to be able to recapture the distorted and confused mindset of the Expressionist era, except with a post-modern sense. I mean, there's no silent film I can think of where one of the protagonists takes cuts off his fingers in a gory fashion on camera. "Careful" is Maddin's best work and an absolute must for those with a taste for the bizarre and original. (9/10)

    This is my first experience with a Guy Maddin movie and I have to say that it took a while to get myself accustomed to his particular style. At first I thought all the movie would be a mind boggling homage to early German cinema combined with some ideas from the seventies comedies and exploitation movies. But the movie actually goes into a surprisingly coherent story involving not only the superficial aspects of style but deep ideas relating Careful via Expressionism to the early days of psychoanalysis. Dealing with issues such as an incestuous relation between mother and son, love-hate relationships between parents and children, brothers and sisters etc. this film comes pretty close to a Twin Peaks directed by von Stroheim as it has been earlier characterized. But this is more than a quirky story with stylish camera-work, it is more like a nightmare that puts our innermost nature at stake. Just like any compelling nightmare it is packed with a bizarre sense of humor and a hand-full of absurd scenes but they only help boost the mood and do not interfere with the essentially humane story. I look forward to seeing other Maddin movies and I hope they will be at least the experience this one proved to be

    Bizarre and highly imaginative film with a distinctive style. It reminds me a little bit of "Quintet" (the snowy background, and parts of the soundtrack) and "Institute Benjamenta" (the low-key weirdness and the butler-school sub-theme). The humour is subtle; there are no laugh-out-loud moments, but some of the ideas are hilarious. For example, Sarah Neville deciding to work in a mine(!), in which we later find more women. Or the almost pythonesque conversation between Neville and McCulloch, in which they both yawn(!) while the former tells the latter about having been molested by her father. But Madden probably didn't intend to go for the big laughs otherwise he wouldn't have made this whole thing so moody.
