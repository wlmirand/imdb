 <sinopse>
  The story of a young man's adventures in the Californian pornography industry of the 1970s and 1980s.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  Eddie Adams would have been just another high-school drop-out had he not met the likes of adult film director Jack Horner. Horner transforms Eddie into Dirk Diggler, a rising-star actor with a special gift. Set in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the film is a tribute to the decor, style, culture, and social attitudes of the era.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

    Boogie Nights is a film that shows people's ups and people's downs. It shows this in a fresh, original, and great way. Boogie Nights starts off with showing us the inside of Maurice Rodriguez's night club. Rodriguez is a man who just wants to desperately star in an adult film. After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

    Boogie Nights is a film that shows people's ups and people's downs. It shows this in a fresh, original, and great way. Boogie Nights starts off with showing us the inside of Maurice Rodriguez's night club. Rodriguez is a man who just wants to desperately star in an adult film. After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

    Boogie Nights is a film that shows people's ups and people's downs. It shows this in a fresh, original, and great way. Boogie Nights starts off with showing us the inside of Maurice Rodriguez's night club. Rodriguez is a man who just wants to desperately star in an adult film. After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

    Boogie Nights is a film that shows people's ups and people's downs. It shows this in a fresh, original, and great way. Boogie Nights starts off with showing us the inside of Maurice Rodriguez's night club. Rodriguez is a man who just wants to desperately star in an adult film. After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS (dir. Paul Thomas Anderson) This is an unquestionable film classic that concerns a most unusual subject, 'The American Adult Film Industry'. Anderson has directed and written a film of great emotional depth, and the subject of porn is an area where most people would assume that emotions and human feelings are far less important than clothing at a photoshoot. The film boasts a cross section of America's finest character actors, and Anderson took an extremely big chance on a couple of actors who must have seemed like very questionable choices. By the mid 90's when BOOGIE NIGHTS was released, Burt Reynolds tabloid personal life exemplified the most lurid aspects of The Seventies, and his inclusion in the film might have detracted from Anderson's nuanced presentation of the film industry's impact upon sexual liberation. But, Reynolds delivers a perfect characterization of an American businessman who is only satisfying the public's nascent hunger for cinematic knowledge of the country's changing sexual mores. And, casting Mark Wahlberg in the lead role of Dirk Diggler was risky at best. At the time, Wahlberg was primarily known as a member of a boy band and an underwear model, but who really knew that he could be such a convincing actor? The film is very long, but never lags, and there are really far too many fine performances to note. MUST SEE

    This is a great film. It has a great story, a great cast, a great director, great dialog. Everything about this movie is great. In my opinion, this is Paul Thomas Anderson's best work. I'm a fan of his, although I have yet to see Hard Eight a.k.a. Sydney or The Master. There are three living directors today (or directing teams) who write their own screenplays that can really tell the best stories on film. Quentin Tarantino, Joel and Ethan Coen, and last, but most definitely not least, Paul Thomas Anderson. (I'd like to give Martin Scorsese honorable mention for Goodfellas and Mean Streets, though he doesn't write his own screenplays very often). Boogie Nights is one of my favorite films. I'd place it in my top 20, if not, top 15. And I've seen a lot of movies. So, watch Boogie Nights. Please. I doubt you'll be disappointed.

    Boogie Nights is a film that shows people's ups and people's downs. It shows this in a fresh, original, and great way. Boogie Nights starts off with showing us the inside of Maurice Rodriguez's night club. Rodriguez is a man who just wants to desperately star in an adult film. After we go through the entrance of the club, that's when we see Jack and Amber, (Burt Reynolds and Julianne Moore) stroll into the club and take a seat at a table. We get a glance around the night club and this is where we meet Reed and Buck,(John C. Reilly and Don Cheadle.) They're both dancing on the dance floor and having a good time. We then cut back to Jack and Amber and see the next important character, Rollerblade girl, (Heather Graham) talking to them both. After this scene, Jack eyes zoom in on Eddie Adams a.k.a Dirk Diggler, (Mark Wahlberg.) Dirk Diggler is a young 17 year old boy with big dreams of becoming an adult film star. Jack gets up and goes to talk to Diggler, and this is where Diggler's life changes, for the better, and for worse. Anderson does a great job showing all of the adult film stars up rise in the 70's and their downfall in the 80's. The screenplay that has been written for this film is amazing. The dialogue feels real and is sharp, the story line is interesting, original, and it keeps me entertained throughout. The characters are strong and dimensional as well. Again, Anderson also does a great job with the direction. I don't need to explain myself here, you'll see what I am talking about if you watch it. The acting in this film is very strong. Reynolds and Moore definitely deserved the nomination's they got for their performances in this film. Wahlberg also takes advantage of his role in this film and turns in a solid performance. The rest of the supporting cast's performances in this film are also solid all around. Overall, Boogie Nights is an amazing film. I believe that it didn't get enough attention and recognition from the academy, it should've at least had a nomination for Best Picture to go along with it's other 3 nominations. Boogie Nights was definitely one of my favourite movies and it probably always will be. If you haven't seen it yet then I suggest that you go and buy it pronto, you won't regret it. I promise. 8.5/10

    BOOGIE NIGHTS This was a funny movie. The story is about the rise and fall of Dirk Diggler. A guy who washed glasses in a nightclub until he is spotted by a porn movie director. Dirk then goes into the porn industry and his life gets turned upside down. It is a very entertaining story and very easy to follow. I would say this movie was a comedy. There were a lot of funny moments in it, as well as other serious moments, which gave it an element of drama. The cast list was amazing. I knew a few of these people were in it, but I didn't realise this many famous people were acting in it. The film starred Mark Wahlberg, the legendary Burt Reynolds, Julianne Moore, Heather Graham, John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle, William H. Macy & Phillip Seymour Hoffman. Everyone did an amazing job. It is not surprising that this film and the actors were nominated for so many awards, and even won a lot too. It felt like a bit or a roller coaster of a film. The emotions of the movie were all over the place. One minute I was laughing, then something would happen and it just shocked me. The drama kicked in... but then the comedy would come back. The film was set in the 70s and 80s... the clothes and hair was great. and the film also has a pretty good soundtrack. There was a lot of nudity in the film too. I don't know why I was surprised at this. After all, the film is about the porn industry... but for some reason I was shocked to see all these Hollywood actors and actresses flashing it all... and as for Mark Whalberg... he wishes his dong was that big! haha. Apparently, the fake willy that you saw at the end of the movie was given to Mark Wahlberg when filming was finished... he still owns it to this day... but it is not in the same condition anymore. haha. I will give this film 7 out of 10. I really liked it, and it really put me in a time machine and took me back to the 70s/80s. :) For more reviews, please like my Facebook page: https://www.facebook.com/pages/Ordinary-Person-Movie- Reviews/456572047728204?ref=hl

    I complained a lot about films in the '80s which were too stiff and self-conscious to pull off a period piece attempting to portray another decade. So what a relief it was when the '90s started and it was apparent the new decade wouldn't have the same problem. 1997's BOOGIE NIGHTS, about the porn industry of the late-'70s, is terrific fun for any number of reasons: the casting, the production design, the "period" style of the thing... Burt Reynolds plays a slightly pathetic porno-director at the end of the grainy, earthy sex-on-celluloid era which is about to be overtaken by the videotaped, sanitized, twinky zone of the '80s... Other actors are notable, including Heather Graham, Don Cheadle, Julianne Moore, etc. Oh, and how could one forget Philip Seymour Hoffman and his quivering boom-mike?? But Mark Wahlberg's casting makes the thing work, not simply because of his build (a lot of buff actors exist out there) but his demeanor--- his relaxed, lost, slightly forlorn, semi-arrogantly knuckle-headed vulnerability... he absolutely SCREAMS late-'70s teenager. (I'm not sure if Mr. Wahlberg has ever understood how "right" he got it with his performance). The movie, naturally, is a bit of a parody of the time, yet within that spirit of parody, gets the disco era much, much more right than it does wrong. Period zeitgeist is always made up of more than just mere physicality, and BOOGIE NIGHTS, through whatever method, manages to convince you that 1977 is actually 1977. And that's no small praise. There are some elements the film probably misses. When one recalls the late-'70s --- especially as it might relate to the sex/porn industry --- it's might be easy to ignore or forget its aspect of superlative sleaze; it was the time of early-Sex Pistols (before "real" punk got cleaned up in the '80s), CALIGULA, CRUISING, Studio 54 (no, not that terribly watered-down film with Ryan Phillippe years later) when a certain sexuality of degradation seemed to reach its apotheosis... If you side-step or miss that "sick" note of that time, you've almost missed the time... Admittedly, BOOGIE NIGHTS, deliberately or not, doesn't "get" that element; it's all a bit too giddy and innocent to do so (although that rings true, too). And yet I'm kind of glad it didn't go into that gutter; otherwise, the film would have likely slid into something else too unseemly, and the things it got right might have run the risk of being negated or overshadowed. A good, delightfully silly picture. And it's pretty impressive that PT Anderson, so young at the time, could pull this off so correctly.

    sexism , racism , species-ism , all are discriminating ideologies, they are heartless, sick and disgusting. you really really really need help or please go to jail so that clean innocent hearts are saved from your sick thoughts. I am so ashamed of people. hope you won't ever have children cause they would be as sick as you are. and: only whores would support whores(like the one who created the whore on this picture here) it is more than sad how sick people are today and destroy love day by day. good hearts like me just want to leave this sick world or start killing people (to fight against this cruelty) cause of exactly : this ...one big world, full of sexists and whores... say no to sexism beings are no objects we are living souls love is about the inner beauty, the heart, the character, not the body or sex. someone who thinks pictures like this, sexism and whores are OK, won't ever be able to give true deep love.

    Boogie Nights is another impressive work from Paul Thomas Anderson. Not only he captured the whole environment of the late 70s and early 80s very well, but he also he brought us memorable characters once again. I really enjoyed the fast cutting editing technique used by the director and how there were many fancy shots too. It was great to see the rise and fall of the main star Dirk Diggler and the path each of his colleagues took. In addition, it was interesting to follow the struggle of Jack Horner, the porn director, to accept the transition of shooting his movies on videotape instead of film and how the actors had to face prejudice and disapproval for being part of the porn industry. Boogie Nights has a lot of hilarious moments, managing to be constantly entertaining, but it's also a brutal and dramatic experience at times. A must-see!!

    So great movie, nice story .. but there were flaws which added extra B.S to the Movie,,,, No doubt the movie is good but the movie is so long which which becomes boring at certain point n makes you think of these certain scenes which were completely irrelevant. These are as follows Firstly useless characters like the guy shooting himself n his wife, the gay one, n the black guy .. their roles dint matter in the movie ... was in fact leading somewhere else. The Movie becomes boring when the director fires(not exactly) the main character .. This was just something to increase the movie timings nothing else .. but its better to work on quality rather than quantity N one more thing ... i don't think the movie name goes with the movie , if it had been the adventures of Dirk Diggler something like that, it would have been great .. Now coming to the GOOD POINTS .. it was good combination of Exotic n Erotic Scenes .. a couple scenes were very good n its always good to watch celebrity sex ... kind of gets u turn ON .. Most importantly it tells the history of Porn industry , how the golden era of porn changed through 1980's .. n the introduction of sex videotape well at the end i should tell u that i have gone too deep to provide my reviews n u may consider these flaws have been explained in to detail, so overall i consider it a good movie and a must watch movie i'll give it a 7.5/10 ..

    "Boogie Nights" is that remarkable achievement, a depiction of particularly ugly goings on made singularly watchable through vibrant direction and the sheer likability of an endearing cast. It's a sort of secular "Pilgrim's Progress" in which we follow the journey of Eddie, a high school dropout and dish-washing nobody to the heights of porn film acting by virtue of his super well-endowed cock, then to the depths as both he and his associates mess their lives up during a period of decline in their industry to a finale that gives just a little peek at their recovery. Clearly influenced by Scorsese (all those exhilarating tracking shots in and out of rooms in single takes) and Altman (the skillful manoeuvring of a large cast), Paul Thomas Anderson has fashioned a great ensemble piece that cleverly balances comedy and violence in a way that is genuinely funny in spite of the often shocking happenings. Burt Reynolds brilliantly plays Jack Horner the porn king who gathers into his entourage a troupe of grotesques that continuously delight. Particularly lovable are Rollergirl who never takes her skates off even when having sex, Julianne Moore who plays the motherly dope addict actress Amber and a remarkably young Philip Seymour Hoffman as the cuddly queer cameraman Scotty who has a crush on Eddie. When Eddie eventually f***s things up by rounding on benefactor Jack, our eyes are cleverly drawn away from the two main foreground protagonists to a distraught Scotty in a background group of onlookers. It's a wonderfully perceptive moment in a film full of small wonders and sometimes greater ones as when Eddie drinking with Jack and another friend, all half immersed in a vat of water at a party declares his chosen stage name to be Dirk Diggler. "I think heaven has sent you here, Dirk Diggler. I think the angels have blessed us all because of you" declares Jack. It is an almost spiritual cry of joy, the climax of what is for Anderson clearly a creative labour of love.

    "Boogie Nights" is one of those rare movies that manages to find the perfect balance between comedy and drama. I mean, there are a lot of laughs throughout, but you always laugh with a lump in your throat. This movie just bathes in a general feeling of false optimism: occasionally it looks like everyone's having the time of their life, but it's all just an illusion. Particularly the ending, which I can't go into too much detail about, captures that idea perfectly. At first it's pretty fulfilling, but the ending gets less happy with every second you think about it. Apart from being a great, bittersweet character study, the movie also creates tremendous amounts of tension when it needs to. The scene with the drug deal that goes awry might just be the most bone-chilling scene I've ever watched. Everything about it is just perfect, right down to the use of silly 80s pop songs as the soundtrack. I was drenched in sweat after watching that part, magnificent how it gradually builds up to its unexpected climax. The only bad thing I can really say about this movie is that the practical effect in the last shot is laughably unconvincing, but even that's not really a criticism given that I can imagine them doing it on purpose. Awesome movie, one of the best movies the 1990s had to offer.
