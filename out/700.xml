    One of the best movies by Woody Allen even if he himself did neither write it nor directed it nor starred in it, or, for that matter, has no direct role in making the movie whatsoever (as far as I know). I love almost all movies by Woody Allen and I love this imitation simply because it is not only an excellent imitation but also an excellent movie on its own. I wonder if there was a secret collaboration between Allen and David Frankel. I wouldn't be surprised if this were the case and what we are facing is an insider joke. Maybe in 1995 Allen was not yet ready to move his movies away from New York, and this is the product,

    Having read the redundant Allen references I must say I didn't have any while watching Miami Rhapsody. Ruth Gordon's name sprang to mind, though. She wrote many of the exceptional lines for women such as Katherine Hepburn. And spoke them in Harold and Maude (an absolutely brilliant and unique movie.) The wonderfully witty lines by all participants in this movie are highly clever and extremely well delivered. No particular fan of SJP lately, in this she was excellent! Beautiful, witty, funny and insightful! The epitome of what every woman is (when not pretending otherwise.) I love this little gem. And regret that others don't see its true worth. Today's movies are based on such different expectations, never realized and all made for those with lowered realities.

    Gwen (Sarah Jessica Parker) has a steady boyfriend and a great job at an advertising agency. But, that's not good enough for her parents. At her younger sister's wedding, the duo hound Gwen about setting a date for her own nuptials. To make peace, Gwen and her boyfriend go ahead and mark the calendar. However, in short order, Gwen learns that her own mother is having an affair with a male nurse (Antonio Banderas). And, that's not all. Perhaps there are more family members indulging in extra-marital activities. Does Gwen's potential marriage have a snowball's chance in Miami? This is a terrific film, very funny and very clever. The script is awesome, as, for example, Gwen asks her mother why she is involved with a nurse, "you mean, not even a doctor?". That's just one line but the movie is loaded with them, to the point of infinite joy. Parker has her finest hour, even considering where she has gone since the film was made. Her Gwen is lovely, funny, brilliant and acerbic. The rest of the cast is also quite wonderful, with Mia Farrow, Gil Bellows, Carla Gugino, Kevin Pollack, Jeremy Piven and more. The Miami setting is exotic and beautiful, the costumes are first-rate, and the production values are mighty. If you have somehow let this film pass you by, rectify that mistake. Head to the library or video store at once, even if you are supposed to be working, and sit down to laughs and laughs in abundance.

    and well-directed. Anyone who has ever lived in or visited South Florida will enjoy this film. Sarah Jessica Parker is very good, and I am not really an ardent fan of "Sex and the City". Mia Farrow and Paul Mazursky portray an older well-to-do Miami couple: ..."what shall I decorate the den in, sea foam or teal"..., Mia wonders. While lines like that could seem vacuous, they are humorous when presented in an intelligent way. Infidelity, boredom, job frustration. SJP has some excellent lines, like when she tells her grandmother ..."your generation had something to fight against Nazis...what does my generation have?"... . Also when she is demoted at her job, her boss tells her not to buy into the "glass-ceiling theory"; she says, as a woman I don't have to buy it I get it for free everyday. Anyone who has ever worked in the superficial world of advertising will get a few laughs. Antonio Banderas is also in a small part, as Farrow's paramour. This film deserves a watch, especially because there are so few intelligent romantic comedies. Definitely worth it.

Of course Mia Farrow, who plays Parker's mother, is one of the principals - that can't have anything to do with the similarity of writing style. Antonio Banderas was fun in his part as male nurse and so were the scenes of South Beach. If you're nostalgic for Miami then it's a good rental. But probably you're better off just watching "Hannah and Her Sisters" again.

    Thin, but enjoyable romp involving a young, unmarried Jewish woman and her married family and friends--all of whom seem to be miserable and cheating on each other. Ersatz Woody Allen, as it aspires to be, but not quite on the level of, say, "Hannah and Her Sisters". Odd to see Mia Farrow here (playing Sarah Jessica Parker's mother), as this is basically a retread of the work she was doing with Allen earlier in the decade. Parker is infectious, rattling off the sometimes-precious lines with professional aplomb, supporting cast is quite colorful, yet this tale doesn't have much of a point, and as a film it has no motivation beyond aping Allen. **1/2 from ****

    I would disagree with the previous user comment. Miami Rhapsody was both funny and intelligent. Indeed it saunters along with the rhythm of a Woody Allen flick but this is simply because it captures characters in dialouge rarely heard in most Hollywood films. Furthermore...it was truly refreshing to get to see Sarah Jessica Parker in a role (pre-Sex in the City) that really uses her talents as both as comedian and dramatist. It was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment. We may think it is overdone now with the re-runs of Sex in the City and all...but put yourself back in 1995. So Yeah...I liked it.

    Americans think that actresses speaking with an English accent must be acting. Poor Naomi Campbell falls victim to this syndrome. She can't act, and doesn't even know where the camera is. And while we're on the subject of the two nations divided by a common language -- Mia, Kenneth Branagh rhymes with "manna"; the G is silent. Loved the film. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx

    This is Sex and the City set in Miami. Sarah Jessica Parker does exactly the same thing she does when she's Carrie. Sit at a laptop, go on dates (even though she's engaged) and ponder about life whilst comparing it to friends and families. It's like if Sex and The City and The Royal tenenbaums met each other in a more realistic way. Antonio Banderas, Mia Farrow and Jordan Marcus are very entertaing also. However Naomi Campbell isn't. So thank god her screen time is just under 5 minutes. It's a good entertaining movie though and funny in parts. I recommend it.

    Gwyn and Matt have finally gotten engaged and it looks like she will get what she wanted - a happy marriage just like the rest of her family. However as she looks around with clear eyes she realises that all her family are involved in bad marriages and affairs. As a result she begins to get cold feet, worried the same will happen to her. From the style and music of the opening credits right through to the to-camera conclusion that mirrors the `need the eggs', this film is like a tropical version of Annie Hall with a female playing the Woody Allen role! Even if it is not a total mirror, it is impossible to watch this film without seeing Allen's influence all over it. So immediately large sections of the audience will want to turn off, however I love Allen so am happy to give this a shot on that basis alone. As a film, it's plot is just a collection of messy relationship through which Carrie, sorry, Gwyn learns lessons. It isn't substance rich but that's the point - instead it is quick and rather witty, never sitting still for very long but being quite fun with it. The cast also helps as they do some very fun turns despite some weaknesses. Parker is good and her New York personae certainly seems to fit the material. Bellows is rather bland for the role but there are some great little bits from Banderas, Farrow and Mazursky. It's always good to see Pollack and Piven but Campbell demonstrates why she hasn't moved into a successful film career by reading her lines with all the emotion of iron (although she looked great in the beach-shoot scene). Overall this is a fun little film that is quite slick if you are a fan of Woody Allen's relationship neurosis films. If you're not then you'll probably do well to avoid this film.

    I was distracted while watching this movie by the nagging sense that Woody Allen had written the screenplay, but for some reason declined a credit. Parker's lead character talked like Allen, made some "throw-away" cracks muttered ala Allen - the whole thing was disconcerting. Of course Mia Farrow, who plays Parker's mother, is one of the principals - that can't have anything to do with the similarity of writing style. Antonio Banderas was fun in his part as male nurse and so were the scenes of South Beach. If you're nostalgic for Miami then it's a good rental. But probably you're better off just watching "Hannah and Her Sisters" again.

    Thin, but enjoyable romp involving a young, unmarried Jewish woman and her married family and friends--all of whom seem to be miserable and cheating on each other. Ersatz Woody Allen, as it aspires to be, but not quite on the level of, say, "Hannah and Her Sisters". Odd to see Mia Farrow here (playing Sarah Jessica Parker's mother), as this is basically a retread of the work she was doing with Allen earlier in the decade. Parker is infectious, rattling off the sometimes-precious lines with professional aplomb, supporting cast is quite colorful, yet this tale doesn't have much of a point, and as a film it has no motivation beyond aping Allen. **1/2 from ****

    I would disagree with the previous user comment. Miami Rhapsody was both funny and intelligent. Indeed it saunters along with the rhythm of a Woody Allen flick but this is simply because it captures characters in dialouge rarely heard in most Hollywood films. Furthermore...it was truly refreshing to get to see Sarah Jessica Parker in a role (pre-Sex in the City) that really uses her talents as both as comedian and dramatist. It was super refreshing to see a neurotic thinking womens role that toyed with the notion of marriage and commitment. We may think it is overdone now with the re-runs of Sex in the City and all...but put yourself back in 1995. So Yeah...I liked it.

    Americans think that actresses speaking with an English accent must be acting. Poor Naomi Campbell falls victim to this syndrome. She can't act, and doesn't even know where the camera is. And while we're on the subject of the two nations divided by a common language -- Mia, Kenneth Branagh rhymes with "manna"; the G is silent. Loved the film. xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx

    This is Sex and the City set in Miami. Sarah Jessica Parker does exactly the same thing she does when she's Carrie. Sit at a laptop, go on dates (even though she's engaged) and ponder about life whilst comparing it to friends and families. It's like if Sex and The City and The Royal tenenbaums met each other in a more realistic way. Antonio Banderas, Mia Farrow and Jordan Marcus are very entertaing also. However Naomi Campbell isn't. So thank god her screen time is just under 5 minutes. It's a good entertaining movie though and funny in parts. I recommend it.

    Gwyn and Matt have finally gotten engaged and it looks like she will get what she wanted - a happy marriage just like the rest of her family. However as she looks around with clear eyes she realises that all her family are involved in bad marriages and affairs. As a result she begins to get cold feet, worried the same will happen to her. From the style and music of the opening credits right through to the to-camera conclusion that mirrors the `need the eggs', this film is like a tropical version of Annie Hall with a female playing the Woody Allen role! Even if it is not a total mirror, it is impossible to watch this film without seeing Allen's influence all over it. So immediately large sections of the audience will want to turn off, however I love Allen so am happy to give this a shot on that basis alone. As a film, it's plot is just a collection of messy relationship through which Carrie, sorry, Gwyn learns lessons. It isn't substance rich but that's the point - instead it is quick and rather witty, never sitting still for very long but being quite fun with it. The cast also helps as they do some very fun turns despite some weaknesses. Parker is good and her New York personae certainly seems to fit the material. Bellows is rather bland for the role but there are some great little bits from Banderas, Farrow and Mazursky. It's always good to see Pollack and Piven but Campbell demonstrates why she hasn't moved into a successful film career by reading her lines with all the emotion of iron (although she looked great in the beach-shoot scene). Overall this is a fun little film that is quite slick if you are a fan of Woody Allen's relationship neurosis films. If you're not then you'll probably do well to avoid this film.
