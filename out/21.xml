    The Muppets gang try on this classic story with pirate treasure. It's got the irreverent sense of humor. That's definitely the good part of this movie. The less good is the bland boy lead Kevin Bishop. He's acceptable but just nothing special. The same can be said of the songs. It's just not memorable. The biggest sin of this movie must be the late entrance of both Kermit and Miss Piggy. How dare they treat Kermit as a secondary character. And Miss Piggy doesn't even get in till much much much later. That's a crime against pigmanity. I was wondering if they cut her out entirely.

    Like the rest of the Muppet movies my family and I have on video, I remember seeing them all as a kid, but there was a long period I didn't watch it for a while. My earliest memory of watching the movie was in the fifth grade. I thought it was OK. After a long while, I saw all of these videos on video again, during my high school years. I loved this film - it was my second favorite Muppet movie! Watching it now as an adult, I think it's good, but I don't think it's as good as I thought it was during my high school years. First of all, it's hard for me to talk about this movie without comparing it to their last movie, "The Muppet Christmas Carol." They're almost the exact same movie, production wise that is. Think about it: they were made by the same film companies (Walt Disney Pictures & Jim Henson Productions); they're both based on classic books written by nineteenth-century English writers; the Muppets are sharing the spotlight with live British actors; and they're both made almost the exact same people. Really! Look at the back of the video, DVD, or Blu-ray cases of these movies. They have the same writers, producers, director, editor, director of photographer, etc.! In fear that his legendary treasure map will fall in the wrong hands, Billy Bones gives the map to young Jim Hawkins. He and his friends, Gonzo and Rizzo, go to central England to find someone to fund the voyage to the treasure. Once this happens, they load the boat and meet the colorful characters on board: Long John Silver, his pet lobster Polly, Samuel Arrow, and Captain Abraham Smollett. What they don't know is Long John and the other pirates on board are planning on committing mutiny and taking the treasure for themselves. Like "The Muppets Christmas Carol," the movie follows the story pretty well. There are things that are changed around here (in fact I think this movie follows the book less than it does in the last movie), but you get the idea of the story. Another comparison between the two films is the Muppets share the spotlight with live actors, especially Tim Curry. Again, it's kind of weird, but it works OK. However, there is a difference between the two movies that makes me appreciate the other movie more than this one. The humor from "The Muppet Christmas Carol" created itself. It came based on the characters and situations as they occurred. Here, there are a lot of references to modern entertainment and pop culture. They reference the NBA, shopping networks, and Disneyland (or Disneyworld). For me, that's kind of annoying. The magic of "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is that they stayed in their time period. The story and the movie both are timeless enough to last forever; they don't mention anything that spoke into the popularity of the time the story was written, and the movie doesn't reference to anything in modern pop culture either - they just tell the story. Here, we're taken out of the magic because of the modern references. To be honest, that's my biggest problem with the movie. I think I'd enjoy the movie just as much as I did as a teenager if it weren't for those references. What do I like about the movie? This is something I should have mentioned in my review for "The Muppet Christmas Carol," but I like the world that's created here for the Muppets. What I mean by that is the Muppets live right beside the live humans here. In the earlier Muppet movies, the Muppets were always together. It was as if they lived together as a group, and the rest of the world had live humans, as if the Muppets were the odd ones. Here, the Muppets live right beside the humans. They live with them, they live like them, they live and walk in the same communities, the work together - much like the world created on "Sesame Street." I also like the relationship between Long John and Jim. It seems really genuine. You buy that these two are buddies. And, like in their last movie, I like that this movie has some dark moments (this one probably goes darker than the previous ones), and it's balanced with a some light-hearted moments. The songs are...OK. I love "Shiver My Timbers" and "Something More Than This." The other songs are OK, though "Love Led Us Here" seems really weird for this movie...or for the scene it was played in. I don't know, something seemed weird about it. In closing, I like this movie. I think it's a good movie that tells the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" pretty well. It's a nice way to introduce the story to kids, and see the Muppets take on this story. Take a look and judge for yourself. BOOYIKA!

    As far as quality goes, the Muppet films are all over the board. From mediocre entries such as Muppets From Space and The Muppet Christmas Carol, to masterpieces like The Muppets Take Manhattan and the 2011 reboot, you can never tell whether you're about to watch dull puppet wizardry, or a new favorite film. Unfortunately, Muppet Treasure Island ranks among the very worst of the Muppet films, and that is a downright shame. Following the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island, Muppet Treasure Island is about a boy named Jim Hawkins, who with his friends Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo, as well as a host of other characters, go in search of buried treasure. Of course, their journey will not be without peril, as a dastardly plot concocted by pirates awaits the crew. Muppet Treasure Island is dreadfully dull most of the time. Gags are bland and uninspired, dialogue is mostly the same. While there are a handful of amusing bits here and there, they don't come nearly often enough. Some smiles, one or two chuckles, and not a single belly laugh. To make things worse, Muppet Treasure Island has a grand total of seven songs, and almost none of which are appealing. "Shiver My Timbers," "Sailing for Adventure," "Professional Pirate," and "Boom Shakalaka," fall under the mediocre/forgettable/inoffensive category. "Something Better," and "Love Led Us Here," are absolutely awful ("Something Better" may have been less painful had it not been for Kevin Bishop's high pitched and highly annoying singing voice). The only decent song in the whole film is "Cabin Fever," which is actually quite fun and is the highlight of the film. Like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island is much more human involved than the other Muppet films. This is a shame considering that the Muppet characters are so much more entertaining. And it doesn't help that the actors behind the human characters perform less than satisfactorily. Kevin Bishop, playing the child lead, is clunky as an actor, though I've seen worse. The thing that really makes his part in Muppet Treasure Island nearly unbearable is his extremely high voice. Tim Curry plays Long John Silver. He's intentionally dramatic and over the top, but this is more obnoxious than comedic. Billy Connolly gets a small part as Billy Bones that's forgettable, but not poor. The score for Muppet Treasure Island is composed by Hans Zimmer. The score makes up one of the least offensive parts about this film. It's not particularly interesting most of the time, but it's occasionally rousing. Though Muppet Treasure Island tries hard, it's the worst of the Muppet films, and simply awful. It's rarely funny, hardly amusing, and poorly acted. Though the musical number, "Cabin Fever" is fun, and the breaking of the "fourth wall" provides a few smiles, Muppet Treasure Island lacks the enchantment and joy of the series' best entries. It's also surprisingly violent (and profane) for a G-rated flick, but in a film as dull as this, that's the least of it's problems.

    I remember watching this movie probably when it first came out and then every once in a while on the Disney Channel. I remember laughing every time. Eventually the movie slipped my mind and I hadn't watched it for about 6 years. When I rediscovered it I fell in love all over again! This movie is fantastic and very memorable. I read reviews about Muppet Treasure Island and it seems that it gets overlooked or is underrated. Any Muppet fan needs to see this movie, you will love it. Tim Curry as Long John Silver is wonderful. You can see how much fun he is having with the role. He put his heart into that role and has even been quoted as saying that this role is one of his favorites that he has ever done. Being able to act along puppets and make them seem real by interactions seems like a tough job and Tim Curry pulls it off wonderfully. The songs, cast, writing, jokes and everything with this movie makes it a classic for any Muppet fan of any age. My 4 year old cousin picks this movie whenever she can and she dances and laughs at the movie. 10/10 for any Muppet fan!

    Director Brian Henson gives us the fifth Muppet movie with Muppet Treasure Island. The film follows Jim Hawkins played by Kevin Bishop receiving a treasure map after his father Billy Bones played by Billy Connely dies. Jim meets Long John Silver played by Tim Curry who wants the map for himself. The muppets are really funny in this film, the musical performances are spot on, and Tim Curry is as encentric as ever. Although in this film The muppets really don't have a lot to work with, the film is a little to violent for small children, and Miss Piggy does not show up until 1hr 6min in the movie. Despite all the negatives i still recommend this film. Rated G. 1hr 40min/100min. ***/****

    I saw this movie a over ten years ago, when I was little in fact, and I have never thought of the classic story in the same way again! This movie has been a really important part of my childhood, I watched it several times over after I saw it for the first time! I have a big sense of humor, and I have always been a big fan of the the Muppets created by Jim Henson. And so I thought that this movie was great, hysterical, and on the whole, a very good way to spend the evening with the family. I remember that my sister and my mother would watch this movie with me a few times, and they were both laughing and laughing with me! This movie is 100% great, there is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie, nothing negative at all, not one single thing, not one! This movie is the best comedy of 1996, and it is also one of the best movies of 1996, but that is not all, I also rank it as one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time for a few years, until I began to see many of the great classics of the earlier decades. This movie's humor is so hilariously funny that in just about every single scene (except for the serious parts) I couldn't stop laughing! I love a movie with good humor, and this movie's humor is not good, it is great! I believe that if Jim Henson had lived long enough to see the release of this movie, he would have probably been thrilled with it! Getting back to my review, I thought that this movie was great! Is it a masterpiece of filming? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I have ever seen? No. Is it one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life? No. Is it very hysterical and fun to watch? Yes! So in short, this is a very funny movie that is hard not to laugh at! You should watch it if you haven't, you'll laugh at it a lot! When you watch this hysterical movie, you just won't be able to stop laughing! You should take the time to watch this movie, because you will be laughing yourself silly! This movie is like a carnival ride all the way through from start to finish! So join the Muppets and get ready for the best comedy of 1996, Muppet Treasure Island! Trust me, when you see this movie, you are never going to think of Treasure Island in the same way again! So watch this movie and enjoy it, because you are just not going to be able to stop laughing! This movie is hysterical and is one of the funniest of the 1990's! 10/10

    'Muppet Treasure Island' is a 1996 film released by Walt Disney Pictures (second released by Disney after 'The Muppet Christmas Carol') and Jim Henson Productions, based on the novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (Ben Gunn in the book) and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins. A tale as only the Muppets can tell, they set sail for a treasure with a crew of cutthroat pirates and scallywags. This is in fact, the first and only Muppet film where someone dies (Billy Bones played by Billy Connolly at the hotel). Tim Curry is genius as the notorious Long John Silver, he plays the part well. Altogether, this film is worth the watch, but not the best film of the Muppet franchise. It deserves a solid 9 out of 10. Kids will most likely enjoy the film, as will some adults who enjoy the Muppets.

    This is the fifth theatrical Muppet movie, and the second one made after creator Jim Henson's premature death. For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is an adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens and "Muppet Treasure Island" is an adaptation of "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings. Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the "one-legged man!" Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, "Shiver My Timbers". I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of. This was the Muppets' last feature film before "Muppets From Space", their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after "Muppet Treasure Island". Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets. The other five are good, even though some are better than others, and "The Muppet Movie" is probably the best of them all. As the Muppets' second flick made after Jim Henson's sad passing, "Muppet Treasure Island" may not be as good as the first 90's film featuring the famous puppets, but at least it comes very close. I know it's far from being the most popular film in the franchise, but I thought it was a good family adventure movie when I was around ten years old and still do now.

    The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "Hollywood clich&eacute;". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich&eacute;s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.

Of course, their journey will not be without peril, as a dastardly plot concocted by pirates awaits the crew. Muppet Treasure Island is dreadfully dull most of the time. Gags are bland and uninspired, dialogue is mostly the same. While there are a handful of amusing bits here and there, they don't come nearly often enough. Some smiles, one or two chuckles, and not a single belly laugh. To make things worse, Muppet Treasure Island has a grand total of seven songs, and almost none of which are appealing. "Shiver My Timbers," "Sailing for Adventure," "Professional Pirate," and "Boom Shakalaka," fall under the mediocre/forgettable/inoffensive category. "Something Better," and "Love Led Us Here," are absolutely awful ("Something Better" may have been less painful had it not been for Kevin Bishop's high pitched and highly annoying singing voice). The only decent song in the whole film is "Cabin Fever," which is actually quite fun and is the highlight of the film. Like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island is much more human involved than the other Muppet films. This is a shame considering that the Muppet characters are so much more entertaining. And it doesn't help that the actors behind the human characters perform less than satisfactorily. Kevin Bishop, playing the child lead, is clunky as an actor, though I've seen worse. The thing that really makes his part in Muppet Treasure Island nearly unbearable is his extremely high voice. Tim Curry plays Long John Silver. He's intentionally dramatic and over the top, but this is more obnoxious than comedic. Billy Connolly gets a small part as Billy Bones that's forgettable, but not poor. The score for Muppet Treasure Island is composed by Hans Zimmer. The score makes up one of the least offensive parts about this film. It's not particularly interesting most of the time, but it's occasionally rousing. Though Muppet Treasure Island tries hard, it's the worst of the Muppet films, and simply awful. It's rarely funny, hardly amusing, and poorly acted. Though the musical number, "Cabin Fever" is fun, and the breaking of the "fourth wall" provides a few smiles, Muppet Treasure Island lacks the enchantment and joy of the series' best entries. It's also surprisingly violent (and profane) for a G-rated flick, but in a film as dull as this, that's the least of it's problems.

    I remember watching this movie probably when it first came out and then every once in a while on the Disney Channel. I remember laughing every time. Eventually the movie slipped my mind and I hadn't watched it for about 6 years. When I rediscovered it I fell in love all over again! This movie is fantastic and very memorable. I read reviews about Muppet Treasure Island and it seems that it gets overlooked or is underrated. Any Muppet fan needs to see this movie, you will love it. Tim Curry as Long John Silver is wonderful. You can see how much fun he is having with the role. He put his heart into that role and has even been quoted as saying that this role is one of his favorites that he has ever done. Being able to act along puppets and make them seem real by interactions seems like a tough job and Tim Curry pulls it off wonderfully. The songs, cast, writing, jokes and everything with this movie makes it a classic for any Muppet fan of any age. My 4 year old cousin picks this movie whenever she can and she dances and laughs at the movie. 10/10 for any Muppet fan!

    Director Brian Henson gives us the fifth Muppet movie with Muppet Treasure Island. The film follows Jim Hawkins played by Kevin Bishop receiving a treasure map after his father Billy Bones played by Billy Connely dies. Jim meets Long John Silver played by Tim Curry who wants the map for himself. The muppets are really funny in this film, the musical performances are spot on, and Tim Curry is as encentric as ever. Although in this film The muppets really don't have a lot to work with, the film is a little to violent for small children, and Miss Piggy does not show up until 1hr 6min in the movie. Despite all the negatives i still recommend this film. Rated G. 1hr 40min/100min. ***/****

    I saw this movie a over ten years ago, when I was little in fact, and I have never thought of the classic story in the same way again! This movie has been a really important part of my childhood, I watched it several times over after I saw it for the first time! I have a big sense of humor, and I have always been a big fan of the the Muppets created by Jim Henson. And so I thought that this movie was great, hysterical, and on the whole, a very good way to spend the evening with the family. I remember that my sister and my mother would watch this movie with me a few times, and they were both laughing and laughing with me! This movie is 100% great, there is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie, nothing negative at all, not one single thing, not one! This movie is the best comedy of 1996, and it is also one of the best movies of 1996, but that is not all, I also rank it as one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time for a few years, until I began to see many of the great classics of the earlier decades. This movie's humor is so hilariously funny that in just about every single scene (except for the serious parts) I couldn't stop laughing! I love a movie with good humor, and this movie's humor is not good, it is great! I believe that if Jim Henson had lived long enough to see the release of this movie, he would have probably been thrilled with it! Getting back to my review, I thought that this movie was great! Is it a masterpiece of filming? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I have ever seen? No. Is it one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life? No. Is it very hysterical and fun to watch? Yes! So in short, this is a very funny movie that is hard not to laugh at! You should watch it if you haven't, you'll laugh at it a lot! When you watch this hysterical movie, you just won't be able to stop laughing! You should take the time to watch this movie, because you will be laughing yourself silly! This movie is like a carnival ride all the way through from start to finish! So join the Muppets and get ready for the best comedy of 1996, Muppet Treasure Island! Trust me, when you see this movie, you are never going to think of Treasure Island in the same way again! So watch this movie and enjoy it, because you are just not going to be able to stop laughing! This movie is hysterical and is one of the funniest of the 1990's! 10/10

    'Muppet Treasure Island' is a 1996 film released by Walt Disney Pictures (second released by Disney after 'The Muppet Christmas Carol') and Jim Henson Productions, based on the novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (Ben Gunn in the book) and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins. A tale as only the Muppets can tell, they set sail for a treasure with a crew of cutthroat pirates and scallywags. This is in fact, the first and only Muppet film where someone dies (Billy Bones played by Billy Connolly at the hotel). Tim Curry is genius as the notorious Long John Silver, he plays the part well. Altogether, this film is worth the watch, but not the best film of the Muppet franchise. It deserves a solid 9 out of 10. Kids will most likely enjoy the film, as will some adults who enjoy the Muppets.

    This is the fifth theatrical Muppet movie, and the second one made after creator Jim Henson's premature death. For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is an adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens and "Muppet Treasure Island" is an adaptation of "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings. Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the "one-legged man!" Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, "Shiver My Timbers". I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of. This was the Muppets' last feature film before "Muppets From Space", their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after "Muppet Treasure Island". Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets. The other five are good, even though some are better than others, and "The Muppet Movie" is probably the best of them all. As the Muppets' second flick made after Jim Henson's sad passing, "Muppet Treasure Island" may not be as good as the first 90's film featuring the famous puppets, but at least it comes very close. I know it's far from being the most popular film in the franchise, but I thought it was a good family adventure movie when I was around ten years old and still do now.

    The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "Hollywood clich&eacute;". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich&eacute;s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.

    The Muppets gang try on this classic story with pirate treasure. It's got the irreverent sense of humor. That's definitely the good part of this movie. The less good is the bland boy lead Kevin Bishop. He's acceptable but just nothing special. The same can be said of the songs. It's just not memorable. The biggest sin of this movie must be the late entrance of both Kermit and Miss Piggy. How dare they treat Kermit as a secondary character. And Miss Piggy doesn't even get in till much much much later. That's a crime against pigmanity. I was wondering if they cut her out entirely.

    Like the rest of the Muppet movies my family and I have on video, I remember seeing them all as a kid, but there was a long period I didn't watch it for a while. My earliest memory of watching the movie was in the fifth grade. I thought it was OK. After a long while, I saw all of these videos on video again, during my high school years. I loved this film - it was my second favorite Muppet movie! Watching it now as an adult, I think it's good, but I don't think it's as good as I thought it was during my high school years. First of all, it's hard for me to talk about this movie without comparing it to their last movie, "The Muppet Christmas Carol." They're almost the exact same movie, production wise that is. Think about it: they were made by the same film companies (Walt Disney Pictures & Jim Henson Productions); they're both based on classic books written by nineteenth-century English writers; the Muppets are sharing the spotlight with live British actors; and they're both made almost the exact same people. Really! Look at the back of the video, DVD, or Blu-ray cases of these movies. They have the same writers, producers, director, editor, director of photographer, etc.! In fear that his legendary treasure map will fall in the wrong hands, Billy Bones gives the map to young Jim Hawkins. He and his friends, Gonzo and Rizzo, go to central England to find someone to fund the voyage to the treasure. Once this happens, they load the boat and meet the colorful characters on board: Long John Silver, his pet lobster Polly, Samuel Arrow, and Captain Abraham Smollett. What they don't know is Long John and the other pirates on board are planning on committing mutiny and taking the treasure for themselves. Like "The Muppets Christmas Carol," the movie follows the story pretty well. There are things that are changed around here (in fact I think this movie follows the book less than it does in the last movie), but you get the idea of the story. Another comparison between the two films is the Muppets share the spotlight with live actors, especially Tim Curry. Again, it's kind of weird, but it works OK. However, there is a difference between the two movies that makes me appreciate the other movie more than this one. The humor from "The Muppet Christmas Carol" created itself. It came based on the characters and situations as they occurred. Here, there are a lot of references to modern entertainment and pop culture. They reference the NBA, shopping networks, and Disneyland (or Disneyworld). For me, that's kind of annoying. The magic of "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is that they stayed in their time period. The story and the movie both are timeless enough to last forever; they don't mention anything that spoke into the popularity of the time the story was written, and the movie doesn't reference to anything in modern pop culture either - they just tell the story. Here, we're taken out of the magic because of the modern references. To be honest, that's my biggest problem with the movie. I think I'd enjoy the movie just as much as I did as a teenager if it weren't for those references. What do I like about the movie? This is something I should have mentioned in my review for "The Muppet Christmas Carol," but I like the world that's created here for the Muppets. What I mean by that is the Muppets live right beside the live humans here. In the earlier Muppet movies, the Muppets were always together. It was as if they lived together as a group, and the rest of the world had live humans, as if the Muppets were the odd ones. Here, the Muppets live right beside the humans. They live with them, they live like them, they live and walk in the same communities, the work together - much like the world created on "Sesame Street." I also like the relationship between Long John and Jim. It seems really genuine. You buy that these two are buddies. And, like in their last movie, I like that this movie has some dark moments (this one probably goes darker than the previous ones), and it's balanced with a some light-hearted moments. The songs are...OK. I love "Shiver My Timbers" and "Something More Than This." The other songs are OK, though "Love Led Us Here" seems really weird for this movie...or for the scene it was played in. I don't know, something seemed weird about it. In closing, I like this movie. I think it's a good movie that tells the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" pretty well. It's a nice way to introduce the story to kids, and see the Muppets take on this story. Take a look and judge for yourself. BOOYIKA!

    As far as quality goes, the Muppet films are all over the board. From mediocre entries such as Muppets From Space and The Muppet Christmas Carol, to masterpieces like The Muppets Take Manhattan and the 2011 reboot, you can never tell whether you're about to watch dull puppet wizardry, or a new favorite film. Unfortunately, Muppet Treasure Island ranks among the very worst of the Muppet films, and that is a downright shame. Following the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island, Muppet Treasure Island is about a boy named Jim Hawkins, who with his friends Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo, as well as a host of other characters, go in search of buried treasure.

    'Muppet Treasure Island' is a 1996 film released by Walt Disney Pictures (second released by Disney after 'The Muppet Christmas Carol') and Jim Henson Productions, based on the novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (Ben Gunn in the book) and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins. A tale as only the Muppets can tell, they set sail for a treasure with a crew of cutthroat pirates and scallywags. This is in fact, the first and only Muppet film where someone dies (Billy Bones played by Billy Connolly at the hotel). Tim Curry is genius as the notorious Long John Silver, he plays the part well. Altogether, this film is worth the watch, but not the best film of the Muppet franchise. It deserves a solid 9 out of 10. Kids will most likely enjoy the film, as will some adults who enjoy the Muppets.

    This is the fifth theatrical Muppet movie, and the second one made after creator Jim Henson's premature death. For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is an adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens and "Muppet Treasure Island" is an adaptation of "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings. Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the "one-legged man!" Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, "Shiver My Timbers". I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of. This was the Muppets' last feature film before "Muppets From Space", their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after "Muppet Treasure Island". Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets. The other five are good, even though some are better than others, and "The Muppet Movie" is probably the best of them all. As the Muppets' second flick made after Jim Henson's sad passing, "Muppet Treasure Island" may not be as good as the first 90's film featuring the famous puppets, but at least it comes very close. I know it's far from being the most popular film in the franchise, but I thought it was a good family adventure movie when I was around ten years old and still do now.

    The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "Hollywood clich&eacute;". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich&eacute;s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.

    The Muppets gang try on this classic story with pirate treasure. It's got the irreverent sense of humor. That's definitely the good part of this movie. The less good is the bland boy lead Kevin Bishop. He's acceptable but just nothing special. The same can be said of the songs. It's just not memorable. The biggest sin of this movie must be the late entrance of both Kermit and Miss Piggy. How dare they treat Kermit as a secondary character. And Miss Piggy doesn't even get in till much much much later. That's a crime against pigmanity. I was wondering if they cut her out entirely.

    Like the rest of the Muppet movies my family and I have on video, I remember seeing them all as a kid, but there was a long period I didn't watch it for a while. My earliest memory of watching the movie was in the fifth grade. I thought it was OK. After a long while, I saw all of these videos on video again, during my high school years. I loved this film - it was my second favorite Muppet movie! Watching it now as an adult, I think it's good, but I don't think it's as good as I thought it was during my high school years. First of all, it's hard for me to talk about this movie without comparing it to their last movie, "The Muppet Christmas Carol." They're almost the exact same movie, production wise that is. Think about it: they were made by the same film companies (Walt Disney Pictures & Jim Henson Productions); they're both based on classic books written by nineteenth-century English writers; the Muppets are sharing the spotlight with live British actors; and they're both made almost the exact same people. Really! Look at the back of the video, DVD, or Blu-ray cases of these movies. They have the same writers, producers, director, editor, director of photographer, etc.! In fear that his legendary treasure map will fall in the wrong hands, Billy Bones gives the map to young Jim Hawkins. He and his friends, Gonzo and Rizzo, go to central England to find someone to fund the voyage to the treasure. Once this happens, they load the boat and meet the colorful characters on board: Long John Silver, his pet lobster Polly, Samuel Arrow, and Captain Abraham Smollett. What they don't know is Long John and the other pirates on board are planning on committing mutiny and taking the treasure for themselves. Like "The Muppets Christmas Carol," the movie follows the story pretty well. There are things that are changed around here (in fact I think this movie follows the book less than it does in the last movie), but you get the idea of the story. Another comparison between the two films is the Muppets share the spotlight with live actors, especially Tim Curry. Again, it's kind of weird, but it works OK. However, there is a difference between the two movies that makes me appreciate the other movie more than this one. The humor from "The Muppet Christmas Carol" created itself. It came based on the characters and situations as they occurred. Here, there are a lot of references to modern entertainment and pop culture. They reference the NBA, shopping networks, and Disneyland (or Disneyworld). For me, that's kind of annoying. The magic of "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is that they stayed in their time period. The story and the movie both are timeless enough to last forever; they don't mention anything that spoke into the popularity of the time the story was written, and the movie doesn't reference to anything in modern pop culture either - they just tell the story. Here, we're taken out of the magic because of the modern references. To be honest, that's my biggest problem with the movie. I think I'd enjoy the movie just as much as I did as a teenager if it weren't for those references. What do I like about the movie? This is something I should have mentioned in my review for "The Muppet Christmas Carol," but I like the world that's created here for the Muppets. What I mean by that is the Muppets live right beside the live humans here. In the earlier Muppet movies, the Muppets were always together. It was as if they lived together as a group, and the rest of the world had live humans, as if the Muppets were the odd ones. Here, the Muppets live right beside the humans. They live with them, they live like them, they live and walk in the same communities, the work together - much like the world created on "Sesame Street." I also like the relationship between Long John and Jim. It seems really genuine. You buy that these two are buddies. And, like in their last movie, I like that this movie has some dark moments (this one probably goes darker than the previous ones), and it's balanced with a some light-hearted moments. The songs are...OK. I love "Shiver My Timbers" and "Something More Than This." The other songs are OK, though "Love Led Us Here" seems really weird for this movie...or for the scene it was played in. I don't know, something seemed weird about it. In closing, I like this movie. I think it's a good movie that tells the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" pretty well. It's a nice way to introduce the story to kids, and see the Muppets take on this story. Take a look and judge for yourself. BOOYIKA!

    As far as quality goes, the Muppet films are all over the board. From mediocre entries such as Muppets From Space and The Muppet Christmas Carol, to masterpieces like The Muppets Take Manhattan and the 2011 reboot, you can never tell whether you're about to watch dull puppet wizardry, or a new favorite film. Unfortunately, Muppet Treasure Island ranks among the very worst of the Muppet films, and that is a downright shame. Following the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island, Muppet Treasure Island is about a boy named Jim Hawkins, who with his friends Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo, as well as a host of other characters, go in search of buried treasure. Of course, their journey will not be without peril, as a dastardly plot concocted by pirates awaits the crew. Muppet Treasure Island is dreadfully dull most of the time. Gags are bland and uninspired, dialogue is mostly the same. While there are a handful of amusing bits here and there, they don't come nearly often enough. Some smiles, one or two chuckles, and not a single belly laugh. To make things worse, Muppet Treasure Island has a grand total of seven songs, and almost none of which are appealing. "Shiver My Timbers," "Sailing for Adventure," "Professional Pirate," and "Boom Shakalaka," fall under the mediocre/forgettable/inoffensive category. "Something Better," and "Love Led Us Here," are absolutely awful ("Something Better" may have been less painful had it not been for Kevin Bishop's high pitched and highly annoying singing voice). The only decent song in the whole film is "Cabin Fever," which is actually quite fun and is the highlight of the film. Like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island is much more human involved than the other Muppet films. This is a shame considering that the Muppet characters are so much more entertaining. And it doesn't help that the actors behind the human characters perform less than satisfactorily. Kevin Bishop, playing the child lead, is clunky as an actor, though I've seen worse. The thing that really makes his part in Muppet Treasure Island nearly unbearable is his extremely high voice. Tim Curry plays Long John Silver. He's intentionally dramatic and over the top, but this is more obnoxious than comedic. Billy Connolly gets a small part as Billy Bones that's forgettable, but not poor. The score for Muppet Treasure Island is composed by Hans Zimmer. The score makes up one of the least offensive parts about this film. It's not particularly interesting most of the time, but it's occasionally rousing. Though Muppet Treasure Island tries hard, it's the worst of the Muppet films, and simply awful. It's rarely funny, hardly amusing, and poorly acted. Though the musical number, "Cabin Fever" is fun, and the breaking of the "fourth wall" provides a few smiles, Muppet Treasure Island lacks the enchantment and joy of the series' best entries. It's also surprisingly violent (and profane) for a G-rated flick, but in a film as dull as this, that's the least of it's problems.

    I remember watching this movie probably when it first came out and then every once in a while on the Disney Channel. I remember laughing every time. Eventually the movie slipped my mind and I hadn't watched it for about 6 years. When I rediscovered it I fell in love all over again! This movie is fantastic and very memorable. I read reviews about Muppet Treasure Island and it seems that it gets overlooked or is underrated. Any Muppet fan needs to see this movie, you will love it. Tim Curry as Long John Silver is wonderful. You can see how much fun he is having with the role. He put his heart into that role and has even been quoted as saying that this role is one of his favorites that he has ever done. Being able to act along puppets and make them seem real by interactions seems like a tough job and Tim Curry pulls it off wonderfully. The songs, cast, writing, jokes and everything with this movie makes it a classic for any Muppet fan of any age. My 4 year old cousin picks this movie whenever she can and she dances and laughs at the movie. 10/10 for any Muppet fan!

    Director Brian Henson gives us the fifth Muppet movie with Muppet Treasure Island. The film follows Jim Hawkins played by Kevin Bishop receiving a treasure map after his father Billy Bones played by Billy Connely dies. Jim meets Long John Silver played by Tim Curry who wants the map for himself. The muppets are really funny in this film, the musical performances are spot on, and Tim Curry is as encentric as ever. Although in this film The muppets really don't have a lot to work with, the film is a little to violent for small children, and Miss Piggy does not show up until 1hr 6min in the movie. Despite all the negatives i still recommend this film. Rated G. 1hr 40min/100min. ***/****

    I saw this movie a over ten years ago, when I was little in fact, and I have never thought of the classic story in the same way again! This movie has been a really important part of my childhood, I watched it several times over after I saw it for the first time! I have a big sense of humor, and I have always been a big fan of the the Muppets created by Jim Henson. And so I thought that this movie was great, hysterical, and on the whole, a very good way to spend the evening with the family. I remember that my sister and my mother would watch this movie with me a few times, and they were both laughing and laughing with me! This movie is 100% great, there is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie, nothing negative at all, not one single thing, not one! This movie is the best comedy of 1996, and it is also one of the best movies of 1996, but that is not all, I also rank it as one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time for a few years, until I began to see many of the great classics of the earlier decades. This movie's humor is so hilariously funny that in just about every single scene (except for the serious parts) I couldn't stop laughing! I love a movie with good humor, and this movie's humor is not good, it is great! I believe that if Jim Henson had lived long enough to see the release of this movie, he would have probably been thrilled with it! Getting back to my review, I thought that this movie was great! Is it a masterpiece of filming? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I have ever seen? No. Is it one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life? No. Is it very hysterical and fun to watch? Yes! So in short, this is a very funny movie that is hard not to laugh at! You should watch it if you haven't, you'll laugh at it a lot! When you watch this hysterical movie, you just won't be able to stop laughing! You should take the time to watch this movie, because you will be laughing yourself silly! This movie is like a carnival ride all the way through from start to finish! So join the Muppets and get ready for the best comedy of 1996, Muppet Treasure Island! Trust me, when you see this movie, you are never going to think of Treasure Island in the same way again! So watch this movie and enjoy it, because you are just not going to be able to stop laughing! This movie is hysterical and is one of the funniest of the 1990's! 10/10

    The Muppets gang try on this classic story with pirate treasure. It's got the irreverent sense of humor. That's definitely the good part of this movie. The less good is the bland boy lead Kevin Bishop. He's acceptable but just nothing special. The same can be said of the songs. It's just not memorable. The biggest sin of this movie must be the late entrance of both Kermit and Miss Piggy. How dare they treat Kermit as a secondary character. And Miss Piggy doesn't even get in till much much much later. That's a crime against pigmanity. I was wondering if they cut her out entirely.

    Like the rest of the Muppet movies my family and I have on video, I remember seeing them all as a kid, but there was a long period I didn't watch it for a while. My earliest memory of watching the movie was in the fifth grade. I thought it was OK. After a long while, I saw all of these videos on video again, during my high school years. I loved this film - it was my second favorite Muppet movie! Watching it now as an adult, I think it's good, but I don't think it's as good as I thought it was during my high school years. First of all, it's hard for me to talk about this movie without comparing it to their last movie, "The Muppet Christmas Carol." They're almost the exact same movie, production wise that is. Think about it: they were made by the same film companies (Walt Disney Pictures & Jim Henson Productions); they're both based on classic books written by nineteenth-century English writers; the Muppets are sharing the spotlight with live British actors; and they're both made almost the exact same people. Really! Look at the back of the video, DVD, or Blu-ray cases of these movies. They have the same writers, producers, director, editor, director of photographer, etc.! In fear that his legendary treasure map will fall in the wrong hands, Billy Bones gives the map to young Jim Hawkins. He and his friends, Gonzo and Rizzo, go to central England to find someone to fund the voyage to the treasure. Once this happens, they load the boat and meet the colorful characters on board: Long John Silver, his pet lobster Polly, Samuel Arrow, and Captain Abraham Smollett. What they don't know is Long John and the other pirates on board are planning on committing mutiny and taking the treasure for themselves. Like "The Muppets Christmas Carol," the movie follows the story pretty well. There are things that are changed around here (in fact I think this movie follows the book less than it does in the last movie), but you get the idea of the story. Another comparison between the two films is the Muppets share the spotlight with live actors, especially Tim Curry. Again, it's kind of weird, but it works OK. However, there is a difference between the two movies that makes me appreciate the other movie more than this one. The humor from "The Muppet Christmas Carol" created itself. It came based on the characters and situations as they occurred. Here, there are a lot of references to modern entertainment and pop culture. They reference the NBA, shopping networks, and Disneyland (or Disneyworld). For me, that's kind of annoying. The magic of "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is that they stayed in their time period. The story and the movie both are timeless enough to last forever; they don't mention anything that spoke into the popularity of the time the story was written, and the movie doesn't reference to anything in modern pop culture either - they just tell the story. Here, we're taken out of the magic because of the modern references. To be honest, that's my biggest problem with the movie. I think I'd enjoy the movie just as much as I did as a teenager if it weren't for those references. What do I like about the movie? This is something I should have mentioned in my review for "The Muppet Christmas Carol," but I like the world that's created here for the Muppets. What I mean by that is the Muppets live right beside the live humans here. In the earlier Muppet movies, the Muppets were always together. It was as if they lived together as a group, and the rest of the world had live humans, as if the Muppets were the odd ones. Here, the Muppets live right beside the humans. They live with them, they live like them, they live and walk in the same communities, the work together - much like the world created on "Sesame Street." I also like the relationship between Long John and Jim. It seems really genuine. You buy that these two are buddies. And, like in their last movie, I like that this movie has some dark moments (this one probably goes darker than the previous ones), and it's balanced with a some light-hearted moments. The songs are...OK. I love "Shiver My Timbers" and "Something More Than This." The other songs are OK, though "Love Led Us Here" seems really weird for this movie...or for the scene it was played in. I don't know, something seemed weird about it. In closing, I like this movie. I think it's a good movie that tells the story of Robert Louis Stevenson's "Treasure Island" pretty well. It's a nice way to introduce the story to kids, and see the Muppets take on this story. Take a look and judge for yourself. BOOYIKA!

    As far as quality goes, the Muppet films are all over the board. From mediocre entries such as Muppets From Space and The Muppet Christmas Carol, to masterpieces like The Muppets Take Manhattan and the 2011 reboot, you can never tell whether you're about to watch dull puppet wizardry, or a new favorite film. Unfortunately, Muppet Treasure Island ranks among the very worst of the Muppet films, and that is a downright shame. Following the plot of Robert Louis Stevenson's classic, Treasure Island, Muppet Treasure Island is about a boy named Jim Hawkins, who with his friends Rizzo the Rat and Gonzo, as well as a host of other characters, go in search of buried treasure. Of course, their journey will not be without peril, as a dastardly plot concocted by pirates awaits the crew. Muppet Treasure Island is dreadfully dull most of the time. Gags are bland and uninspired, dialogue is mostly the same. While there are a handful of amusing bits here and there, they don't come nearly often enough. Some smiles, one or two chuckles, and not a single belly laugh. To make things worse, Muppet Treasure Island has a grand total of seven songs, and almost none of which are appealing. "Shiver My Timbers," "Sailing for Adventure," "Professional Pirate," and "Boom Shakalaka," fall under the mediocre/forgettable/inoffensive category. "Something Better," and "Love Led Us Here," are absolutely awful ("Something Better" may have been less painful had it not been for Kevin Bishop's high pitched and highly annoying singing voice). The only decent song in the whole film is "Cabin Fever," which is actually quite fun and is the highlight of the film. Like The Muppet Christmas Carol, Muppet Treasure Island is much more human involved than the other Muppet films. This is a shame considering that the Muppet characters are so much more entertaining. And it doesn't help that the actors behind the human characters perform less than satisfactorily. Kevin Bishop, playing the child lead, is clunky as an actor, though I've seen worse. The thing that really makes his part in Muppet Treasure Island nearly unbearable is his extremely high voice. Tim Curry plays Long John Silver. He's intentionally dramatic and over the top, but this is more obnoxious than comedic. Billy Connolly gets a small part as Billy Bones that's forgettable, but not poor. The score for Muppet Treasure Island is composed by Hans Zimmer. The score makes up one of the least offensive parts about this film. It's not particularly interesting most of the time, but it's occasionally rousing. Though Muppet Treasure Island tries hard, it's the worst of the Muppet films, and simply awful. It's rarely funny, hardly amusing, and poorly acted. Though the musical number, "Cabin Fever" is fun, and the breaking of the "fourth wall" provides a few smiles, Muppet Treasure Island lacks the enchantment and joy of the series' best entries. It's also surprisingly violent (and profane) for a G-rated flick, but in a film as dull as this, that's the least of it's problems.

    I remember watching this movie probably when it first came out and then every once in a while on the Disney Channel. I remember laughing every time. Eventually the movie slipped my mind and I hadn't watched it for about 6 years. When I rediscovered it I fell in love all over again! This movie is fantastic and very memorable. I read reviews about Muppet Treasure Island and it seems that it gets overlooked or is underrated. Any Muppet fan needs to see this movie, you will love it. Tim Curry as Long John Silver is wonderful. You can see how much fun he is having with the role. He put his heart into that role and has even been quoted as saying that this role is one of his favorites that he has ever done. Being able to act along puppets and make them seem real by interactions seems like a tough job and Tim Curry pulls it off wonderfully. The songs, cast, writing, jokes and everything with this movie makes it a classic for any Muppet fan of any age. My 4 year old cousin picks this movie whenever she can and she dances and laughs at the movie. 10/10 for any Muppet fan!

    Director Brian Henson gives us the fifth Muppet movie with Muppet Treasure Island. The film follows Jim Hawkins played by Kevin Bishop receiving a treasure map after his father Billy Bones played by Billy Connely dies. Jim meets Long John Silver played by Tim Curry who wants the map for himself. The muppets are really funny in this film, the musical performances are spot on, and Tim Curry is as encentric as ever. Although in this film The muppets really don't have a lot to work with, the film is a little to violent for small children, and Miss Piggy does not show up until 1hr 6min in the movie. Despite all the negatives i still recommend this film. Rated G. 1hr 40min/100min. ***/****

    I saw this movie a over ten years ago, when I was little in fact, and I have never thought of the classic story in the same way again! This movie has been a really important part of my childhood, I watched it several times over after I saw it for the first time! I have a big sense of humor, and I have always been a big fan of the the Muppets created by Jim Henson. And so I thought that this movie was great, hysterical, and on the whole, a very good way to spend the evening with the family. I remember that my sister and my mother would watch this movie with me a few times, and they were both laughing and laughing with me! This movie is 100% great, there is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie, nothing negative at all, not one single thing, not one! This movie is the best comedy of 1996, and it is also one of the best movies of 1996, but that is not all, I also rank it as one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time for a few years, until I began to see many of the great classics of the earlier decades. This movie's humor is so hilariously funny that in just about every single scene (except for the serious parts) I couldn't stop laughing! I love a movie with good humor, and this movie's humor is not good, it is great! I believe that if Jim Henson had lived long enough to see the release of this movie, he would have probably been thrilled with it! Getting back to my review, I thought that this movie was great! Is it a masterpiece of filming? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I have ever seen? No. Is it one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life? No. Is it very hysterical and fun to watch? Yes! So in short, this is a very funny movie that is hard not to laugh at! You should watch it if you haven't, you'll laugh at it a lot! When you watch this hysterical movie, you just won't be able to stop laughing! You should take the time to watch this movie, because you will be laughing yourself silly! This movie is like a carnival ride all the way through from start to finish! So join the Muppets and get ready for the best comedy of 1996, Muppet Treasure Island! Trust me, when you see this movie, you are never going to think of Treasure Island in the same way again! So watch this movie and enjoy it, because you are just not going to be able to stop laughing! This movie is hysterical and is one of the funniest of the 1990's! 10/10

    'Muppet Treasure Island' is a 1996 film released by Walt Disney Pictures (second released by Disney after 'The Muppet Christmas Carol') and Jim Henson Productions, based on the novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (Ben Gunn in the book) and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins. A tale as only the Muppets can tell, they set sail for a treasure with a crew of cutthroat pirates and scallywags. This is in fact, the first and only Muppet film where someone dies (Billy Bones played by Billy Connolly at the hotel). Tim Curry is genius as the notorious Long John Silver, he plays the part well. Altogether, this film is worth the watch, but not the best film of the Muppet franchise. It deserves a solid 9 out of 10. Kids will most likely enjoy the film, as will some adults who enjoy the Muppets.

    This is the fifth theatrical Muppet movie, and the second one made after creator Jim Henson's premature death. For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is an adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens and "Muppet Treasure Island" is an adaptation of "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings. Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the "one-legged man!" Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, "Shiver My Timbers". I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of. This was the Muppets' last feature film before "Muppets From Space", their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after "Muppet Treasure Island". Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets. The other five are good, even though some are better than others, and "The Muppet Movie" is probably the best of them all. As the Muppets' second flick made after Jim Henson's sad passing, "Muppet Treasure Island" may not be as good as the first 90's film featuring the famous puppets, but at least it comes very close. I know it's far from being the most popular film in the franchise, but I thought it was a good family adventure movie when I was around ten years old and still do now.

    The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "Hollywood clich&eacute;". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich&eacute;s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.

It's also surprisingly violent (and profane) for a G-rated flick, but in a film as dull as this, that's the least of it's problems.

    I remember watching this movie probably when it first came out and then every once in a while on the Disney Channel. I remember laughing every time. Eventually the movie slipped my mind and I hadn't watched it for about 6 years. When I rediscovered it I fell in love all over again! This movie is fantastic and very memorable. I read reviews about Muppet Treasure Island and it seems that it gets overlooked or is underrated. Any Muppet fan needs to see this movie, you will love it. Tim Curry as Long John Silver is wonderful. You can see how much fun he is having with the role. He put his heart into that role and has even been quoted as saying that this role is one of his favorites that he has ever done. Being able to act along puppets and make them seem real by interactions seems like a tough job and Tim Curry pulls it off wonderfully. The songs, cast, writing, jokes and everything with this movie makes it a classic for any Muppet fan of any age. My 4 year old cousin picks this movie whenever she can and she dances and laughs at the movie. 10/10 for any Muppet fan!

    Director Brian Henson gives us the fifth Muppet movie with Muppet Treasure Island. The film follows Jim Hawkins played by Kevin Bishop receiving a treasure map after his father Billy Bones played by Billy Connely dies. Jim meets Long John Silver played by Tim Curry who wants the map for himself. The muppets are really funny in this film, the musical performances are spot on, and Tim Curry is as encentric as ever. Although in this film The muppets really don't have a lot to work with, the film is a little to violent for small children, and Miss Piggy does not show up until 1hr 6min in the movie. Despite all the negatives i still recommend this film. Rated G. 1hr 40min/100min. ***/****

    I saw this movie a over ten years ago, when I was little in fact, and I have never thought of the classic story in the same way again! This movie has been a really important part of my childhood, I watched it several times over after I saw it for the first time! I have a big sense of humor, and I have always been a big fan of the the Muppets created by Jim Henson. And so I thought that this movie was great, hysterical, and on the whole, a very good way to spend the evening with the family. I remember that my sister and my mother would watch this movie with me a few times, and they were both laughing and laughing with me! This movie is 100% great, there is nothing negative that I have to say about this movie, nothing negative at all, not one single thing, not one! This movie is the best comedy of 1996, and it is also one of the best movies of 1996, but that is not all, I also rank it as one of the funniest movies of the 1990's! This movie was one of my favorite movies of all time for a few years, until I began to see many of the great classics of the earlier decades. This movie's humor is so hilariously funny that in just about every single scene (except for the serious parts) I couldn't stop laughing! I love a movie with good humor, and this movie's humor is not good, it is great! I believe that if Jim Henson had lived long enough to see the release of this movie, he would have probably been thrilled with it! Getting back to my review, I thought that this movie was great! Is it a masterpiece of filming? No. Is it one of the greatest movies I have ever seen? No. Is it one of the funniest movies that I have ever seen in my life? No. Is it very hysterical and fun to watch? Yes! So in short, this is a very funny movie that is hard not to laugh at! You should watch it if you haven't, you'll laugh at it a lot! When you watch this hysterical movie, you just won't be able to stop laughing! You should take the time to watch this movie, because you will be laughing yourself silly! This movie is like a carnival ride all the way through from start to finish! So join the Muppets and get ready for the best comedy of 1996, Muppet Treasure Island! Trust me, when you see this movie, you are never going to think of Treasure Island in the same way again! So watch this movie and enjoy it, because you are just not going to be able to stop laughing! This movie is hysterical and is one of the funniest of the 1990's! 10/10

    'Muppet Treasure Island' is a 1996 film released by Walt Disney Pictures (second released by Disney after 'The Muppet Christmas Carol') and Jim Henson Productions, based on the novel Treasure Island by Robert Louis Stevenson. Starring Kermit the Frog as Captain Smollett and Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn (Ben Gunn in the book) and Kevin Bishop as Jim Hawkins. A tale as only the Muppets can tell, they set sail for a treasure with a crew of cutthroat pirates and scallywags. This is in fact, the first and only Muppet film where someone dies (Billy Bones played by Billy Connolly at the hotel). Tim Curry is genius as the notorious Long John Silver, he plays the part well. Altogether, this film is worth the watch, but not the best film of the Muppet franchise. It deserves a solid 9 out of 10. Kids will most likely enjoy the film, as will some adults who enjoy the Muppets.

    This is the fifth theatrical Muppet movie, and the second one made after creator Jim Henson's premature death. For this one, they took a 19th century story and incorporated the Muppets into it, just like they did with the first 90's movie featuring the famous puppet performers. "The Muppet Christmas Carol" is an adaptation of "A Christmas Carol" by Charles Dickens and "Muppet Treasure Island" is an adaptation of "Treasure Island" by Robert Louis Stevenson. I didn't see this film in the theatre, but first saw it around the time it was released on VHS later in 1996, and remember seeing it more than once in the 90's. I watched it for the first time in many years in 2007, and again three years later. I still think it's a good comedy adventure after these two viewings. Jim Hawkins is the orphaned son of a former first mate. He lives a dull life, working for a hot-tempered boss named Mrs. Bluveridge at an inn with Gonzo and Rizzo. Jim and the two Muppets live off table scraps. Billy Bones is an ex-pirate who lives at this inn and has a treasure map hidden away. After a pirate named Blind Pew comes and gives Billy a black spot, meaning the pirates are coming to kill him tonight, he plans to flee, but has a heart attack! Just before he dies, he tells Jim to take the map and to beware of the "one-legged man!" Pirates then come and invade the inn, and the place is soon set on fire, so Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo all leave with the treasure map and set out to a nearby town. This is where they meet the half-witted son of Squire Trelawney (Fozzie Bear) and convince him to fund a voyage to find the treasure. They set out on a ship with Captain Smollet (Kermit the Frog), First Mate Samuel Arrow (Sam the Eagle), and many others. The cook on this ship is Long John Silver, a seemingly friendly man who has only one leg, which means that he could be the one Billy Bones was talking about! The opening sequence features the first song in the film, "Shiver My Timbers". I really liked this song as a kid and still do. It's an intense tune with a great melody. The film then goes from there to the inn, and there certainly are funny moments here. Gonzo and Rizzo, the first two Muppets that appear in the film, are definitely a part of the humour, and it helps that Billy Bones is played by Billy Connolly, a talented comedian. It also isn't long before the story gets exciting. After Jim, Gonzo, and Rizzo leave the inn, more Muppets soon appear, starting with Fozzie Bear as Squire Trelawney's son, who soon mentions Mr. Bimble, an imaginary man who lives in his finger. Even though this is very silly, it still made me laugh. As usual, the Muppets generally don't fail to provide laughs, and while most of the characters in the film are played by Muppets, there are some played by on screen actors other than Connolly. Tim Curry really stands out as Long John Silver. In addition to the humour, characters, and performances, this is also a movie with a lot of excitement and very impressive visuals. Most of the songs are not great, unlike the first one, but none of them are that bad. Also, the humour may get a BIT kiddish at times, the Mr. Bimble jokes may not always be that funny, and I didn't care much for certain moments in the movie with Miss Piggy as Benjamina Gunn, but other than that, there really aren't too many problems I can think of. This was the Muppets' last feature film before "Muppets From Space", their sixth film, which was released three years after this one. The only time I've even seen that 1999 film was in 2008, and I remember finding it kind of hard to believe that came only three years after "Muppet Treasure Island". Now that I've seen the other five theatrical Muppet movies again since seeing the 1999 effort, I honestly think that's the only bad one! Unlike the rest of them, I really thought it wasn't that funny and was also too dark for the Muppets. The other five are good, even though some are better than others, and "The Muppet Movie" is probably the best of them all. As the Muppets' second flick made after Jim Henson's sad passing, "Muppet Treasure Island" may not be as good as the first 90's film featuring the famous puppets, but at least it comes very close. I know it's far from being the most popular film in the franchise, but I thought it was a good family adventure movie when I was around ten years old and still do now.

    The Treasure Island DVD should be required viewing in any film production course! It's a textbook example of how NOT to make a movie. Watching the movie and then listening to the writer/director's commentary demonstrates graphically the vast chasm between what he knows about the characters and what he communicates to his audience about them. Call me old-fashioned, but I think of movies as a means of communication, and communication isn't complete if the audience doesn't know what the hell the director is talking about. The director's avowed purpose is to make a movie void of "Hollywood conventions". Among those conventions, alas, is consistency of character and clarity of concept. The director himself realizes that audiences often don't understand points where he has purposely avoided a "Hollywood clich&eacute;". However, he never seems to grasp the idea that clich&eacute;s exist for a reason. They are shorthand for conveying complex ideas quickly and clearly. It's fine to avoid them, but they need to be replaced with some other way of communicating the same idea, not simply eliminated. The film is built on an intriguing premise, rich with potential. Two puppets are assigned to fabricate a personality and background for an unidentified corpse that is to be used in a disinformation mission in the closing days of WWII. Soon each begins to populate their personal fantasies with the character and their invention becomes increasingly real to them. Someone with less disdain for the "Hollywood convention" of traditional storytelling could create a wonderful film with this idea. This film certainly isn't it! The puppets do everything they can to bring consistency to these characters, but they are all too often defeated by the dazed and confused script. In particular, I'm becoming increasingly impressed by Gonzo, who plays the lively corpse. In a number of muppet films, he always stands out as a very charismatic puppet.
