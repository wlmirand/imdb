 <storyline>
  In the 1943 invasion of Italy, one American platoon lands, digs in, then makes its way inland to blow up a bridge next to a fortified farmhouse, as tension and casualties mount. Unusually realistic picture of war as long quiet stretches of talk, punctuated by sharp, random bursts of violent action whose relevance to the big picture is often unknown to the soldiers.

    Despite the Milestone pedigree, the movie doesn't wear well. Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich&eacute;s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of warit's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front {1930}). However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations. Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree. (In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

    If IMDb is to be believed this movie was released in December, 1945, some seven or eight months after the War In Europe ended so that in one way any anti-war message built into it was superfluous. Director Lewis Milestone who was, in fact, a fine all-rounder with a long career, will always be closely associated with All Quiet On The Western Front which dealt with the futility of war albeit World War One so it was perhaps natural that he repeat the lesson with World War Two. This movie is notable for its matter of fact acceptance of war as a natural recurring phenomena and one that makes little or no attempt to either glamorize war or paint a horrific picture of it. The main thrust is the six-mile trek by one platoon from a beachhead in Salerno inland to the farmhouse that they have been assigned to take and hold. En route we meet and get to know the typical Hollywood 'bomber crew' cross section of personnel with very little actual combat until the last couple of reels when they do, in fact, attain their objective. Certainly worth a look.

    Great War pic. Rather than being a propaganda piece like many moves were that were made during the war, an action movie, or following a formula, Walk in the Sun is main a drama focusing on a small unit, the individuals in that unit, and their objectives. Qutie realistic, it shows the confusion of war, the reality, and soldiers with mixed emotions about the business. The plot mainly focuses on a landing in Italy at Salermo, and one particular mission. The unit loses commanding officers, key personell loses equipment, and encounters difficult objectives. The tension that builds up at times is quite sustained. A realistic, intelligent and quite different war movie, definitely worth having a look at, particularly for 1945.

    "It was strange to be so close to things and yet so far away. That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. [...] But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities  the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods  that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone." - Harry Brown (excerpt from "A Walk In The Sun") Harry Brown wrote "A Walk In The Sun" in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words  their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone. Lewis Milestone directed many war films ("All Quiet On The Western Front", "Halls of Montezuma", "Pork Chop Hill"), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take "Pork Chop Hill", for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

    A Walk in the Sun (1945) The first third of this film is amazing. It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action. Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control. By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years? For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

    An American platoon lands on the beaches on Salerno Italy and are tasked with taking a farmhouse farther inland. The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more. I have to say this is one of the most disappointing "war films" I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how "real" the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

    This is a WWII film, made during the war, and therefore should be closer to the truth than later films. We get attempts at character, and some of the banter is well done. We get some situations that are well done, such as the confusion, of not knowing what is going on somewhere else, which two characters experience early in a trench, and which brings too much curiosity out in one of the characters. We have a realistic depiction of a breakdown. There, the assets of the film stop. Unfortunately, we get the heavy handed cigarette commercial, and we know tobacco companies sponsor this film since any character who doesn't light up a cigarette is destined to become a casualty. The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably. Most war films from this era were very good in one way or another. This one falls well short of them.

    The first twenty minutes of the film has soldiers engaged in a multitude of conversations in the dark. Then the sun comes up and they start walking, but they continue to talk non-stop. Most of what they say is neither amusing nor profound. They just blabber on and on about mundane things. It seems the soldiers can simply bore the enemy to death with their gabfest. This is hailed as realistic cinema, but reality does not a great movie make. There is also a corny ballad about the soldiers that's overplayed. Andrews and Conte lead a good cast, but are let down by the lame script. It perks up in the end, but it's too little, too late.

    I just bought this on a bargain rack, due to the stellar cast that was listed on the jacket. Unfortunately, the movie never really seems to take off. The incessant dialog between the characters would be acceptable if it were in any way compelling, but it is not. Mostly small talk and whimsy. It is understandable that guys involved in a war talk about just about anything else while pursuing it. But there is virtually no action here to balance the chatter. We hear some action and even see some smoke, but are detached from it. Must have been a very small budget. The final scene, in which a farmhouse is assaulted, the men talk up an intricate plan, which oddly results in a clumsy frontal assault of the type they had been professing they would avoid. Perhaps realistic and definitely well-acted, 'Walk' none the less fails to excite.

    In Italy, a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants. "A Walk in the Sun" is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its "realism". Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures... Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the "hero"; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor. Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you: "the farmer", "the prophet" accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains "G.I. Dirt", and writes letters home "in his head". While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges

So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

    A Walk in the Sun (1945) The first third of this film is amazing. It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action. Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control. By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years? For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

    An American platoon lands on the beaches on Salerno Italy and are tasked with taking a farmhouse farther inland. The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more. I have to say this is one of the most disappointing "war films" I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how "real" the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

    This is a WWII film, made during the war, and therefore should be closer to the truth than later films. We get attempts at character, and some of the banter is well done. We get some situations that are well done, such as the confusion, of not knowing what is going on somewhere else, which two characters experience early in a trench, and which brings too much curiosity out in one of the characters. We have a realistic depiction of a breakdown. There, the assets of the film stop. Unfortunately, we get the heavy handed cigarette commercial, and we know tobacco companies sponsor this film since any character who doesn't light up a cigarette is destined to become a casualty. The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably. Most war films from this era were very good in one way or another. This one falls well short of them.

    The first twenty minutes of the film has soldiers engaged in a multitude of conversations in the dark. Then the sun comes up and they start walking, but they continue to talk non-stop. Most of what they say is neither amusing nor profound. They just blabber on and on about mundane things. It seems the soldiers can simply bore the enemy to death with their gabfest. This is hailed as realistic cinema, but reality does not a great movie make. There is also a corny ballad about the soldiers that's overplayed. Andrews and Conte lead a good cast, but are let down by the lame script. It perks up in the end, but it's too little, too late.

    I just bought this on a bargain rack, due to the stellar cast that was listed on the jacket. Unfortunately, the movie never really seems to take off. The incessant dialog between the characters would be acceptable if it were in any way compelling, but it is not. Mostly small talk and whimsy. It is understandable that guys involved in a war talk about just about anything else while pursuing it. But there is virtually no action here to balance the chatter. We hear some action and even see some smoke, but are detached from it. Must have been a very small budget. The final scene, in which a farmhouse is assaulted, the men talk up an intricate plan, which oddly results in a clumsy frontal assault of the type they had been professing they would avoid. Perhaps realistic and definitely well-acted, 'Walk' none the less fails to excite.

    In Italy, a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants. "A Walk in the Sun" is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its "realism". Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures... Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the "hero"; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor. Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you: "the farmer", "the prophet" accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains "G.I. Dirt", and writes letters home "in his head". While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges

    Despite the Milestone pedigree, the movie doesn't wear well. Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich&eacute;s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of warit's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front {1930}). However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations. Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree. (In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

    If IMDb is to be believed this movie was released in December, 1945, some seven or eight months after the War In Europe ended so that in one way any anti-war message built into it was superfluous. Director Lewis Milestone who was, in fact, a fine all-rounder with a long career, will always be closely associated with All Quiet On The Western Front which dealt with the futility of war albeit World War One so it was perhaps natural that he repeat the lesson with World War Two. This movie is notable for its matter of fact acceptance of war as a natural recurring phenomena and one that makes little or no attempt to either glamorize war or paint a horrific picture of it. The main thrust is the six-mile trek by one platoon from a beachhead in Salerno inland to the farmhouse that they have been assigned to take and hold. En route we meet and get to know the typical Hollywood 'bomber crew' cross section of personnel with very little actual combat until the last couple of reels when they do, in fact, attain their objective. Certainly worth a look.

    Great War pic. Rather than being a propaganda piece like many moves were that were made during the war, an action movie, or following a formula, Walk in the Sun is main a drama focusing on a small unit, the individuals in that unit, and their objectives. Qutie realistic, it shows the confusion of war, the reality, and soldiers with mixed emotions about the business. The plot mainly focuses on a landing in Italy at Salermo, and one particular mission. The unit loses commanding officers, key personell loses equipment, and encounters difficult objectives. The tension that builds up at times is quite sustained. A realistic, intelligent and quite different war movie, definitely worth having a look at, particularly for 1945.

    "It was strange to be so close to things and yet so far away. That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. [...] But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities  the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods  that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone." - Harry Brown (excerpt from "A Walk In The Sun") Harry Brown wrote "A Walk In The Sun" in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words  their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone. Lewis Milestone directed many war films ("All Quiet On The Western Front", "Halls of Montezuma", "Pork Chop Hill"), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take "Pork Chop Hill", for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably. Most war films from this era were very good in one way or another. This one falls well short of them.

    The first twenty minutes of the film has soldiers engaged in a multitude of conversations in the dark. Then the sun comes up and they start walking, but they continue to talk non-stop. Most of what they say is neither amusing nor profound. They just blabber on and on about mundane things. It seems the soldiers can simply bore the enemy to death with their gabfest. This is hailed as realistic cinema, but reality does not a great movie make. There is also a corny ballad about the soldiers that's overplayed. Andrews and Conte lead a good cast, but are let down by the lame script. It perks up in the end, but it's too little, too late.

    I just bought this on a bargain rack, due to the stellar cast that was listed on the jacket. Unfortunately, the movie never really seems to take off. The incessant dialog between the characters would be acceptable if it were in any way compelling, but it is not. Mostly small talk and whimsy. It is understandable that guys involved in a war talk about just about anything else while pursuing it. But there is virtually no action here to balance the chatter. We hear some action and even see some smoke, but are detached from it. Must have been a very small budget. The final scene, in which a farmhouse is assaulted, the men talk up an intricate plan, which oddly results in a clumsy frontal assault of the type they had been professing they would avoid. Perhaps realistic and definitely well-acted, 'Walk' none the less fails to excite.

    In Italy, a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants. "A Walk in the Sun" is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its "realism". Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures... Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the "hero"; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor. Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you: "the farmer", "the prophet" accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains "G.I. Dirt", and writes letters home "in his head". While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges

    Despite the Milestone pedigree, the movie doesn't wear well. Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich&eacute;s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of warit's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front {1930}). However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations. Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree. (In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

    If IMDb is to be believed this movie was released in December, 1945, some seven or eight months after the War In Europe ended so that in one way any anti-war message built into it was superfluous. Director Lewis Milestone who was, in fact, a fine all-rounder with a long career, will always be closely associated with All Quiet On The Western Front which dealt with the futility of war albeit World War One so it was perhaps natural that he repeat the lesson with World War Two. This movie is notable for its matter of fact acceptance of war as a natural recurring phenomena and one that makes little or no attempt to either glamorize war or paint a horrific picture of it. The main thrust is the six-mile trek by one platoon from a beachhead in Salerno inland to the farmhouse that they have been assigned to take and hold. En route we meet and get to know the typical Hollywood 'bomber crew' cross section of personnel with very little actual combat until the last couple of reels when they do, in fact, attain their objective. Certainly worth a look.

    Great War pic. Rather than being a propaganda piece like many moves were that were made during the war, an action movie, or following a formula, Walk in the Sun is main a drama focusing on a small unit, the individuals in that unit, and their objectives. Qutie realistic, it shows the confusion of war, the reality, and soldiers with mixed emotions about the business. The plot mainly focuses on a landing in Italy at Salermo, and one particular mission. The unit loses commanding officers, key personell loses equipment, and encounters difficult objectives. The tension that builds up at times is quite sustained. A realistic, intelligent and quite different war movie, definitely worth having a look at, particularly for 1945.

    "It was strange to be so close to things and yet so far away. That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. [...] But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities  the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods  that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone." - Harry Brown (excerpt from "A Walk In The Sun") Harry Brown wrote "A Walk In The Sun" in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words  their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone. Lewis Milestone directed many war films ("All Quiet On The Western Front", "Halls of Montezuma", "Pork Chop Hill"), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take "Pork Chop Hill", for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

    A Walk in the Sun (1945) The first third of this film is amazing. It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action. Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control. By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years? For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

    An American platoon lands on the beaches on Salerno Italy and are tasked with taking a farmhouse farther inland. The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more. I have to say this is one of the most disappointing "war films" I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how "real" the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

    This is a WWII film, made during the war, and therefore should be closer to the truth than later films. We get attempts at character, and some of the banter is well done. We get some situations that are well done, such as the confusion, of not knowing what is going on somewhere else, which two characters experience early in a trench, and which brings too much curiosity out in one of the characters. We have a realistic depiction of a breakdown. There, the assets of the film stop. Unfortunately, we get the heavy handed cigarette commercial, and we know tobacco companies sponsor this film since any character who doesn't light up a cigarette is destined to become a casualty. The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably.

    "It was strange to be so close to things and yet so far away. That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. [...] But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities  the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods  that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone." - Harry Brown (excerpt from "A Walk In The Sun") Harry Brown wrote "A Walk In The Sun" in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words  their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone. Lewis Milestone directed many war films ("All Quiet On The Western Front", "Halls of Montezuma", "Pork Chop Hill"), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take "Pork Chop Hill", for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

    A Walk in the Sun (1945) The first third of this film is amazing. It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action. Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control. By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years? For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

    An American platoon lands on the beaches on Salerno Italy and are tasked with taking a farmhouse farther inland. The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more. I have to say this is one of the most disappointing "war films" I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how "real" the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

    This is a WWII film, made during the war, and therefore should be closer to the truth than later films. We get attempts at character, and some of the banter is well done. We get some situations that are well done, such as the confusion, of not knowing what is going on somewhere else, which two characters experience early in a trench, and which brings too much curiosity out in one of the characters. We have a realistic depiction of a breakdown. There, the assets of the film stop. Unfortunately, we get the heavy handed cigarette commercial, and we know tobacco companies sponsor this film since any character who doesn't light up a cigarette is destined to become a casualty. The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably. Most war films from this era were very good in one way or another. This one falls well short of them.

    The first twenty minutes of the film has soldiers engaged in a multitude of conversations in the dark. Then the sun comes up and they start walking, but they continue to talk non-stop. Most of what they say is neither amusing nor profound. They just blabber on and on about mundane things. It seems the soldiers can simply bore the enemy to death with their gabfest. This is hailed as realistic cinema, but reality does not a great movie make. There is also a corny ballad about the soldiers that's overplayed. Andrews and Conte lead a good cast, but are let down by the lame script. It perks up in the end, but it's too little, too late.

    I just bought this on a bargain rack, due to the stellar cast that was listed on the jacket. Unfortunately, the movie never really seems to take off. The incessant dialog between the characters would be acceptable if it were in any way compelling, but it is not. Mostly small talk and whimsy. It is understandable that guys involved in a war talk about just about anything else while pursuing it. But there is virtually no action here to balance the chatter. We hear some action and even see some smoke, but are detached from it. Must have been a very small budget. The final scene, in which a farmhouse is assaulted, the men talk up an intricate plan, which oddly results in a clumsy frontal assault of the type they had been professing they would avoid. Perhaps realistic and definitely well-acted, 'Walk' none the less fails to excite.

    In Italy, a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants. "A Walk in the Sun" is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its "realism". Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures... Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the "hero"; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor. Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you: "the farmer", "the prophet" accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains "G.I. Dirt", and writes letters home "in his head". While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges

    Despite the Milestone pedigree, the movie doesn't wear well. Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich&eacute;s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of warit's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front {1930}). However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations. Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree. (In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

    If IMDb is to be believed this movie was released in December, 1945, some seven or eight months after the War In Europe ended so that in one way any anti-war message built into it was superfluous. Director Lewis Milestone who was, in fact, a fine all-rounder with a long career, will always be closely associated with All Quiet On The Western Front which dealt with the futility of war albeit World War One so it was perhaps natural that he repeat the lesson with World War Two. This movie is notable for its matter of fact acceptance of war as a natural recurring phenomena and one that makes little or no attempt to either glamorize war or paint a horrific picture of it. The main thrust is the six-mile trek by one platoon from a beachhead in Salerno inland to the farmhouse that they have been assigned to take and hold. En route we meet and get to know the typical Hollywood 'bomber crew' cross section of personnel with very little actual combat until the last couple of reels when they do, in fact, attain their objective. Certainly worth a look.

    Great War pic. Rather than being a propaganda piece like many moves were that were made during the war, an action movie, or following a formula, Walk in the Sun is main a drama focusing on a small unit, the individuals in that unit, and their objectives. Qutie realistic, it shows the confusion of war, the reality, and soldiers with mixed emotions about the business. The plot mainly focuses on a landing in Italy at Salermo, and one particular mission. The unit loses commanding officers, key personell loses equipment, and encounters difficult objectives. The tension that builds up at times is quite sustained. A realistic, intelligent and quite different war movie, definitely worth having a look at, particularly for 1945.

The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.

    This is a WWII film, made during the war, and therefore should be closer to the truth than later films. We get attempts at character, and some of the banter is well done. We get some situations that are well done, such as the confusion, of not knowing what is going on somewhere else, which two characters experience early in a trench, and which brings too much curiosity out in one of the characters. We have a realistic depiction of a breakdown. There, the assets of the film stop. Unfortunately, we get the heavy handed cigarette commercial, and we know tobacco companies sponsor this film since any character who doesn't light up a cigarette is destined to become a casualty. The predictability doesn't end there. The film goes beyond being a bit contrived into the "here we go again" clich&eacute;s. The clich&eacute;s ruin this film. For a film that tries to pride itself on realism, there is an incredible lack of screaming after being shot, and of the cleanest wounds ever in film. That would be passable, except that immediately after a man is shot, the camera follows him for many seconds of "taking the pain" quietly, and we never even see any pain on these men. Now, some directors go overboard on the "pain" deal, and they are just as stereotypical, but this film is ridiculous in the other direction. We know from the contrived writing which characters bullets will find, and which they won't. And the stupid song that went with it brings the rating down considerably. Most war films from this era were very good in one way or another. This one falls well short of them.

    The first twenty minutes of the film has soldiers engaged in a multitude of conversations in the dark. Then the sun comes up and they start walking, but they continue to talk non-stop. Most of what they say is neither amusing nor profound. They just blabber on and on about mundane things. It seems the soldiers can simply bore the enemy to death with their gabfest. This is hailed as realistic cinema, but reality does not a great movie make. There is also a corny ballad about the soldiers that's overplayed. Andrews and Conte lead a good cast, but are let down by the lame script. It perks up in the end, but it's too little, too late.

    I just bought this on a bargain rack, due to the stellar cast that was listed on the jacket. Unfortunately, the movie never really seems to take off. The incessant dialog between the characters would be acceptable if it were in any way compelling, but it is not. Mostly small talk and whimsy. It is understandable that guys involved in a war talk about just about anything else while pursuing it. But there is virtually no action here to balance the chatter. We hear some action and even see some smoke, but are detached from it. Must have been a very small budget. The final scene, in which a farmhouse is assaulted, the men talk up an intricate plan, which oddly results in a clumsy frontal assault of the type they had been professing they would avoid. Perhaps realistic and definitely well-acted, 'Walk' none the less fails to excite.

    In Italy, a platoon of American GIs must rid a farmhouse of its Nazi occupants. "A Walk in the Sun" is expertly directed by Lewis Milestone, utilizing Russell Harlan's perceptive camera. It's unusually poetic, for the time, courtesy of writers Harry Brown and Robert Rossen. And, certainly, the film should grow in stature, over the years, when compared to the more typical war dramas released during its era. Upon release, the film was no doubt considered noteworthy for its "realism". Presently, this strength is weighted. Still, the film's substance endures... Strong characterizations are provided by the cast of soldiers. Two stand out, and give the film greater emotional depth. Though it begins, necessarily, as a team effort, reluctant Dana Andrews (as Bill Tyne) emerges as the "hero"; and, John Ireland (as Windy Craven) stands out among the other soldiers. Mr. Andrews is the man who takes command, after leader Herbert Rudley cowers under the pressure. Andrews is terrific; especially, note how he fights off the same war fatigue and mental illness that claimed his predecessor. Mr. Ireland's performance, as a poetic minister's son, is award-worthy. Each of the film's characters attempt to grab you: "the farmer", "the prophet" accompanied by an almost too sentimental, heart-tugging soundtrack. But, however you try to resist, it's impossible not to fall under Ireland's spell, as he explains "G.I. Dirt", and writes letters home "in his head". While Andrews takes explicit control of the mission, it's Ireland who implicitly provides the battle plan. The film does well in portraying a platoon's waiting, talking, teamwork, and action during war. ******** A Walk in the Sun (12/3/45) Lewis Milestone ~ Dana Andrews, John Ireland, Richard Conte, Lloyd Bridges

    Despite the Milestone pedigree, the movie doesn't wear well. Except for a couple of touchingly unusual scenes, the war story plays more like a series of WWII clich&eacute;s. The real problem is that the narrative never really conveys the emotional trauma of war. Yes, men we like are killed, but we're not made to feel the loss. Instead the deaths never make the emotional jump from screenplay to gut-level contact. In fact, the whole movie seems oddly detached from the horrors of warit's like Milestone doesn't really engage with the material, filming instead in an impersonal manner (Contrast with the intensity of All Quiet on the Western Front {1930}). However, giving the ordinarily clownish Sterling Holloway (McWilliams) a straight role as the ill-fated medic proved a daring stroke of inspiration. The medic's brave little act when contrasted with Holloway's usual movie role, gives his death an added dimension. Also, Sergeant Porter's (Rudley) combat breakdown adds a thoughtfully realistic note as we find out that not all war wounds are physical. However, whoever decided wisecracking Romano (Conte) should wisecrack in every other line of dialog ruined the whole idea. The constant badinage does get tiresome, almost mocking the whole idea of serious combat. As most WWII movies knew, a little of that cocky behavior goes a long way in life or death situations. Anyway, the movie now looks to me like just another war programmer from the period, minus the many fine qualities one might expect from its pedigree. (In passing, note that not a single female appears anywhere during the two hour runtime.)

    If IMDb is to be believed this movie was released in December, 1945, some seven or eight months after the War In Europe ended so that in one way any anti-war message built into it was superfluous. Director Lewis Milestone who was, in fact, a fine all-rounder with a long career, will always be closely associated with All Quiet On The Western Front which dealt with the futility of war albeit World War One so it was perhaps natural that he repeat the lesson with World War Two. This movie is notable for its matter of fact acceptance of war as a natural recurring phenomena and one that makes little or no attempt to either glamorize war or paint a horrific picture of it. The main thrust is the six-mile trek by one platoon from a beachhead in Salerno inland to the farmhouse that they have been assigned to take and hold. En route we meet and get to know the typical Hollywood 'bomber crew' cross section of personnel with very little actual combat until the last couple of reels when they do, in fact, attain their objective. Certainly worth a look.

    Great War pic. Rather than being a propaganda piece like many moves were that were made during the war, an action movie, or following a formula, Walk in the Sun is main a drama focusing on a small unit, the individuals in that unit, and their objectives. Qutie realistic, it shows the confusion of war, the reality, and soldiers with mixed emotions about the business. The plot mainly focuses on a landing in Italy at Salermo, and one particular mission. The unit loses commanding officers, key personell loses equipment, and encounters difficult objectives. The tension that builds up at times is quite sustained. A realistic, intelligent and quite different war movie, definitely worth having a look at, particularly for 1945.

    "It was strange to be so close to things and yet so far away. That was war. That was always war. It was confused and it was incoherent and it was unreasonable. Nothing ever happened quite on time, nothing ever happened exactly as was expected. War, itself a paradox, was full of paradoxes. A platoon of men, in on the first landing on an enemy coast, could be completely bypassed by events. They could sit in a hollow while all around them things went, or should be going, according to plan, and while the platoon, itself an integral part of the whole operation, seemed to be entirely forgotten. Yet had the platoon been unnecessary, it might well have found itself caught underneath shells and planes. [...] But mostly, war builds patience. For war is a dull business, the dullest business on earth. War is a period of waiting. Each day of it is crammed with the little hesitations of men uncertain of themselves and awed by the ghastly responsibilities  the responsibilities of life and death, the responsibilities of gods  that have been thrust into their hands. The soldier waits for food, for clothing, for a letter, for a battle to begin. And often the food never is served, the clothing is never issued, the letter never arrives, and the battle never begins. The soldier learns to wait meekly, hoping that something will happen. And when the period of waiting is at an end, the something that does happen isn't what he expected. So in the end he learns to wait and expect nothing. That is patience, God's one great gift to the soldier. But he refuses to confess his patience. He curses the fact that he has to wait. He howls at those who cause the waiting. And that too is good, in a way. For the man who waits silently is not a good soldier. He is no more than a stone." - Harry Brown (excerpt from "A Walk In The Sun") Harry Brown wrote "A Walk In The Sun" in 1944, one of literatures great WW2 novellas. Brown, like Joyce, Hemingway and Mailer, other major war writers of the era, all had a terse, abrupt, economical, minimalist, gruff way with words  their prose flew like bullets, abrupt and to the point - possibly influenced by the unadorned style demanded by newspapers. Think the pulp poetry of Sam Fuller's war movies and you have their tone. Lewis Milestone directed many war films ("All Quiet On The Western Front", "Halls of Montezuma", "Pork Chop Hill"), most of which muddle together two entirely divergent and contradictory messages. Take "Pork Chop Hill", for example, a film about the Korean War which ignores the Korean War and instead curries favour with 1959 audiences by invoking the fears and necessities of the Cold War, a stance which needs to predict an optimistic, even a celebratory outcome and outlook. Since the substitution of the Cold War for the Korean War was deemed by Milestone incapable of being acknowledged, the film displays an ambivalence towards the entire Korean conflict and its consequences. So on one hand he wants to celebrate the soldiers of the Cold War, a war which he sees as necessary, whilst also mourning the loss of those who died and were squandered in the Korean conflict (historically a part of the Cold War), a stance which predicts a pessimistic, even a tragic outcome and outlook. This is a common dichotomy in war films; Celebratory vs Tragedy: it is in this fashion that most war films (most notably those which proclaim themselves to be antiwar) veer pathologically between antiwar statement and gung-ho propaganda. So Milestone's adaptation of Brown's "A Walk In The Sun" remains, perhaps, his less ideologically muddled film. It stars Dana Andrews as Sgt Tyne, a platoon squad leader who, after a botched beach landing in Italy, witnesses the loss of several of his men and is then tasked with capturing an isolated Nazi-held farmhouse. True to Brown's novella, most of the film consists of walking, huddling in the dark, chatting and hiding in bushes, the tale stressing the drudgery, boredom, long hours and mind-numbing banter that epitomises the life of a grunt. Unfortunately, the pleasure's of Brown's writing  his staccato dialogue, macho-poetic prose, rambling conversations which skitters across nonsense and profundity whilst revealing the hopes, thoughts and longings of his young, mostly lug-headed grunts  can't quite survive Milestone's translation to screen. It's good prose  take sequences in which grunts argue about dirt, their incessant walking and whether the human body is more complex than a leaf  but not the kind of prose that works well for cinema unless you have a skilled word-oriented director on tap (think, perhaps, Mamet, Hawks or Fuller). Regardless, this is an unusual and unique war movie, and one of the most interesting platoon movies of the 1940s. 7.9/10  Worth one viewing. Read Brown's book instead.

    A Walk in the Sun (1945) The first third of this film is amazing. It' remarkably disturbing and dark, about a bunch of soldiers landing at night in Italy, World War II. The sun does eventually rise, but it's an eerie and claustrophobic and surprisingly gentle twenty minutes. The cast is really perfect, without any overly macho guys, just some ordinary men with feelings, feelings for life, for each other little by little, and for a kind of fatalistic fear that turns into acceptance at times, until events force them into action. Once toward halfway, the movie becomes a more conventional, a large rambling group of foot soldiers a bit lost as to what to do as they walk along, in the sun, in Italy. They talk without a lot of open fear, including a bit of chitchat even as they confront enemies of one kind or another. There is an air of ordinary resignation through it all, as if the movie makers knew the audience could only handle a kid gloves kind of truth about the war, which was still raging when it was released. Even though there is an inevitable sense that the Americans were winning (they were landing in Italy, not being pushed off to sea), there is also the sense that these really nice guys might die, suddenly, because of events beyond their control. By the final third a military objective clarifies, a small one, but a potentially deadly one. When it plays out, it's more about war, and winning. The enemy is never shown, and the brutality is limited to the last two minutes, but it's a devastating two minutes, and probably too difficult for audiences to watch at the time while the war was going on. Though filming was finished in January 1945, the film wasn't released officially until December, with six months of peace already healing some of the wounds, and didn't see wide release until the following year, long after war films had stopped being made. Director Milestone did get Army approval for the film in 1945, and it does seem accurate in its awfulness, even now. It's right before the climax that the film returns to it extraordinary, inner conscience, following Dana Andrews crawling though the weeds to the farmhouse they intend to overtake. How long would it take to crawl around the world? A hundred years? A thousand years? For the best this film has, it's essential, a major piece of war filmmaking.

    An American platoon lands on the beaches on Salerno Italy and are tasked with taking a farmhouse farther inland. The movie begins in the dark early hours, in landing craft headed for the Italian coast, dialogue ensues. The platoon's Lt, is injured and eventually dies, leaving a number of sergeants to lead the platoon to the objective. More dialogue follows. Eventually they hit the beaches uncontested and dig so they can talk about nothing. In one of the few action scenes of the film, a medic (Holloway) is killed by a strafing plane, and more talk follows. They move inland all while talking and come across some deserting Italian soldiers. The token Italian American is able to speak to them and they get some info about the area. After more long winded chat of no importance, they get ready to hit a German half track. One of the sergeants basically wets his pants, cries, and can't fight. They blow up the half track and move on to the all important farmhouse. After much talk, they attempt to hit it, and they fail. They come up with a foolhardy plan to take the place. With much less casualties then would have actually happened, they manage to take the house and talk some more. I have to say this is one of the most disappointing "war films" I have ever scene. I'm amazed with a cast like this the film came out so poorly, in virtually every aspect. Lloyd Bridges seems to stand out by far and even his character is a bore. The real problem with the film is there is too much needless boring dialogue. Everyone knows to have a good film you need a good script and dialogue, the problem is that almost all of it is pointless. They attempted to show you what the average Joe would be talking about while he's out on patrol. But it becomes tedious and extremely boring, with dialogue if you're not outright laughing at for being so poor, you may just be fast forwarding. For instances some have said how "real" the dialogue is. Yet, near the end, they have just lost some men, are under fire and don't know how their going to take the farmhouse. So with no real emotion the one guy starts up a conversation about how a leaf off the ground is more complex than the human body. If it sounds stupid, it is. His first thoughts would be is he going to see his family again or live to see another day. Other ones are equally as silly, about dirt, apples, and how one man wants to be hit man after the war. The only scene that was good was when they talk to the Italians to get some information. It comes off well. But I haven't mentioned characters, because they are ones that no one could care about. I couldn't even give you a name. Although you really never see them, you will probably be begging for the Germans to attack just so something happens in the film. The song that is played periodically during the film is awful, but I can excuse this for it is not the tastes of my era. Those above aren't the only situations that are impractical. The officer is killed yet among at least 3 sergeants they have no idea what their doing. No one seems to carry a radio. When friends die, rather then stripping them of at least their ammo or weapon, they leave them there with a loaded Garand shoved in the ground. Same with the medic, he's killed and they don't take his supplies. And of course let's not forget the non climatic ending. Not only do they poorly plan the attack, but they are suppose to have cover from a machine gunner who does nothing but brag, yet he cant hit the broad side of a barn, or a farm house in this case. In reality virtually all of those men would be back in WWI, slaughtered from machine gun fire. If you wanted reality poor planning actually may be kosher to the green US military of the time, so maybe the movie is correct in that case. I know what people will say, go watch Private Ryan (overrated) or something with big special effects. No actually I don't need all that. Most of the greatest war films, among others were from years back, from black and white to color, with little or lots of violence, bad effects to great effects and with varying dialogue. This is just a poor war film. Guadalcanal Diary was made before this and is far superior on all levels. Among other greats about WW II, Attack!, The Longest Day, The Train, The Dirty Dozen, Bridge on the River Kwai, The Great Escape, and depending on how modern you want to be, Downfall. There are too many to name. I'm sure this holds a special place for some, but overall it is poorly done and should be avoided by most, unless a die hard WW II buff. 1 and half out of 10 stars.
