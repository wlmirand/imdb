 <sinopse>
  Zookeepers struggle to deal with the policies of changing directors.
 </sinopse>
 <storyline>
  A massive corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc., run by a shrewd and cruel tycoon named Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and also the failing London Marwood Zoo. To bring more business to the zoo, Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits-do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Fierce Creatures Policy shocks the Marwood zookeepers, led by the unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, Rod McCain's son Vince, along with the up-and-coming business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Fierce Creatures Policy. Vince instead comes up with many under-handed and vicious schemes to attract customers-unauthorized celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals instead of real ones. However, Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course....

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered. Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    A Pythonesque Poke at Big Business

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

    Corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc, run by shrewd tycoon Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and the failing London Marwood Zoo. Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits, do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Policy shocks zookeepers, led by unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, McCain's son Vince, along with business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Policy. Vince instead comes up with many schemes to attract customers-unauthorised celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals. Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered. Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least.

A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

    Corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc, run by shrewd tycoon Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and the failing London Marwood Zoo. Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits, do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Policy shocks zookeepers, led by unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, McCain's son Vince, along with business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Policy. Vince instead comes up with many schemes to attract customers-unauthorised celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals. Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered. Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

    Corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc, run by shrewd tycoon Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and the failing London Marwood Zoo. Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits, do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Policy shocks zookeepers, led by unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, McCain's son Vince, along with business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Policy. Vince instead comes up with many schemes to attract customers-unauthorised celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals. Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered.

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

    Corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc, run by shrewd tycoon Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and the failing London Marwood Zoo. Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits, do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Policy shocks zookeepers, led by unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, McCain's son Vince, along with business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Policy. Vince instead comes up with many schemes to attract customers-unauthorised celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals. Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered. Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

    Corporate conglomerate, Octopus Inc, run by shrewd tycoon Rod McCain, purchases a UK-based leisure company, and the failing London Marwood Zoo. Octopus hires a new manager, Rollo Lee, who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits, do away with all the animals except for the ferocious ones. This new Policy shocks zookeepers, led by unendingly talkative Adrian "Bugsy" Malone. Eventually, McCain's son Vince, along with business executive Willa Weston, take control of the zoo and revoke the Policy. Vince instead comes up with many schemes to attract customers-unauthorised celebrity endorsements, shoddy, overpriced zoo merchandise, and using robotic animals. Vince is also stealing from the zoo's funds, and when his father finds out, he rears to turn the zoo into a Japanese-owned golf course. But Willa has grown to love the zoo, and, along with her newly-reformed love interest Rollo, plot with the zookeepers to save the zoo from the McCains... The say lightning never strikes twice, and even though this movie has some very funny moments, it isn't a patch on A Fish Called Wanda. And the trouble is that the majority of the cast literally look like they are trying too hard. Kline is annoying in this (in both roles) and Cleese just looks a little bewildered. Palin is good, but again, over hamming it, and Curtis has the look on her as if to say, i'm the most famous one here. So thank heavens for the rest of the cast, they are truly hilarious and bring the film to life. If the film had been a little more scathing in it's humour, rather than cuddly, then it could have been a winner. it appears that it's trying to be too safe for it's own good, as if it wanted to appeal to a wider audience. Instead, it starts, charms a little with it's innuendo, and then goes, like a sweet great aunt.

    this film is an underestimated masterpiece in the British comedy film file...cleese, Curtis,palin and Kline lead a British cast of legends....including the wonderful Carey Lowell(bond girl) and most of the cast from Wanda all making returns. Set in a zoo that needs to make money brings on lots of set pieces that could be so easily lengthened..but they are tight and funny. Ronnie Corbett, Robert Lindsay and Derek Griffith's lead the Brits with their usual aplomb and this works seamlessly with a bunch of people really enjoying their job and this shows. it didn't get the acclaim that Wanda got...that is a shame... because its a different movie and i think the critics were expecting a sequel of Wanda...what they get is something even more original, even funnier and in keeping with British farce with a plot...we get good comedy, beautiful ladies and brilliant performances from the animals... one of the funniest scenes is the hotel spider set always makes me laugh. If u ever need to introduce a fierce creatures policy - watch this film on NOT how to do it.....its an education

    A Reunion Of The "Wanda" Cast In A Fun Movie With A Weak Story

    The problem that "Fierce Creatures" has to overcome - and, to be perfectly honest, the problem that it doesn't and probably couldn't overcome - is the inevitable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda." I thought "Wanda" was gut-wrenchingly funny; one of my favourite comedies ever. "Fierce Creatures" reunites basically the entire starring cast from that movie (John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Michael Palin and Kevin Kline) but gives them a totally unrelated and original story to work with (although the very last scene of the movie does pay homage to the earlier movie, as Cleese's character inadvertently calls Curtis's "Wanda.") So this isn't a sequel in any way, shape or form. It's just the cast reunited in a different project. But if you've ever seen "A Fish Called Wanda" you're going to be painfully aware that this isn't as good. In this, Curtis is actually playing Willa Weston, an employee of a media mogul who's just bought a zoo in England and - unknown to Willa, who's sent to take charge of it - is planning to close it. Cleese played Rollo Lee, who had been in charge of the zoo and had planned to maximize profits (and thus hopefully save the zoo) by getting rid of all the gentle, timid animals and keeping only the frighteningly fierce creatures, believing that those animals are the only ones people come to see. (Cleese is perhaps the only one of the stars who I thought was as good and as much fun as in "Wanda.") Kline played both the mogul and his son Vince, sent with Willa, and in love with her (and equally convinced that she's in love with him) while Palin played one of the zookeepers, with a particular soft spot for tarantulas. It is, in fact, nowhere near as good as "A Fish Called Wanda." What I liked about it, though, was that it did make me laugh out loud several times - and many so-called comedies don't do that, and don't even come close to doing that. Some of the content is actually quite funny, especially some of the misunderstandings about Rollo's sexual activities that arise from people hearing only parts of conversations and not understanding what's actually happening. It's not really original, but it is funny enough. What doesn't work, though, is the story. There isn't enough to hold a movie together. This basic plot would have perhaps made for a great half hour TV sitcom episode. Trying to stretch it out over an hour and a half (and thankfully no longer than that) was overkill to say the least. To me at least, the story had no real cohesion. It's also exceptionally confusing at times. The beginning of the movie, for example, seems to set Rollo up as the bad guy, but then there's a sudden shift as Rollo turns out to be a softie, and Vince and his dad become the real nasty characters. The shift in the Rollo character was a bit too sudden for my liking, and Kline's Vince was too over the top in a way that wasn't really either funny or likable. I still liked this and had fun with it and laughed at it. But the weak story takes its toll, and the unavoidable comparison to "A Fish Called Wanda" makes this one suffer. (7/10)

    Any one of the comic scenarios the film-makers bring up would be worth exploring to the end. The fact that they cannot seem to keep one satirical conceit going for any stretch, and feel the need to overhaul the plot in a new direction every twenty minutes or so, definitely lessens the impact the movie could have had. And yet, for example: just because the writers beg off early on the "fierce creatures" idea doesn't make it any less hilarious - both as a concept and in execution. The scenes of the kindly zookeepers trying to sell their individual cute little animals as dangerous is one of the funniest scenes in the movie. But then, later, when that concept has been forgotten, and we instead see Kevin Kline leading around a group of potential financial backers, giving them his notions of how corporate sponsorship could work at the zoo . . . well, that's one of the funniest scenes too. What I'm saying is, though a strong focus is something the film lacks, it makes up for it by filling its running time with enough entertaining and well devised comic moments to make you feel like you got your money's worth. The performances help. As in Fish Called Wanda, Jamie Lee Curtis is not particularly noteworthy as an actress OR a comedienne, but she gets by on her general sultriness and willingness to play cheerfully along. Most importantly, she keeps out of the way of the big boys and lets them do their stuff. As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    A Pythonesque Poke at Big Business

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.

    If you like "A Fish Called Wanda," you'll probably get a kick out of this farce, in which an Australian magnate sends two Americans to a British zoo to make it turn a profit. The bad guys are Kevin Kline, Jamie Lee Curtis, and John Cleese, at least until Curtis and Cleese fall for each other. Cleese intends to make money from the zoo by offing all the cuddly little animals and replacing them with "fierce creatures." The tree huggers who run the zoo and love all the animals try to convince the dim-witted Cleese that the cuddly things are in actuality deadly when provoke, telling him tales of people who have torn to shreds by an angry lemur and other nonsense. Cleese is persuaded not to kill the animals but he advertises them all as Dangerous to Man and, to boost profits, drags in merchandising in various forms. A fully grown Bengal tiger wears a kind of table cloth advertising Absolute Vodka with the logo Absolute -- FIERCE. A brand new panda is installed but it's a robot and all it can do is slowly raise and lower its head. Other absurdities abound, some funnier than others. Curtis, wearing a very low-cut dress and a smile, bends down to pet a coati mundi or something and the distracted Cleese mutters, "Yes, that's one of our breast mammaries -- er, best mammals." The whole set-up is in a way a distraction. Everything seems to rush by. People fall down. It's a little exhausting and lacks some of the earnest wit of "A Fish Called Wanda." There is no line here that's the equivalent of, "The philosophy of Buddhism is not 'every man for himself.'" Still, it has some laugh-out-loud moments, at least for me. I think the one I enjoyed most appears near the end. Kevin Kline has been playing the grasping and nasty Australian billionaire with a farcical Australian accent, and also playing the billionaire's son. The elderly billionaire shows up at the zoo, discovers the fraud and confronts his son, whom he holds responsible. Says the ruthless magnate, "The last words you'll hear from me is --" A shot rings out from off screen and a bullet hole appears in the Australian's forehead. Without any change in his expression and after only the slightest pause, he continues, "you're fiiirrred." But his voice has slowed down and become baritone, like a tape recorder with dying batteries. Holding the same angry posture he slowly flops backwards to the grass, a mannequin, evoking images of Saddam Hussein's statue in Baghdad.

As I mentioned, Cleese is a little moldier here than usual, but there's still no one who does high-strung fussiness better, and he holds down the screen nicely. As with Wanda, though, it's Kevin Kline who really steals the show - this time in a dual role, as the Murdoch-like head of the conglomerate and his stupid slimeball son who has big plans for the zoo (as well as getting into Curtis's pants). The sheer *energy* he throws out is infectious, and his ability to "play off" himself - in the scenes between father and son - is nothing short of superb. Blessedly, the dual role bit is revealed as more than just an actor's stunt by the way the movie is resolved: had Kline not been playing both roles, the movie could never end the way it does. That, too, was a nice touch. Genial, breezy, good spirted - this is Fierce Creatures. Nothing in the masterpiece league but, especially if you've seen A Fish Called Wanda, it's a nice evening spent with old friends - with some new and well devised jokes thrown into the mix.

    If Fierce Creatures does not make you appreciate the number of people who volunteer to care for the exotic animals in today's zoos who were never asked if they wanted to leave their habitat to be on exhibit than I don't know what will. Even worse the thought of privatizing zoos to someone who is a philistine like the father that Kevin Kline plays. Kline plays the Rupert Murdoch like father who heads an international conglomerate and he also plays his wastrel and oafish son as well. Father Kline introduces what he thinks is a new policy, the zoo will only exhibit the most dangerous and Fierce Creatures to give the public thrills and chills. Obviously this lugnut has never heard of petting zoos. He sends new director John Cleese and Jamie Lee Curtis to run the place. Soon though they are on the side of the staff, but still have to make the zoo be a money maker to satisfy the boss. A lot of the humor in Fierce Creatures involves the various crazy marketing techniques designed. Since along with Cleese a whole lot of the Monty Python alumni are in this film you know it is going to be zany. Lots of Monty Pythonesque type humor in Fierce Creatures and that's always good.

    My first impression of this movie is that it is very Monty Python. This is not surprising considering that John Cleese wrote it. The film comprises of the actors from A Fish Called Wanda, but unlike the previous movie, the comedy in Fierce Creatures is much more Pythonisque. The most Pythonish part of this movie is the first part where the zookeepers are trying to convince Cleese that these cute, cuddly, animals are actually vicious creatures. An executive, Willa, quits her job to go and work for the most powerful businessman in the world. The problem is, is that the company that she was going to oversee he had already sold, so she decides to take up the offer of running a zoo. The bosses son, who likes Willa and wants to sleep with her, goes over to England with her to help run the zoo. The rules are that the zoo must make a 20% profit margin or it is deemed too useless and is torn down. This is a problem because there are a lot of animals in the zoo that will be killed with it. But the tycoon doesn't care, he just wants his money. Fierce Creatures is a poke at big business and the way that it sacrifices that which makes life interesting for money. The boss is willing to kill all of the animals in the zoo, and in fact didn't fire Cleese because he thought he did kill some of the animals. It also has a go at Rupert Murdoch because the Tycoon is a New Zealander and has a very bad Australian accent. In fact, the minute the boss enters the movie you immediately know that he is an Australian, though the claim to be a New Zealander really bad because New Zealander accents are nothing like Australian accents (well, okay, they are, but listen really closely when they say six). It is also cute the way Cleese is set up in a way that he seems to sleep with multiple women. One can see a set up happening, and it is always done in a way that it seems he has multiple women, which is quite cute. The thing is that Cleese does not have any women in the movie except for Willa at the end. And of course the bosses' son is quite jealous about this. Fierce Creatures is a pretty good movie and sticks to what is expected from Monty Python. Those who appreciated Monty Python will find that this movie is just as enjoyable.

    A little background first: I remember reading a magazine article where John Cleese talks up this movie as being very funny. But later on I would learn that the original movie, after being shot, got a bad reception from preview audiences so they redid the whole thing. The revised version is hardly good either. A trite premise: a conglomerate head (based on Rupert Murdoch but not resembling him) happens to obtain a failing zoo as part of a major package purchase and wants to make it profitable by eliminating the "cuddly" animals and retaining the "fierce", and therefore supposedly exciting ones. (He's never heard of petting zoos?) Of course the people at the zoo try to resist the plan. A confusing plot, recycled and overused jokes, and poor performances by all involved make this a dud. I didn't like "A Fish Called Wanda" that much but it was certainly far better than this.

    Let's face it guys and gals, Animals are funny. So is John Cleese, Michael Palin, Kevin Kline and Jamie Lee Curtis. Fierce Creatures is not a sequel to the hilarious A Fish Called Wanda from 1988, it just a film that contains the same main actors playing entirely different characters. Cleese plays Rollo Lee a former Chinese policeman now Director of an English Zoo for a new parent company ingeniously named Octopus Inc. It is Octopus's policy to bring all businesses up to a rigid 20% profit margin or risk being closed down. Lee's philosophy is to get rid of all the sweet and cuddly animals and in his own words have 'a lethal weapon in every cage' Fierce Creatures only. Willa Weston starts work for Octopus only to find that the arm of the business she was to control has been sold off by Octopus's head man Rod McCain (Kevin Kline). She asks McCain if she can go to England and run the Zoo. What she doesn't count on is that the boss's embarrassing son Vince McCain (Kevin Kline) is going with her. Back in England the animal keepers are doing everything they can to convince that their animals are predatory killers in order to keep them at the zoo knowing that as placement in other zoo's are unlikely the animals face certain death. Willa's intention is to run the zoo well while still bringing the profit margin to the required standard but Vince's constant interference sees the chances dwindling with not only his embezzlement of funds but his tacky and degrading sponsorship deals. In A Fish Called Wanda, Michael Palin played Ken a guy who could hardly talk because of a debilitating stutter. In Fierce Creatures he plays Bugsy the Arachnid keeper who is an incessant talker the verbal contrast between the two characters is a bit of an in-joke but an hilarious one and I'm sure that this contrast was not lost on the audience. Like in A Fish Called Wanda Kevin Kline totally steals the show with his double role as Father & Son. Rod McCain is a tough confident Australian mogul so obviously based on Rupurt Murdoch it's untrue while his son is relatively unsuccessful an embassement to his father and has real issues when it comes to dealing with people. I found Fierce creatures very funny and in many ways far superior to 'Wanda'. Some great appearances by other wonderful actors such as Ronnie Corbett, Maria Aitken, (who played Cleese's Wife in Wanda), Billie Brown as Rod's sycophantic Assistant Neville, Carey (yummy) Lowell and Robert Lyndsay. Cleese's daughter Cynthia also appears as she did in Wanda playing the small Mammals keeper. For those devotees of British Children's TV of the 70's and 80's look out for Derek Griffiths too. Cleese once said that his two biggest regrets in his life were marrying his third wife and making fierce Creatures. I can say to Mr Cleese now that Fierce Creatures is nothing to be embarrassed about it's a great and funny movie and one he should be proud of. Another in joke is that the zoo is called Marwood Zoo, which incidentally, is Cleese's middle name. Enjoy!!!

    A follow-up to the wildly popular 'A Fish Called Wanda', starring the same four legendary actors, John Cleese, Jamie Lee Curtis, Kevin Kline and Michael Palin. 'Fierce Creatures' is a Decent Flick, that hasn't managed a cult following, that is because, it's comparison is to a really mighty film! If a direct sequel, I also would've been a tad underwhelmed. But, as it plays it safe by claiming it as a follow up, I didn't go thinking of watching another 'Wanda'. To be honest, 'Fierce Creatures' is dumb, but at the same, it's funny, nonetheless. 'Fierce Creatures' centers around a British zoo which has recently been acquired by New Zealand businessman Rod McCain played by Kline and put under the management of Rollo Lee played by Cleese. In order to boost profits, Lee decides to institute a "fierce creatures" policy that means, that only potentially deadly animals will be featured in the zoo. Clesse's Writing is funny at parts, but at times, it's dumb. Yet, I found the climax to be fairly entertaining. Fred Schepisi and Robert Young direct this comedy well. Cinematography, Editing, Art Design, are proper. Performance-Wise: Kline is excellent in both the roles, and truly is the funniest of the lot. Clesse, like always, gets his timing right. Jamie Lee Curtis is good. Michael Palin doesn't get much scope here. Robert Lindsay is passable. On the whole, A Decent One-Time Watch.
