    After The Brady Bunch Movie was a surprisingly success in 1995, just a year later, A Very Brady Sequel was made, continuing the line of Brady Bunch movies that were paying homage to the original series, but also lampooning them by parodying their cheeriness and their persistent nice-ness. In my original review of The Brady Bunch Movie, which I did in song (I also planned to do this one in song as well, but we all need to be serious sooner or later), I took the original Television show's theme song and rewrote the lyrics to replicate my thoughts on the film. I said in the third verse, "And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie." I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities. The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse. While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, "George Glass" (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture. Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness. We do not get much in the area of outsider reactions, but we didn't in the first one either, so perhaps it wasn't the filmmaker's prime intent. There are certain pictures we can not help but like, and The Brady Bunch films are two of mine. They're silly, deranged, yet deeply, weirdly satisfying and self-aware - the best part of all. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Tim Matheson, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, and Jesse Lee Soffer. Directed by: Arlene Stanford.

    First off, it should go without saying that The Brady Bunch was one of the worst, lamest, stupidest shows on television, but it goes without saying, too, that a lot of forty-and- fiftysomethings disagree. That, I think, is pretty much solely because it reminds them of their childhood, when most of them were happier, and had their whole life ahead of them, and any show that they remember watching in their youth, and that has some semblance of the styles, values and attitudes of that era, regardless of how bad the writing is, will do the same thing for them. With dialogue and behavior so brain-damaged it's almost a surreal experience to watch, it's perfect fodder for a satire. It should have been done in the late seventies, of course, a few years after it was cancelled, but better late than never. Unfortunately, these are affectionate satires created by people who seemingly actually liked the show, but they still work because the jokes are so dead-on and they string all the elements of the show together to create simple, entertaining plots. They're actually very campy, which is probably the best way to approach this immaterial material. The sequel, for a change, is the superior of the two. The first one was kind of boring, which is the worst thing a satire can be. The plot of the stolen horse in the sequel is appropriately ludicrous. Christine Taylor as Marcia bears a freakily uncanny resemblance to Maureen McCormick. Olivia Hack creates a classic distortion of Cindy. The only characters that don't quite work are Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg, using facial mannerisms that parody straight-edge 70's nerds in general but not Greg in particular, and Shelley Long as Carol. There's always something subtly sad and pitiful about Shelly Long's face, voice and mannerisms in everything she's acted in. It works for Jay Pritchett's ex-wife and Diane Chambers, but is precisely wrong for Carol Brady. Her character seems like it thinks deeply and gets depressed, which makes the character too three-dimensional. Tim Matheson as Carol's fake ex-husband is humorously self-serving and unctuous. It's just personal taste, but I found the short-sleeve Banlon shirts he wears in almost every scene really annoying. Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo was great. I don't see the satirical significance of having Rosie O'Donnell there though. There was one missed opportunity for a good joke. After the scene where Roy has a trip after eating spaghetti in which Alice accidentally put his stash of psychedelic mushrooms, he asks Marsha, "Who put the psychedelic mushrooms in the spaghetti?" She should have said, "Go ask Alice. I think she'll know."

    I hated the original "Brady Bunch"--the show was totally saccharine and about as edgy as a basketball! When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film. Here, the plot is much sillier and the film is much more daring--going some sick places that the last film never dared. Jan is back--and even crazier than before and simply a hoot. And, there is a totally sick plot involving Marsha and Greg that had me falling on the floor laughing. One of the only reservations about the film is that it, unlike the TV show, there is some family-unfriendly humor. It was very, very funny and welcome...but not for the younguns. The other is that to enjoy and appreciate the film, you really need to have seen the original show. If you never saw the show, you will miss a lot of the references and won't enjoy it nearly as much. So, as a result, here is how I rate the film: 9 if you've seen the original show and hated it and 7 if you've never seen it and 2 if you LOVE the original show and can't imagine anyone lampooning this 'pure genius' (yeah, right).

    "Cindy: You can't take my mommy! / Marcia: Cindy's right! Take Jan!" Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movieWhat first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie  1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family "Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness" was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or "menage a trois" would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time ! All of that through the situations of the main plot : a fake father (I loved the way he turns into Brady's victim !), stolen statue, kidnapped mother, an adventure to bring her back.. and so on. As you see, the comedy here works on 2 levels (the irony of one out-of-its-time family, and a tale of how this family must get together) and no wonder folks, since one of the movie's makers is (Harry Elfont). He is not a scriptwriter with too many works on him, only too interesting comedies like (Josie and the Pussycats  2001) or (Surviving Christmas  2004). And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet. The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked. And who might forget the dialog of the oldest boy with his fake father about girls, or the one of the mom and the airport's employee (misunderstanding at its top). Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance : this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?! I have no idea ! With the short appearances of (John Hillerman) from (Magnum), and (Barbara Eden) from (I Dream of Jeannie), in nearly their famous TV characters, it's more than obvious that it's not a homage to the TV at the 1960s or the 1970s; it's rather a homage to the classic TV as a whole, to reflect unquestionable loyalty and honoring, and refute any supposed toying or disgracing. The average length of shots without laughing = 10 seconds ! It amuses more than any big production comedy with big names. And it delivers even for anyone didn't watch the original TV show too. In one word : it is a classic in despite of any box office or any pedant critic. Finally : "Roy : Marcia. Oh, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. You have grown up to be so gorgeous! / Marcia : I know / Roy : And Jan. My dear Jan... Isn't Marcia gorgeous?!"

    Fans of the original series divide on this take-off of the show where Carol's original husband shows up alive, apparently looking for a lost treasure that could lead to a lot of money. The only good thing about it is that it would mean Greg and Marcia aren't really siblings anymore as they FINALLY realize what growing up means to their bodies. As with the first movie, some of the show's original scenarios are also played out, including Greg moving up to the attic, dating his sister's rival for cheerleader captain, as well as Marcia dating his rival on the basketball squad. Peter goes to work at his father's firm (I thought it was Greg who got the job in the original series), Jan still deals with her personal insecurities, Bobby becomes a junior detective, and Cindy is still obsessed with her doll. The only good thing that they got the rest of the scenarios in from the original series is that it means there won't be another sequel starring this clan of a misplaced family, stuck in the 70's. 2 out of 10 stars is a gift, in my opinion.

    If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. As with the first one, it goes with the theme of putting a slick, modern-day antagonist against the clueless Bradys, and having the Bradys consistently kick him in the balls. They go off on a few more of the themes of the original (the Jan vs. Marcia rivalry, Gary Cole's spot-on parody of Mike Brady's pompous pontificating), but it also mines some great new material. One of the best gags is the uncomfortable incestuous relationship that results from Greg and Marcia sharing their room in the attic. There's also great parodies of the Brady Bunch animated series, bad musical numbers, and the Hawaiian Vacation episode. There are some dud gags as well, but the filmmakers once again took great-- possibly obsessive-- care to replicate the costumes, dialogue, sets, editing, and cinematography of the original Brady Bunch series. Juxtaposing this with the modern themes, and the fantastic parodying of the original series makes for another fun Brady movie.

    A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son. If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, contact me by e-mail.

    Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole. This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures. The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new "incest" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia ("Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up "tripping with the Bradys". While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one. As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.

    The ages are weird and not really relevant. For example, the lady who plays the second oldest girl was born on 1969. Yet the movie was released in 1996. She'd be like 27, and in the movie she looks like 12 years old or something. Christine Taylor who plays the oldest girl is 2 years younger. I don't know about the rest of the cast. Something tells me this movie wasn't filmed in a year. It was probably filmed over 10 years or something. Anyway,this film was pretty good except for some visual "weirdness". I reckon the long lost husband is an idiot. The plot was simple, not many other rubbish and junk. But anyway, overall I give 6/10.

    Okay, I'm glad that they made a sequel to the original film. In this film, Carol's first husband, Roy Martin, supposedly returns to reunite with his beautiful wife and three blonde daughters. Unfortunately, he's not who or what he appears to be. He seems trapped in Brady's world where cable television is far too out there for them and where dysfunctional seems to be the norm. Greg and Marcia get new digs in the attic with creepy sexual tension between them while Jan fakes a new boyfriend. I love the coffee house scene where Greg and Marcia are double dating and where Jan and her fake boyfriend show up. Well, the fake first husband is only after Carol to get a horse that could pay him 20 million dollars to Hawaii to the anxious buyer. Yes, the plane ride to Hawaii is one to remember. There's singing and dancing and those Bradys are at it again. It's just a fun film to watch over and over. Nothing serious!

And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet. The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked. And who might forget the dialog of the oldest boy with his fake father about girls, or the one of the mom and the airport's employee (misunderstanding at its top). Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance : this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?! I have no idea ! With the short appearances of (John Hillerman) from (Magnum), and (Barbara Eden) from (I Dream of Jeannie), in nearly their famous TV characters, it's more than obvious that it's not a homage to the TV at the 1960s or the 1970s; it's rather a homage to the classic TV as a whole, to reflect unquestionable loyalty and honoring, and refute any supposed toying or disgracing. The average length of shots without laughing = 10 seconds ! It amuses more than any big production comedy with big names. And it delivers even for anyone didn't watch the original TV show too. In one word : it is a classic in despite of any box office or any pedant critic. Finally : "Roy : Marcia. Oh, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. You have grown up to be so gorgeous! / Marcia : I know / Roy : And Jan. My dear Jan... Isn't Marcia gorgeous?!"

    Fans of the original series divide on this take-off of the show where Carol's original husband shows up alive, apparently looking for a lost treasure that could lead to a lot of money. The only good thing about it is that it would mean Greg and Marcia aren't really siblings anymore as they FINALLY realize what growing up means to their bodies. As with the first movie, some of the show's original scenarios are also played out, including Greg moving up to the attic, dating his sister's rival for cheerleader captain, as well as Marcia dating his rival on the basketball squad. Peter goes to work at his father's firm (I thought it was Greg who got the job in the original series), Jan still deals with her personal insecurities, Bobby becomes a junior detective, and Cindy is still obsessed with her doll. The only good thing that they got the rest of the scenarios in from the original series is that it means there won't be another sequel starring this clan of a misplaced family, stuck in the 70's. 2 out of 10 stars is a gift, in my opinion.

    If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. As with the first one, it goes with the theme of putting a slick, modern-day antagonist against the clueless Bradys, and having the Bradys consistently kick him in the balls. They go off on a few more of the themes of the original (the Jan vs. Marcia rivalry, Gary Cole's spot-on parody of Mike Brady's pompous pontificating), but it also mines some great new material. One of the best gags is the uncomfortable incestuous relationship that results from Greg and Marcia sharing their room in the attic. There's also great parodies of the Brady Bunch animated series, bad musical numbers, and the Hawaiian Vacation episode. There are some dud gags as well, but the filmmakers once again took great-- possibly obsessive-- care to replicate the costumes, dialogue, sets, editing, and cinematography of the original Brady Bunch series. Juxtaposing this with the modern themes, and the fantastic parodying of the original series makes for another fun Brady movie.

    A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son. If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, contact me by e-mail.

    Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole. This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures. The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new "incest" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia ("Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up "tripping with the Bradys". While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one. As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.

    The ages are weird and not really relevant. For example, the lady who plays the second oldest girl was born on 1969. Yet the movie was released in 1996. She'd be like 27, and in the movie she looks like 12 years old or something. Christine Taylor who plays the oldest girl is 2 years younger. I don't know about the rest of the cast. Something tells me this movie wasn't filmed in a year. It was probably filmed over 10 years or something. Anyway,this film was pretty good except for some visual "weirdness". I reckon the long lost husband is an idiot. The plot was simple, not many other rubbish and junk. But anyway, overall I give 6/10.

    Okay, I'm glad that they made a sequel to the original film. In this film, Carol's first husband, Roy Martin, supposedly returns to reunite with his beautiful wife and three blonde daughters. Unfortunately, he's not who or what he appears to be. He seems trapped in Brady's world where cable television is far too out there for them and where dysfunctional seems to be the norm. Greg and Marcia get new digs in the attic with creepy sexual tension between them while Jan fakes a new boyfriend. I love the coffee house scene where Greg and Marcia are double dating and where Jan and her fake boyfriend show up. Well, the fake first husband is only after Carol to get a horse that could pay him 20 million dollars to Hawaii to the anxious buyer. Yes, the plane ride to Hawaii is one to remember. There's singing and dancing and those Bradys are at it again. It's just a fun film to watch over and over. Nothing serious!

    After The Brady Bunch Movie was a surprisingly success in 1995, just a year later, A Very Brady Sequel was made, continuing the line of Brady Bunch movies that were paying homage to the original series, but also lampooning them by parodying their cheeriness and their persistent nice-ness. In my original review of The Brady Bunch Movie, which I did in song (I also planned to do this one in song as well, but we all need to be serious sooner or later), I took the original Television show's theme song and rewrote the lyrics to replicate my thoughts on the film. I said in the third verse, "And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie." I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities. The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse. While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, "George Glass" (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture. Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness. We do not get much in the area of outsider reactions, but we didn't in the first one either, so perhaps it wasn't the filmmaker's prime intent. There are certain pictures we can not help but like, and The Brady Bunch films are two of mine. They're silly, deranged, yet deeply, weirdly satisfying and self-aware - the best part of all. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Tim Matheson, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, and Jesse Lee Soffer. Directed by: Arlene Stanford.

    First off, it should go without saying that The Brady Bunch was one of the worst, lamest, stupidest shows on television, but it goes without saying, too, that a lot of forty-and- fiftysomethings disagree. That, I think, is pretty much solely because it reminds them of their childhood, when most of them were happier, and had their whole life ahead of them, and any show that they remember watching in their youth, and that has some semblance of the styles, values and attitudes of that era, regardless of how bad the writing is, will do the same thing for them. With dialogue and behavior so brain-damaged it's almost a surreal experience to watch, it's perfect fodder for a satire. It should have been done in the late seventies, of course, a few years after it was cancelled, but better late than never. Unfortunately, these are affectionate satires created by people who seemingly actually liked the show, but they still work because the jokes are so dead-on and they string all the elements of the show together to create simple, entertaining plots. They're actually very campy, which is probably the best way to approach this immaterial material. The sequel, for a change, is the superior of the two. The first one was kind of boring, which is the worst thing a satire can be. The plot of the stolen horse in the sequel is appropriately ludicrous. Christine Taylor as Marcia bears a freakily uncanny resemblance to Maureen McCormick. Olivia Hack creates a classic distortion of Cindy. The only characters that don't quite work are Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg, using facial mannerisms that parody straight-edge 70's nerds in general but not Greg in particular, and Shelley Long as Carol. There's always something subtly sad and pitiful about Shelly Long's face, voice and mannerisms in everything she's acted in. It works for Jay Pritchett's ex-wife and Diane Chambers, but is precisely wrong for Carol Brady. Her character seems like it thinks deeply and gets depressed, which makes the character too three-dimensional. Tim Matheson as Carol's fake ex-husband is humorously self-serving and unctuous. It's just personal taste, but I found the short-sleeve Banlon shirts he wears in almost every scene really annoying. Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo was great. I don't see the satirical significance of having Rosie O'Donnell there though. There was one missed opportunity for a good joke. After the scene where Roy has a trip after eating spaghetti in which Alice accidentally put his stash of psychedelic mushrooms, he asks Marsha, "Who put the psychedelic mushrooms in the spaghetti?" She should have said, "Go ask Alice. I think she'll know."

    I hated the original "Brady Bunch"--the show was totally saccharine and about as edgy as a basketball! When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film. Here, the plot is much sillier and the film is much more daring--going some sick places that the last film never dared. Jan is back--and even crazier than before and simply a hoot. And, there is a totally sick plot involving Marsha and Greg that had me falling on the floor laughing. One of the only reservations about the film is that it, unlike the TV show, there is some family-unfriendly humor. It was very, very funny and welcome...but not for the younguns. The other is that to enjoy and appreciate the film, you really need to have seen the original show. If you never saw the show, you will miss a lot of the references and won't enjoy it nearly as much. So, as a result, here is how I rate the film: 9 if you've seen the original show and hated it and 7 if you've never seen it and 2 if you LOVE the original show and can't imagine anyone lampooning this 'pure genius' (yeah, right).

    "Cindy: You can't take my mommy! / Marcia: Cindy's right! Take Jan!" Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movieWhat first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie  1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family "Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness" was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or "menage a trois" would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time ! All of that through the situations of the main plot : a fake father (I loved the way he turns into Brady's victim !), stolen statue, kidnapped mother, an adventure to bring her back.. and so on. As you see, the comedy here works on 2 levels (the irony of one out-of-its-time family, and a tale of how this family must get together) and no wonder folks, since one of the movie's makers is (Harry Elfont). He is not a scriptwriter with too many works on him, only too interesting comedies like (Josie and the Pussycats  2001) or (Surviving Christmas  2004). And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet. The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked.

Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance : this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?!

Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities. The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse. While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, "George Glass" (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture. Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness. We do not get much in the area of outsider reactions, but we didn't in the first one either, so perhaps it wasn't the filmmaker's prime intent. There are certain pictures we can not help but like, and The Brady Bunch films are two of mine. They're silly, deranged, yet deeply, weirdly satisfying and self-aware - the best part of all. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Tim Matheson, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, and Jesse Lee Soffer. Directed by: Arlene Stanford.

    First off, it should go without saying that The Brady Bunch was one of the worst, lamest, stupidest shows on television, but it goes without saying, too, that a lot of forty-and- fiftysomethings disagree. That, I think, is pretty much solely because it reminds them of their childhood, when most of them were happier, and had their whole life ahead of them, and any show that they remember watching in their youth, and that has some semblance of the styles, values and attitudes of that era, regardless of how bad the writing is, will do the same thing for them. With dialogue and behavior so brain-damaged it's almost a surreal experience to watch, it's perfect fodder for a satire. It should have been done in the late seventies, of course, a few years after it was cancelled, but better late than never. Unfortunately, these are affectionate satires created by people who seemingly actually liked the show, but they still work because the jokes are so dead-on and they string all the elements of the show together to create simple, entertaining plots. They're actually very campy, which is probably the best way to approach this immaterial material. The sequel, for a change, is the superior of the two. The first one was kind of boring, which is the worst thing a satire can be. The plot of the stolen horse in the sequel is appropriately ludicrous. Christine Taylor as Marcia bears a freakily uncanny resemblance to Maureen McCormick. Olivia Hack creates a classic distortion of Cindy. The only characters that don't quite work are Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg, using facial mannerisms that parody straight-edge 70's nerds in general but not Greg in particular, and Shelley Long as Carol. There's always something subtly sad and pitiful about Shelly Long's face, voice and mannerisms in everything she's acted in. It works for Jay Pritchett's ex-wife and Diane Chambers, but is precisely wrong for Carol Brady. Her character seems like it thinks deeply and gets depressed, which makes the character too three-dimensional. Tim Matheson as Carol's fake ex-husband is humorously self-serving and unctuous. It's just personal taste, but I found the short-sleeve Banlon shirts he wears in almost every scene really annoying. Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo was great. I don't see the satirical significance of having Rosie O'Donnell there though. There was one missed opportunity for a good joke. After the scene where Roy has a trip after eating spaghetti in which Alice accidentally put his stash of psychedelic mushrooms, he asks Marsha, "Who put the psychedelic mushrooms in the spaghetti?" She should have said, "Go ask Alice. I think she'll know."

    I hated the original "Brady Bunch"--the show was totally saccharine and about as edgy as a basketball! When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film. Here, the plot is much sillier and the film is much more daring--going some sick places that the last film never dared. Jan is back--and even crazier than before and simply a hoot. And, there is a totally sick plot involving Marsha and Greg that had me falling on the floor laughing. One of the only reservations about the film is that it, unlike the TV show, there is some family-unfriendly humor. It was very, very funny and welcome...but not for the younguns. The other is that to enjoy and appreciate the film, you really need to have seen the original show. If you never saw the show, you will miss a lot of the references and won't enjoy it nearly as much. So, as a result, here is how I rate the film: 9 if you've seen the original show and hated it and 7 if you've never seen it and 2 if you LOVE the original show and can't imagine anyone lampooning this 'pure genius' (yeah, right).

    "Cindy: You can't take my mommy! / Marcia: Cindy's right! Take Jan!" Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movieWhat first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie  1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family "Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness" was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or "menage a trois" would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time ! All of that through the situations of the main plot : a fake father (I loved the way he turns into Brady's victim !), stolen statue, kidnapped mother, an adventure to bring her back.. and so on. As you see, the comedy here works on 2 levels (the irony of one out-of-its-time family, and a tale of how this family must get together) and no wonder folks, since one of the movie's makers is (Harry Elfont). He is not a scriptwriter with too many works on him, only too interesting comedies like (Josie and the Pussycats  2001) or (Surviving Christmas  2004). And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet. The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked. And who might forget the dialog of the oldest boy with his fake father about girls, or the one of the mom and the airport's employee (misunderstanding at its top). Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance : this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?! I have no idea ! With the short appearances of (John Hillerman) from (Magnum), and (Barbara Eden) from (I Dream of Jeannie), in nearly their famous TV characters, it's more than obvious that it's not a homage to the TV at the 1960s or the 1970s; it's rather a homage to the classic TV as a whole, to reflect unquestionable loyalty and honoring, and refute any supposed toying or disgracing. The average length of shots without laughing = 10 seconds ! It amuses more than any big production comedy with big names. And it delivers even for anyone didn't watch the original TV show too. In one word : it is a classic in despite of any box office or any pedant critic. Finally : "Roy : Marcia. Oh, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. You have grown up to be so gorgeous! / Marcia : I know / Roy : And Jan. My dear Jan... Isn't Marcia gorgeous?!"

    Fans of the original series divide on this take-off of the show where Carol's original husband shows up alive, apparently looking for a lost treasure that could lead to a lot of money. The only good thing about it is that it would mean Greg and Marcia aren't really siblings anymore as they FINALLY realize what growing up means to their bodies. As with the first movie, some of the show's original scenarios are also played out, including Greg moving up to the attic, dating his sister's rival for cheerleader captain, as well as Marcia dating his rival on the basketball squad. Peter goes to work at his father's firm (I thought it was Greg who got the job in the original series), Jan still deals with her personal insecurities, Bobby becomes a junior detective, and Cindy is still obsessed with her doll. The only good thing that they got the rest of the scenarios in from the original series is that it means there won't be another sequel starring this clan of a misplaced family, stuck in the 70's. 2 out of 10 stars is a gift, in my opinion.

    If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. As with the first one, it goes with the theme of putting a slick, modern-day antagonist against the clueless Bradys, and having the Bradys consistently kick him in the balls. They go off on a few more of the themes of the original (the Jan vs. Marcia rivalry, Gary Cole's spot-on parody of Mike Brady's pompous pontificating), but it also mines some great new material. One of the best gags is the uncomfortable incestuous relationship that results from Greg and Marcia sharing their room in the attic. There's also great parodies of the Brady Bunch animated series, bad musical numbers, and the Hawaiian Vacation episode. There are some dud gags as well, but the filmmakers once again took great-- possibly obsessive-- care to replicate the costumes, dialogue, sets, editing, and cinematography of the original Brady Bunch series. Juxtaposing this with the modern themes, and the fantastic parodying of the original series makes for another fun Brady movie.

    A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son. If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, contact me by e-mail.

    Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole. This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures. The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new "incest" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia ("Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up "tripping with the Bradys". While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one. As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.

    The ages are weird and not really relevant. For example, the lady who plays the second oldest girl was born on 1969. Yet the movie was released in 1996. She'd be like 27, and in the movie she looks like 12 years old or something. Christine Taylor who plays the oldest girl is 2 years younger. I don't know about the rest of the cast. Something tells me this movie wasn't filmed in a year. It was probably filmed over 10 years or something. Anyway,this film was pretty good except for some visual "weirdness". I reckon the long lost husband is an idiot. The plot was simple, not many other rubbish and junk. But anyway, overall I give 6/10.

    Okay, I'm glad that they made a sequel to the original film. In this film, Carol's first husband, Roy Martin, supposedly returns to reunite with his beautiful wife and three blonde daughters. Unfortunately, he's not who or what he appears to be. He seems trapped in Brady's world where cable television is far too out there for them and where dysfunctional seems to be the norm. Greg and Marcia get new digs in the attic with creepy sexual tension between them while Jan fakes a new boyfriend. I love the coffee house scene where Greg and Marcia are double dating and where Jan and her fake boyfriend show up. Well, the fake first husband is only after Carol to get a horse that could pay him 20 million dollars to Hawaii to the anxious buyer. Yes, the plane ride to Hawaii is one to remember. There's singing and dancing and those Bradys are at it again. It's just a fun film to watch over and over. Nothing serious!

    After The Brady Bunch Movie was a surprisingly success in 1995, just a year later, A Very Brady Sequel was made, continuing the line of Brady Bunch movies that were paying homage to the original series, but also lampooning them by parodying their cheeriness and their persistent nice-ness. In my original review of The Brady Bunch Movie, which I did in song (I also planned to do this one in song as well, but we all need to be serious sooner or later), I took the original Television show's theme song and rewrote the lyrics to replicate my thoughts on the film. I said in the third verse, "And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie." I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities. The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated.

In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse. While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle.

    If you liked the first one, you'll like this one as well. As with the first one, it goes with the theme of putting a slick, modern-day antagonist against the clueless Bradys, and having the Bradys consistently kick him in the balls. They go off on a few more of the themes of the original (the Jan vs. Marcia rivalry, Gary Cole's spot-on parody of Mike Brady's pompous pontificating), but it also mines some great new material. One of the best gags is the uncomfortable incestuous relationship that results from Greg and Marcia sharing their room in the attic. There's also great parodies of the Brady Bunch animated series, bad musical numbers, and the Hawaiian Vacation episode. There are some dud gags as well, but the filmmakers once again took great-- possibly obsessive-- care to replicate the costumes, dialogue, sets, editing, and cinematography of the original Brady Bunch series. Juxtaposing this with the modern themes, and the fantastic parodying of the original series makes for another fun Brady movie.

    A sequel that's even better than the first part is a rare occurrence, even more fun than the first film. Once again, it's Jennifer Elise Cox who steals the show with a number of hilarious moments. This overlooked actress has (or had?) the potential to be another Goldie Hawn, but, alas, the major hindrance in her career going forward is that she isn't a Spelling, a Coppola, an Arquette, a Fonda, or a Barrymore. Having lack of family connections is a truly unforgivable crime, and probably a major reason why she didn't make a breakthrough. If Drew Barrymore, for example, had 5% of her talent, she'd be the no.1 female star in the past 2 decades. I don't think much of child and teen actors, but Cox is possibly the funniest teenager I have ever seen in a movie, and one of the funniest actresses, as well. Her semi-retarded, ultra-naive facial expressions, so perfectly suited to this role, and her delivery of lines are absolutely perfect. Matheson is also very good, as is the guy playing the oldest son. If you want to see my Hollywood Nepotism List, contact me by e-mail.

    Another of the rare breed of sequels-better-than-the-original movies, A Very Brady Sequel continues with the idea of the 70's Brady's being stuck in the present (in this case, the mid-90's) from the first film. While the original movie was very funny (grunge music nonwithstanding), the total lack of a plot was a pretty obvious hole. This time around we're actually treated to a decent storyline (as relative as can be to the entire Brady aura, that is) involving Mrs. Brady's first, long-lost husband, Roy. This adds a whole additional avenue for laughs as we now have an straight outsider thrust directly into the everyday realm of the Bradys. As he tries to enact his nefarious scheme, he's dragged kicking and screaming through their loopy antics, breakout songs and Mr. Brady's lectures. The same Brady cast returns and they're as spot-on as ever. A bulk of the laughs continue to go to insecure Jan, as she tries to convince everyone she's a viable person. A new "incest" angle is introduced between Greg and Marcia ("Does this mean we're not really brother and sister?") that plays very well throughout. Tim Matheson is an excellent addition as Roy Brady, and he gets some scene stealing parts as well, particularly when he ends up "tripping with the Bradys". While Sam seems to have disappeared in this one, we do see a couple of other Brady icons who seemed to have been missed in the first movie, though blink and you'll miss them. Surprisingly no real-life cameos in this one. As with the first movie, the more familiar you are with the TV series the more you will enjoy this movie. If you've never watched the Bradys then you'll probably want to skip these movies as most of the laughs are derived from inside references to the episodes, but if you have, then this is highly recommended and one of my faves.

    The ages are weird and not really relevant. For example, the lady who plays the second oldest girl was born on 1969. Yet the movie was released in 1996. She'd be like 27, and in the movie she looks like 12 years old or something. Christine Taylor who plays the oldest girl is 2 years younger. I don't know about the rest of the cast. Something tells me this movie wasn't filmed in a year. It was probably filmed over 10 years or something. Anyway,this film was pretty good except for some visual "weirdness". I reckon the long lost husband is an idiot. The plot was simple, not many other rubbish and junk. But anyway, overall I give 6/10.

    Okay, I'm glad that they made a sequel to the original film. In this film, Carol's first husband, Roy Martin, supposedly returns to reunite with his beautiful wife and three blonde daughters. Unfortunately, he's not who or what he appears to be. He seems trapped in Brady's world where cable television is far too out there for them and where dysfunctional seems to be the norm. Greg and Marcia get new digs in the attic with creepy sexual tension between them while Jan fakes a new boyfriend. I love the coffee house scene where Greg and Marcia are double dating and where Jan and her fake boyfriend show up. Well, the fake first husband is only after Carol to get a horse that could pay him 20 million dollars to Hawaii to the anxious buyer. Yes, the plane ride to Hawaii is one to remember. There's singing and dancing and those Bradys are at it again. It's just a fun film to watch over and over. Nothing serious!

    After The Brady Bunch Movie was a surprisingly success in 1995, just a year later, A Very Brady Sequel was made, continuing the line of Brady Bunch movies that were paying homage to the original series, but also lampooning them by parodying their cheeriness and their persistent nice-ness. In my original review of The Brady Bunch Movie, which I did in song (I also planned to do this one in song as well, but we all need to be serious sooner or later), I took the original Television show's theme song and rewrote the lyrics to replicate my thoughts on the film. I said in the third verse, "And if one day I'm strick-en with cyni-cism. And you look onto this review as not groovy. You can go on to not trust me. After I enjoyed The Brady Bunch Movie." I suppose the same line is valid in this review too. I'm not necessarily proud that I enjoyed both film adaptations, but there are times when we can not help what we liked. Again, from the first frame, I enjoyed the Brady's overwhelming eccentricities. The storyline is pure simplicity; the Brady's are stuck in the seventies while the whole world has kindly shifted into the nineties, therefore, capturing the idea that the Brady's, while timeless, are also pretty outdated. Mike Brady (reprised by Gary Cole) is contemplating what to give his darling gold-haired wife, Carol (Shelley Long) for their anniversary, but in the nick of time, a man claiming to be Carol's first husband named Roy (Tim Matheson) shows up and tries to win Carol back. In reality, he's a snaky con-man, searching for a statue of a marble horse. While the family naively welcomes Roy back home, Greg is hasty about the whole thing, yet never questions if something is really behind this alleged miracle. It is never truly said, however, how Roy managed to know all there was to know about the family, but nevermind that small little detail. The subplots follow other Brady characters, as expected, such as Jan trying to boast to the family about her new boyfriend, "George Glass" (who is imaginary), Marcia and Peter possibly falling in love, and the family traveling to Hawaii in the latter half of the picture. Again, much like the original film, the whole idea and premise is a little anarchic, but not to the point of utter senselessness. We do not get much in the area of outsider reactions, but we didn't in the first one either, so perhaps it wasn't the filmmaker's prime intent. There are certain pictures we can not help but like, and The Brady Bunch films are two of mine. They're silly, deranged, yet deeply, weirdly satisfying and self-aware - the best part of all. Starring: Gary Cole, Shelley Long, Tim Matheson, Henriette Mantel, Christopher Daniel Barnes, Christine Taylor, Paul Sutera, Jennifer Elise Cox, and Jesse Lee Soffer. Directed by: Arlene Stanford.

    First off, it should go without saying that The Brady Bunch was one of the worst, lamest, stupidest shows on television, but it goes without saying, too, that a lot of forty-and- fiftysomethings disagree. That, I think, is pretty much solely because it reminds them of their childhood, when most of them were happier, and had their whole life ahead of them, and any show that they remember watching in their youth, and that has some semblance of the styles, values and attitudes of that era, regardless of how bad the writing is, will do the same thing for them. With dialogue and behavior so brain-damaged it's almost a surreal experience to watch, it's perfect fodder for a satire. It should have been done in the late seventies, of course, a few years after it was cancelled, but better late than never. Unfortunately, these are affectionate satires created by people who seemingly actually liked the show, but they still work because the jokes are so dead-on and they string all the elements of the show together to create simple, entertaining plots. They're actually very campy, which is probably the best way to approach this immaterial material. The sequel, for a change, is the superior of the two. The first one was kind of boring, which is the worst thing a satire can be. The plot of the stolen horse in the sequel is appropriately ludicrous. Christine Taylor as Marcia bears a freakily uncanny resemblance to Maureen McCormick. Olivia Hack creates a classic distortion of Cindy. The only characters that don't quite work are Christopher Daniel Barnes as Greg, using facial mannerisms that parody straight-edge 70's nerds in general but not Greg in particular, and Shelley Long as Carol. There's always something subtly sad and pitiful about Shelly Long's face, voice and mannerisms in everything she's acted in. It works for Jay Pritchett's ex-wife and Diane Chambers, but is precisely wrong for Carol Brady. Her character seems like it thinks deeply and gets depressed, which makes the character too three-dimensional. Tim Matheson as Carol's fake ex-husband is humorously self-serving and unctuous. It's just personal taste, but I found the short-sleeve Banlon shirts he wears in almost every scene really annoying. Zsa Zsa Gabor's cameo was great. I don't see the satirical significance of having Rosie O'Donnell there though. There was one missed opportunity for a good joke. After the scene where Roy has a trip after eating spaghetti in which Alice accidentally put his stash of psychedelic mushrooms, he asks Marsha, "Who put the psychedelic mushrooms in the spaghetti?" She should have said, "Go ask Alice. I think she'll know."

    I hated the original "Brady Bunch"--the show was totally saccharine and about as edgy as a basketball! When the Brady movie came out in 1995, I was thrilled--as the saccharine Brady family was gone and the movie had a wonderful way of making fun of itself. Because of this good-natured lampoon, I was excited to see the sequel--and it did not disappoint--being MUCH better, even, than the previous film. Here, the plot is much sillier and the film is much more daring--going some sick places that the last film never dared. Jan is back--and even crazier than before and simply a hoot. And, there is a totally sick plot involving Marsha and Greg that had me falling on the floor laughing. One of the only reservations about the film is that it, unlike the TV show, there is some family-unfriendly humor. It was very, very funny and welcome...but not for the younguns. The other is that to enjoy and appreciate the film, you really need to have seen the original show. If you never saw the show, you will miss a lot of the references and won't enjoy it nearly as much. So, as a result, here is how I rate the film: 9 if you've seen the original show and hated it and 7 if you've never seen it and 2 if you LOVE the original show and can't imagine anyone lampooning this 'pure genius' (yeah, right).

    "Cindy: You can't take my mommy! / Marcia: Cindy's right! Take Jan!" Without a doubt this is the best comic movie of 1996, but one of the best ever. It got nearly all what I need out of a comedy. The pace was the real hero of it; since uniquely the talented lines don't stop throughout the whole thing. This is compared to the first movieWhat first movie ?! Simply this one learned its lesson out of (The Brady Bunch Movie  1995). This time it's brighter, faster, and took the irony to the next level. Now the joke is on you Brady people ! Attractively the matter of making fun of the Brady family "Look at the hair, the clothes, the constant cheerfulness" was a stroke of genius. It's like what if the Brady Bunch came out of the reruns to our present day ?! This great no-time machine matter put them as they are in the middle of our world to live one of the sharpest paradoxes ever between not only the 1970s and 1990s, but also between the polished, so idealistic, American TV once and the reality's taste after 25 years; where the Brady songs would be misplaced, too gay, and annoying ! Or how the 90s's fashions, drugs, or "menage a trois" would affect the family.. sorry, THIS family! To be generally a brilliant Brady movie and Brady spoof in the same time ! All of that through the situations of the main plot : a fake father (I loved the way he turns into Brady's victim !), stolen statue, kidnapped mother, an adventure to bring her back.. and so on. As you see, the comedy here works on 2 levels (the irony of one out-of-its-time family, and a tale of how this family must get together) and no wonder folks, since one of the movie's makers is (Harry Elfont). He is not a scriptwriter with too many works on him, only too interesting comedies like (Josie and the Pussycats  2001) or (Surviving Christmas  2004). And I believe (AVBS) is his highest achievements yet. The dialog was crazily funny. OH MY GOD, you can't count the lines that really clicked. And who might forget the dialog of the oldest boy with his fake father about girls, or the one of the mom and the airport's employee (misunderstanding at its top). Let alone the creative and original comic situations (the oldest son searching for his lost mom while surfing, the scene in which we hear all the regretful testimonies even the Brady doll's !). And the performances, OHHH the performances ! For instance : this is the most funny role Christine Taylor ever made, Gary Cole wasn't more droll or charismatic, Shelley Long IS Carol Brady and its perfect parody as well, and how Jennifer Elise Cox could walk while shaking her braids this clever and this goofy ?! I have no idea ! With the short appearances of (John Hillerman) from (Magnum), and (Barbara Eden) from (I Dream of Jeannie), in nearly their famous TV characters, it's more than obvious that it's not a homage to the TV at the 1960s or the 1970s; it's rather a homage to the classic TV as a whole, to reflect unquestionable loyalty and honoring, and refute any supposed toying or disgracing. The average length of shots without laughing = 10 seconds ! It amuses more than any big production comedy with big names. And it delivers even for anyone didn't watch the original TV show too. In one word : it is a classic in despite of any box office or any pedant critic. Finally : "Roy : Marcia. Oh, Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. You have grown up to be so gorgeous! / Marcia : I know / Roy : And Jan. My dear Jan... Isn't Marcia gorgeous?!"

    Fans of the original series divide on this take-off of the show where Carol's original husband shows up alive, apparently looking for a lost treasure that could lead to a lot of money. The only good thing about it is that it would mean Greg and Marcia aren't really siblings anymore as they FINALLY realize what growing up means to their bodies. As with the first movie, some of the show's original scenarios are also played out, including Greg moving up to the attic, dating his sister's rival for cheerleader captain, as well as Marcia dating his rival on the basketball squad. Peter goes to work at his father's firm (I thought it was Greg who got the job in the original series), Jan still deals with her personal insecurities, Bobby becomes a junior detective, and Cindy is still obsessed with her doll. The only good thing that they got the rest of the scenarios in from the original series is that it means there won't be another sequel starring this clan of a misplaced family, stuck in the 70's. 2 out of 10 stars is a gift, in my opinion.
